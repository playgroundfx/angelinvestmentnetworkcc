Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 28.05.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

All three cryptocurrencies should continue rising in prices in the
impulse waves.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

The most recent section of the BTCUSD price chart shows that the market
has completed the descending movement. Wave [1] must have completed as a
regular impulse. There should be unfolding the bullish correction [2] as
a simple zigzag (A)-(B)-(C). The zigzag-shaped correction is about to
end soon, and the upward impulse wave (C) will start. The Bitcoin price
should be rising o a level of 48300.00, where wave [2] will be 61.8% of
wave [1].

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 37503.50, TP 48300.00

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

The XRPUSD market must have completed the first element of the double
zigzag, the motive wave (W) as a simple zigzag A-B-C. There is unfolding
the upward linking wave (X), which could be composed of three major sub-
waves A-B-C. The B zigzag should end soon, and the price will start
rising in the impulse sub-wave C towards a level of 1.187.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] today:

Buy 0.961 TP 1.187

* * *

## Elliott wave Ethereum analysis

The most recent chart section displays the down wave 1, which must have
completed as an impulse. The Ethereum price is now rising in the upward
correction 2, currently unfolding. Wave 2 should be a zigzag. Its middle
part, correction [B] is unfolding as a double zigzag. After the [B]
zigzag completes, the price should start rising in the [C] impulse to a
level of 3323.00, where wave 2 will be 61.8% of wave 1.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Buy 2660.96, TP 3323.00
