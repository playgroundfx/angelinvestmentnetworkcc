What to do with dollar? Forecast as of 28.05.2021Dmitri Demidenko

It is hard when there is now money, but it isn’t easy when there is too
much money. Where to invest the money not to lose it and make profits?
Should [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s go back to the USA and buy the US assets, or its better
to invest to in other countries’ assets? Let us discuss the Forex
outlook and make up a [EURUSD][1] trading plan.

## Weekly US dollar fundamental forecast

The road to hell is paved b good intentions. When the Fed flooded the
markets with huge amounts of cheap liquidity in the spring of 2020,
there was no reason to doubt its good intentions. Save the economy from
recession! Support stock indexes! Give people the money they need! Time
has passed, the recession has been left behind, but QE continues. A
natural question arises, what to do with dollars? Much depends on the
answer to this question, including the [EURUSD][1] future trends.

Judging by the surge in usage of the Fed’s repo facilities, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s
simply don’t know what to do with money. They deposited $485.3 billion
in central bank accounts at zero interest rates, exceeding the previous
high of $474.6 billion on New Year's Eve 2015.

And this situation is observed not only in the United States but
throughout the world. Due to massive incentives and strong domestic
demand, US imports are growing faster than exports. The current account
deficit relative to GDP is at its highest since 2008. More and more
dollars are falling into the hands of foreign [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s. What to do with
them? Should they invest in the US markets or buy assets in other
countries?

On the one hand, Joe Biden's intention to increase the size of the US
budget and national debt from the current $5.7 trillion and 100% of GDP
to $8 trillion and 117% of GDP by 2031 suggests that there will be no
shortage of Treasury bonds in the next decade, which contributes to the
growth of Treasury yields and the strengthening of the US dollar. On the
other hand, why should they need these securities or the [S&P 500][2],
whose estimates, including the P/E, are clearly overestimated? According
to Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank, the current twin-deficit situation
is similar to that of 2002-2007, when the USD index was falling. They
believe it is only a matter of time before [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s start looking for
more competitive international assets, which will press down the
greenback.

However, Morgan Stanley and Eurizon SLJ Capital believe that current
events should be compared to the 1980s and 1990s when the US dollar
strengthened in the face of large current account deficits, and BofA
Merrill Lynch argues that its impact on greenbacks will be evident
later.

US dollar bulls bet on American exclusivity and the leading pace of the
US growth over the global economy, which will lure [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s to the US
assets.

### Weekly [EURUSD][1] trading plan

In my opinion, the arguments of Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank look
more convincing. The USA may forget about its exclusivity as the last
parliaments in the European Union were set to back the ratification of
the €750-billion European recovery plan. The ratification of the EU law
will enable the European Commission to go to the markets in mid-June to
start borrowing cash it will then disburse in grants and cheap loans to
all EU countries over the coming years. Therefore, the [EURUSD][1]
should rally to 1.25 and higher in the medium term. In the short term,
the inability of the bulls to hold the price above 1.226 and 1.221
indicates their weakness, which makes it possible to enter short-term
sales in the direction of 1.213-1.215, 1.2085, and possibly 1.2045. But
traders should be cautious with sell trades.
