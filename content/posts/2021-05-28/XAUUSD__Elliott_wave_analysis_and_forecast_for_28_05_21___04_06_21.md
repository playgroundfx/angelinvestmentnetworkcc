XAUUSD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 28.05.21 – 04.06.21Alex
Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider short positions below the level of 1913.03
with a target of 1821.97 – 1794.22.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
1913.03 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 1958.14
– 2016.10.

 **Analysis:** an ascending third wave of larger degree (3) formed on
the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame, and a descending correction developed as wave (4),
supposedly. The fifth wave (5) appears to be forming on the H4 time
frame, with the first wave of smaller degree 1 of (5) formed inside.
Apparently, a downward correction is starting to form as wave 2 of (5)
on the H1 time frame. If this assumption is correct, the pair may be
expected to fall to the levels of 1821.97 – 1794.22. The level of
1913.03 is critical in this scenario as the breakout will enable the
pair to continue growing to the levels of 1958.14 – 2016.10.
