USDCHF: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 28.05.21 – 04.06.21Alex
Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions above the level of 0.8927
with a target of 0.9169 – 0.9476.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
0.8927 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of 0.8869
– 0.8751.

 **Analysis:** Daily time frame: presumably, a descending first wave of
larger degree (1) of 5 was formed and an ascending correction is now
developing as second wave (2) of 5. On the H4 time frame, wave A of (2)
was formed, and, presumably, wave B of (2) finished developing.
Apparently, wave с of В finished developing on the H1 time frame, with
wave (v) of c formed inside. If the presumption is correct, the pair may
be expected to rise to the levels of 0.9169 – 0.9476. The level of
0.8927 is critical in this scenario. Its breakout will allow the pair to
continue falling to the levels of 0.8869 – 0.8751.
