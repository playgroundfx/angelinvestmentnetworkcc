EURUSD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 28.05.21 – 04.06.21Alex
Geuta

 **Main scenario:** short positions will be relevant below the level of
1.2342 with a target of 1.1600 – 1.1489.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
1.2342 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 1.2500 –
1.2600.

 **Analysis:** Daily time frame: presumably, the first wave of larger
degree 1 of (3) was formed, and a downside correction is forming as wave
2 of (3). Apparently, wave a of 2 and an ascending wave b of 2 formed on
the H4 time frame. A descending wave c of 2 is starting to develop on
the H1 time frame. If the presumption is correct, the pair will continue
falling to the levels of 1.1600 – 1.1489. The level of 1.2342 is
critical in this scenario. Its breakout will allow the pair to continue
rising to the levels of 1.2500 – 1.2600.
