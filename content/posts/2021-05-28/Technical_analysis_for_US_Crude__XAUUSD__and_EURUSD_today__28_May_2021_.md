Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 28.05.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

Yesterday, oil price achieved two targets at once: the level of 66.21
and the upper Target Zone 67.34 - 66.81.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

Yesterday, oil price achieved two targets at once: the level of 66.21
and the upper Target Zone 67.34 - 66.81. The Target Zone, which serves
as a resistance, has not been broken out, so it is too early to talk
about further growth. If the price closes above level 67.34 at the US
session, then look for purchases up to the Gold Zone 69.73 - 69.46.

Otherwise, the correction may develop. Traders are already testing the
Micro-zone. Holding the level will lead to the update of the high, a
breakout will lead to reaching the Additional Zone 66.00 - 65.87.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

  1. Buy according to the pattern in Micro-zone 66.65 - 66.60. TakeProfit: 67.27. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. Buy according to the pattern in Additional Zone 66.00 - 65.87. TakeProfit: 67.20. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

Gold went into correction and is now testing the short-term uptrend's
key support 1890 - 1888. First of all, I suggest looking for purchases
according to the pattern with the target at level 1909.

If the Intermediary Zone is broken out, the trend will reverse down. In
this case, sell gold down to the lower Target Zone 1867 - 1863.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

Buy according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 1890 - 1888.
TakeProfit: 1909. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

Euro is testing the border of the short-term uptrend 1.2178 - 1.2169.
While the zone is being held, look for purchases according to the
pattern. The target is level 1.2260. To form a pattern, a breakout of
yesterday's high is required.

If the Intermediary Zone is broken out and the price closes below at the
US session, start selling the euro. The target for sales will be the
lower Target Zone 1.2090 - 1.2072.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

Buy according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 1.2178 - 1.2169.
TakeProfit: 1.2260. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.
