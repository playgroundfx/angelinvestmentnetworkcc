GBPUSD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 28.05.21 – 04.06.21Alex
Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 1.4237 with a target of 1.3660 – 1.3572.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
1.4237 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 1.4450 –
1.4700.

 **Analysis:** Daily time frame: presumably, the first wave of larger
degree (1) finished developing, with wave 5 of (1) formed inside. A
descending correction started developing as wave (2) on the H4 time
frame, with waves A of (2) and B of (2) formed inside. Apparently, wave
С of (2) started developing on the H1 time frame. If this assumption is
correct, the pair will continue to drop to 1.3660 – 1.3572. The level of
1.4237 is critical in this scenario, as the breakout will enable the
pair to continue rising to the levels of 1.4450 – 1.4700.
