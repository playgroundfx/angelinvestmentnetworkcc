NEO Predictions: A Worthwhile Investment?Jana Kane

NEO is a popular [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) project that currently ranks 23rd out of all
cryptocurrencies on [Coinmarketcap][1], making it one of the most
popular altcoins. In this article, we’ll take a closer look at the
short- and long-term NEO price predictions and, in particular, the
predictions for the future. But we’ll also discuss the current NEO coin
rate and the [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) data of the coin.

The article covers the following subjects:

Everyone naturally wants to know what the NEO price will be in the
future. There are many NEO price predictions on the Internet, but which
one should you take seriously? It is best to make your own judgment
about the potential of NEO. You do not have to follow all predictions
indiscriminately. Many of the predictions have been made by people who
benefit from your investment. On this page, you will find the necessary
facts that you can use to answer the question for yourself: "Is NEO a
worthwhile investment?"

## What Is NEO?

NEO, in short, is a [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) project from China founded in 2014. It
used to be called Antshares, but this changed later. [NEO][2] is also
called the Chinese Ethereum because they are strongly committed to
creating a smart economy. This means that the developers of the project
want to make it easy to use [smart contract](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/smart-contract-on-blockchain/)s on the NEO network.

For a trader to use the NEO network, a second cryptocurrency is used -
namely, GAS. This can be considered the fuel of NEO. One share of NEO is
also seen as one share in the network, and the GAS cryptocurrency is
used to make transactions on this network.

By saving your NEO in official wallets, it is possible to earn GAS with
your NEO. This is due to the proof of stake principle. You simply
deposit your NEO coins in your wallet and receive a portion of the GAS
spent on the network in proportion to the amount of NEO you own. It is
thus possible to generate some kind of passive income for yourself. You
can imagine that when the NEO price or the GAS price rises, you will
benefit from the price difference on your NEO but also that of your
obtained extra GAS.

This is one of the reasons people invest or have invested a lot in NEO
in the past. Over the years, as with any project, a lot has happened
with the NEO trend. We should add that it’s not possible to mine NEO
coins because they were all distributed during the ICO.

## NEO in 2020: Some History

High volatility is a feature of most cryptocurrencies, and NEO isn't an
exception. Some [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) data will help you build NEO projected
values.

In 2020 NEO was below $10 at the beginning of the year and touched the
lowest point of the year of $4 on March 13 (at Bitfinex exchange). Yet,
the NEO value managed to jump to $25.90 by September 18. At the end of
the year, the NEO/USD pair settled near $14.

It's well-known that small cryptos copy movements of BTC/USD. Thus, most
of the ups and downs of the NEO/USD pair just repeated Bitcoin's trends.
For instance, the coronavirus hit financial markets in March 2020 the
most, resulting in downtrends in the crypto world, pushing Bitcoin and
NEO down.

Still, some events caused divergence in the direction of prices. At the
end of July, NEO partnered with the Blockchain-based Services Network.
BSN is a global infrastructure that offers a cheap platform for
[blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) projects and similar companies, creating a digital economy.
This event pushed the NEO rate up. You can see how NEO coin [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) can
affect the price of the cryptocurrency.

The last NEO all-time high price was [196.85][3] USD on January 15,
2018, it is much higher than in 2020. A strong bullish trend that began
after the June 2017 rebranding pushed NEO price to its all-time high.
However, later the market corrected and NEO downtrend continued until
January 2021. The NEO/USD today’s rate is: $32.49

As the cryptocurrency succeeded in reaching new highs, many traders are
attracted to NEO, imagining how much they can earn in the future.

### NEO 3.0 Release and How It Can Affect NEO's Price

The NEO team was working on the project for three years. The Crypto
world has been waiting for the NEO 3.0 release since the end of 2020.
The launch was postponed several times. However, in March 2021, Neo
started rolling out an N3 version of its public [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/)
infrastructure.

NEO 3.0 Preview. NEO tries to attract developers to create decentralized
applications on the [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/). The improved consensus protocol can be
used worldwide. The upgrade of the system occurs when the Ethereum
network (a major competitor of NEO) is suffering capacity problems.
Moreover, China, famous for its strict crypto [regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/), claimed
[blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) as a strategically leading technology.

The key points of the N3:

  * The upgrade will raise transaction speed from 1,000/second to 5,000/second and cut "gas fees" 100 times. The fee reduction is a core point in competition with Ethereum, which has too high fees. 

  * A new version will include a decentralized file storage solution and a new [governance mechanism][4]. Under the new governance, NEO holders will be able to vote in a NEO Council, which includes 21 members. The Council will control the management of fees, network upgrades, and other operation-based cases.

  * N3 can become a good place to create non-fungible tokens. 

[Poly Network][5], a consortium interoperability protocol, is used to
facilitate NEO token migration to the new network. The migration with
Poly Network will show whether the network works well to create a
[blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) from scratch and transfer all the data from the existing
chain without errors.

Here are some of the major elements of the NEO 3.0 network that are
supposed to attract developers to the system: multi-language support,
native oracles that secure access to any off-chain data, advanced
interoperability, decentralized storage, and self-sovereign identity,
best-in-class tooling, and a dual-token model.

In the middle of April 2021, after NEO 3.0 started rolling out, the
NEO/USD pair managed to hit $130. It's a significant rise from 0.0320
USD during the ICO in August 2017.

Analysts and crypto enthusiasts believe that it's not the limit and that
further development will lead to higher prices.

## NEO Price Prediction for 2021 by Crypto Experts

NEO, thanks to its great potential, is a better long-term investment
than many other cryptocurrencies. A release of N3 is a springboard for
the NEO price. Let's get a foretaste of the NEO future value by looking
at the predictions given by famous crypto traders and reputable
publications.

Wallet Investor believes that, during 2021, the maximum rate of the
NEO/USD pair won't be able to touch 130 USD again. After hitting $150 in
May, the price will move down, fluctuating within a $62-120 range. Only
in December 2021, the price will jump to 129.5 US dollars.

This famous forecasting agency predicts an uptrend for NEO from August
2021. The highest rate may reach $184 in October; the lowest price of
$110 is still not far from the current rate. Until August, the price
will move within the $72-146 range.

CryptoGround platform forecasts the NEO will experience an uptrend,
although it won't be significant. In June, the price is expected to stay
near $105.78; by November, it will surge to $120.26. At the end of the
year, the NEO coin may rise to $124.6.

The [website](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/website-for-forex-trading/) sees NEO targeting 150 USD shortly. However, after bulls
take profit, there can be a decline to $55.

By the end of the first half of the year, the NEO price is expected to
be at $81.801. The maximum price in June may reach $102.252; the minimum
rate will be set at $69.531. In the second half of 2021, the NEO/USD
rate won't climb above $110. The minimum price will stay above $70.

Coin Price Forecast [website](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/website-for-forex-trading/) has predicted a continuation of the started
uptrend. By July 2021, the price may reach $208. At the end of the year,
$478 may become the next threshold.

## NEO Technical Analysis

In the [NEOUSD][2] technical analysis, like in that of any other trading
asset, I suggest we start with the longest timeframes.

The above chart displays the NEOUSD monthly timeframe. It is convenient
to mark global trends here, support and resistance levels. First, we
should identify the current trend.

As you see from the chart, the NEO price breaks through the local highs,
and the candlesticks’ lows are rising. There is a clear bullish trend.

Blue dots in the chart mark the peaks of trading volumes in 2019 and
2020. Opposite, there are Japanese candlesticks, which we should analyze
to identify closing levels, lows, and highs. These figures will define
the key support and resistance levels.

Let us start the analysis with the latest point in July 2019. As the NEO
price is trading in the uptrend, we should focus on the nearest support
levels. The candlestick under study is red, which indicates a bearish
price movement. We should also note the candlestick close and low. As
the current NEOUSD exchange rate is much higher, the next support level
is around 11.63.

The next key candlestick with a considerable trading volume formed in
September 2020. It is clear from the chart that its high at 25.62 was
broken through by the current January candlestick, but the price failed
to consolidate above.

The most recent January candlestick is green; its body covers the
candlestick bodies over the previous four months. Therefore, the NEO
bullish price movement is likely to continue.

### NEO price prediction for three months

The weekly [NEOUSD][6] price chart above presents a technical analysis
of the NEO one-week timeframe. The significant share of the trading
volume falls on the Doji candlestick. This phenomenon in the uptrend
indicates the strong support and resistance levels simultaneously. The
MACD bearish divergence shows the sellers’ strength. Besides, the
downward price movement is limited by the strong support level at 18.58
from the level of the September candlestick close.

Therefore, the most likely scenario is trading flat in the range of 18 –
28. The price is likely to retest the support level at 20 USD. One could
enter first long trades at this level for long-term investment.

However, if you look at the NEOUSD [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) data, you will see a
similar fractal with a rise of two tops and a deep correction between
the peaks. Therefore, such a scenario might repeat in February.

Spare at least 2/3 of the balance to average the position at about 15
USD. This level marks the trendline and strong support from market
makers. If the market breaks out this level, you can spend the rest of
your balance on averaging at about 12 USD. You should close the buy
position if the NEO price moves below 11.63 USD.

### NEO price forecast for 2021

Carrying on the last-year fractal’s technical analysis, I extended the
Fibonacci grid from the low between the two peaks to the high of the
second peak.

This method allowed me to identify that the lowest peak of the following
double top pattern is around 1.8.

Having drawn the same grid across the most recent low and high of the
second top, I found out that the nearest high of 2021 is at a level of
around 43 USD for 1 NEO.

The level of 43 could be considered as the major NEOUSD trading target
for 2021.

Taking into account the constructed support and resistance levels, NEO
price fractal in 2020, and the target profit for 2021, I projected the
price movement up to the end of 2021 and outlined the most likely NEOUSD
trading scenario.

Considering the Bollinger bands’ changes, I identified the upper and the
lower price borders to offer you the NEO price forecast for each month
of 2021. The aggregated data are in the table below.

Month| NEOUSD price  
---|---  
Low| High  
June 2021| 17.5| 21.44  
July 2021| 17.6| 21.5  
August 2021| 19.3| 28.8  
September 2021| 22.4| 34  
October 2021| 27.7| 40.3  
November 2021| 34.7| 45.4  
December 2021| 33.7| 42.26  
  
 _The NEOUSD price technical analysis is presented by[Mikhail
Hypov][7]._

## Weekly Elliott wave NEO analysis as of 28.06.2021

The NEOUSD is forming a corrective pattern as a double zigzag
(W)-(X)-(Y). So far, there has finished the motive wave (W). Linking
wave (X) is currently unfolding as a zigzag composed of sub-waves W-X-Y,
where wave W is a triple zigzag, wave X is a simple zigzag. Wave Y has
just started developing, and it might be a double zigzag [W]-[X]-[Y].
Let study the first motive wave [W] in more detail in the eight-hour
timeframe.

Wave [W] must be developing as a simple bearish zigzag (A)-(B)-(C). The
market could soon complete the first part of this zigzag, wave (A). Wave
(A) is an impulse composed of sub-waves 1-2-3-4-5. The final wave 5
should end at a level of 25.70. Next, the price should start growing in
the corrective wave (B) towards a level of 69.40. At this level, wave
(B) will be 38.2% of wave (A). One could enter sell trades under the
current conditions with a target at level 25.70.

### Weekly [NEOUSD][2] trading plan:

Sell 29.83, TP 25.70

## NEO Price Prediction for 2022 by Crypto Experts

2022 is close. Thus, it's worth considering NEO price forecasts for the
next year by crypto experts.

During the first four months of the year, the NEO/USD rate may jump to
$160; the minimum price won't fall below $89. Since May 2022, the bulls'
strength may weaken. However, the minimum rate won't be below $80. By
the end of 2022, the maximum price will overcome $160.

According to the Economy Forecast Agency’s [website](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/website-for-forex-trading/), NEO’s price will
fluctuate within the $119-227 range. The uptrend will strengthen since
July.

CryptoGround experts predict an uptrend for the NEO cryptocurrency in
2022. By the end of the year, the NEO/USD exchange rate may reach
$176.66.

TradingBeasts provides one of the most pessimistic forecasts for NEO.
The cryptocurrency's average price will stay within $89-105.80, which is
lower than the current price of $109 (at the time of writing on May 5,
2021). The highest price may reach $132 in December.

DigitalCoin, like most of the other forecast platforms, believes in the
upward movement of the NEO/USD price. During the year, the average price
won't move below $180. NEO/USD may even hit $200.

Coin Price Forecast expects the exchange rate to jump to $574 by July
2022. Although the [website](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/website-for-forex-trading/) predicts a downward movement in the second
half of the year, the price will still be high - $555.

## Long Term NEO Price Prediction for 2025-2030 by Crypto Experts

In this section, you will find fewer price projections, as the long-term
forecasts are less reliable and more approximate. Many factors affect
the cryptocurrency rate. That's why it's so hard to build accurate
predictions.

DigitalCoin [website](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/website-for-forex-trading/) is optimistic about the long-term price direction.
The average price will start the considering period at $320.45, coming
to 2029 at $492.76. However, the platform doesn't provide projections
for 2029 and 2030.

The Economy Forecast Agency can submit only a partial forecast for 2025.
Until May 2025, the price will suffer, trading in the range of $61-95.
The situation will improve in May-June. In June, the highest rate may
skyrocket to $142.

According to the CryptoGround [website](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/website-for-forex-trading/), the price will keep rising.
Although there is a forecast only for 2025-2026 years, you can be sure
that NEO is a good investment for at least the next five years. In 2025,
the average price will stay at $241.44; in 2026, it will move up to
$275.83.

Wallet Investor platform is not ready to provide a forecast for
2027-2030. Still, it has some projections for you. By the end of 2025,
the price may overcome $300. At the same time, the minimum price since
June is always below $100, which is a sign of high volatility.

The forecasts for 2026 finish in May. Still, based on this information,
we can say the uptrend will continue. The highest price will hold above
$300. The lowest price won't decline below $80. Again a big price
difference is a signal of big market fluctuations.

Unlike other analysts and crypto experts, the Coin Price Forecast
platform sees the NEO/USD price above $1000 in the next ten years.

## How Did the Price of NEO Change Over Time?

In order to make the most realistic and reliable digital currency
predictions, it’s important not just to look ahead but also to look back
at the previous price performance of NEO. Below you can see how the NEO
price changed from 2017 to 2020:

 _Source: Coinmarketcap_

## Is NEO a Good Investment?

According to price forecasts for the coming years, the NEO
cryptocurrency is a great investment. Although most of the predictions
don't see the coin above $1,000 within ten years, there may be a sharp
uptrend for years.

If the NEO 3.0 upgrade succeeds and attracts more [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s, winning a
competition with the Ethereum network, the forecasts will be reviewed to
higher levels.

### GAS Dividend From Your NEO

The more NEO you own, the more GAS you will receive. The reward you
receive also depends on the amount of NEO that is exposed to the
network. "Low" NEO prices mean you can buy more of it, and more NEO =
more GAS.

5 GAS tokens are created every block and shared between three parts. 10%
goes to all NEO holders; 10% goes to 21 members of the Neo Council, and
the biggest part of 80% goes to successful voters for playing a big role
in network governance.

0.00000001 is the minimum unit of GAS. To claim GAS tokens, you are not
required to stake NEO. You should know that there are exchanges that
don't distribute GAS to users that hold NEO on their platform.

Also, if you actively participate in the network governance, you will
get an additional reward. Be sure a wallet you choose supports voting.

Let's imagine you invested $10,000 to buy 90 NEO. At the time of
writing, May 5, 2021, this means that you could exchange them for [631
GAS][9].

A user with 90 NEO would receive up to [0.08 GAS per month for holding
NEO plus 3.15 GAS per month][10] for governance participation. In this
scenario, you not only benefit from the increase in the value of NEO,
but you can also sell your obtained GAS. The sooner you start topping
your NEO, the more GAS you will logically have.

The prices are relatively low compared to the [all-time][11] high
($97.49 on January 15, 2018). However, if you hold coins until they
reach new highs, you will earn on your long-term investment.

No one saw it coming when NEO's massive price rose to well over $190. The same may well be the case for the subsequent decline from the [all-time high][3] ($196.85 on January 15, 2018). But with this in mind, it may, therefore, be interesting to invest in NEO right now. Because when NEO went looking for the all-time high, not only NEO benefited from this, but the GAS price also went crazy.

The GAS price at the same time was around $100, while the current GAS
price (May 5, 2021) is fluctuating around 16 USD. The GAS coin price can
be found below:

Source: Coinmarketcap

## Conclusion

Based on the averages of [algorithms](https://www.fintechee.com/algorithms-for-trading/) and expert opinions, the price of
one NEO coin will be above $500 in 1 year, which is roughly 4x higher
than the current NEO price. This makes NEO a worthwhile long-term
investment. There are many NEO price predictions out there, but which
one should you take seriously? It is best to make your own projection
about the potential of NEO. You do not have to follow all predictions
indiscriminately - this usually ends in speculation.
