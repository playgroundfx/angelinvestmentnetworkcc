Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 28.06.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

The short-term oil trend is up. The growth target is the Gold Zone 75.03
- 74.76.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

The short-term oil trend is up. The growth target is the Gold Zone 75.03
- 74.76. Last week's local high was updated today, so the support zones
need to be rearranged.

Look for new purchases according to the patterns at the Micro-zone 73.49
- 73.42 and the Additional Zone 72.83 - 72.70. The level of 74.01 will
serve as an intermediary target.

Oil sales are not possible at the moment, because the short-term trend's
border is far from the current price, namely at the level of 72.45.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

  1. Buy according to the pattern in Micro-zone 73.49 - 73.42. TakeProfit: 74.01. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. Buy according to the pattern in Additional Zone 72.83 - 72.70. TakeProfit: 74.01. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

Gold traders were unable to break out the support level of 1774 today.
As a result, the price rose and again tests the Intermediary Zone of
1785-1783. The accumulation zone between the levels of 1794 and 1774 is
clearly visible. I recommend entering trades at the beforementioned
trading range's borders with a priority for sale since the short-term
trend is down.

If level 1774 is broken out, the June low in the zone of level 1762 will
be updated.

The trend will reverse up if the level of 1794 is broken out. In this
case, the upper Target Zone 1810 - 1805 will be reached.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

Open sell positions according to the pattern in 1794 - 1783. TakeProfit:
1762. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

A short-term euro uptrend with the target at the Target Zone 1.2041 -
1.2023 continues. On Friday last week, the purchase in the Additional
Zone 1.1926 - 1.1921 yielded profits. As a result, the price reached
level 1.1968. Then the price corrected again to the new Additional Zone
1.1931 - 1.1926.

The new Additional Zone together with level 1.1921 form a single support
zone. It will be profitable to look for purchases with a target at level
1.1973 in the beforementioned support.

In case of breaking out the level of 1.1921, the short-term trend will
reverse down. In this case, sell the euro with the target in the
Intermediary Zone 1.1887 - 1.1878.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

Open buy positions according to the pattern in 1.1931 - 1.1921.
TakeProfit: 1.1973. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.
