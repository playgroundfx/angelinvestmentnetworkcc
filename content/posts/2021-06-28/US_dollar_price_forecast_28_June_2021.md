Dollar: Nothing lasts longer than the temporary. Forecast as of
28.06.2021Dmitri Demidenko

Some FOMC members have already changed their views on the temporary
nature of the US inflation surge. However, the leaders, including Jerome
Powell, stick to the old mantra. How will the contradictions within the
Fed affect the euro? Let us discuss the Forex outlook and make up a
[EURUSD][1] trading plan.

## Weekly US dollar fundamental forecast

The USA has not lost its exclusivity. Yes, according to Christine
Lagarde, the euro-area economy is growing faster than expected and will
recover to its pre-pandemic levels by the first quarter of 2022, and not
by the second, as the ECB previously expected. However, the euro-area
inflation is far below the US peer. The rise in the US PCE by 3.9% in
May proved this. But it is not the acceleration of inflation that is
fundamentally important for the US dollar and other currencies. What
matters is how the Fed estimates the situation. The change in the Fed’s
stance is an important driver for the [EURUSD][2].

Before the June FOMC meeting, the markets were confident that the
majority of the committee members firmly believed in the mantra about
the temporary nature of consumer price acceleration. Few expected the
Fed to grow hawkish, which was reflected in the federal funds rate
projections. In fact, the hawks are not that few. Eric Rosengren joined
James Bullard, Robert Kaplan, and Raphael Bostic, talking about the
possibility of tightening monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) at the end of 2022. According
to the President of Boston Fed, the US economy will feature full
employment and sustained inflation of 2% or more already at the end of
next year.

In my opinion, the core around Jerome Powell is gradually turning from
dovish to neutral, and the number of hawks is increasing, which
increases the risks of earlier normalization of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) than is
currently expected. At the same time, the derivatives market, as usual,
predicts a more aggressive increase in the federal funds rate than the
FOMC.

### Interest rate forecasts of FOMC and derivatives market

According to St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, a federal funds rate
hike in 2022 requires 2-year inflation to exceed 2.5%. The personal
consumption expenditure index in May was 2.2% higher than in 2019.
Analysts of BofA Merrill Lynch do not understand at all why the surge in
consumer prices should be temporary if the underlying factors, including
fiscal and monetary stimuli, prices for raw materials, real estate, and
other assets are permanent. BofA Merrill Lynch predicts a rise in the US
inflation of 2%-4% over the next 4 years (!) and stresses the fact that
over the last century it averaged 3%, in the 2010s - 2%, in 2020 - 1%,
but in 2021, inflation has already grown by 8% on an annual basis.

Unless the CPI and PCE acceleration turns out to be a temporary
phenomenon, it will raise inflation expectations and force the Fed to
act much more aggressively than [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s currently assume. Furthermore,
the faster US employment will recover, the closer the US economy will be
to full employment; that is, the second condition for the federal funds
rate hike will be fulfilled.

### Weekly [EURUSD][2] trading plan

I won’t be surprised if the expectations of growth of non-farm payrolls
by 685,000 ~~7~~ 00,000 in June will send the [EURUSD][2] down, followed
by a price rise on the factual data. It will be relevant to sell if the
price breaks out the support at 1.1915. Otherwise, its consolidation
ahead of an important event will increase the risks of a sharp price
change at the time of the release of significant US employment data.
