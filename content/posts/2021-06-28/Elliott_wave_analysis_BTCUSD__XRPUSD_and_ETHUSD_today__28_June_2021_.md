Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 28.06.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

All three cryptocurrency pairs covered in the article should be
declining in bearish impulses. Let us study each pair in detail.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

The BTCUSD market is likely to continue forming the down impulse wave
[A], which starts a large zigzag. In the middle of this month,
corrective wave (4) finished as a complex formation. Next, the price
started moving down in the impulse wave (5). Wave 4, unfolding as a
flat, should finish at a level of around 35500.00, the previous high.
After that, the market will resume falling in wave 5 to a level of
28750.00, the previous low.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Sell 35500.00, TP 28750.00

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

The XRPUSD market is forming the down impulse wave C, which should
conclude the global bearish zigzag. Impulse C is composed of five sub-
waves [1]-[2]-[3]-[4]-[5]. The zigzag-shaped correction [4] completed in
early June, and the market started declining in the final impulse wave
[5]. There should be developing the final leg of the wave [5]. The
Ripple price should be falling in impulse [5] of a smaller degree to a
level of 0.500.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] **** today:

Sell 0.636, TP 0.500

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

The ETHUSD, like the BTCUSD, is forming the down impulse wave A, which
begins a large bearish zigzag. In early June, the market finished rising
in the zigzag-shaped correction [4]. Next, the price started declining
in the down impulse wave [5]. In wave [5], the sideways correction (4)
has completed as a double three W-X-Y. Therefore, the Ethereum price
should be declining in wave (5) to a level of 1700.00.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Sell 1970.12, TP 1700.00
