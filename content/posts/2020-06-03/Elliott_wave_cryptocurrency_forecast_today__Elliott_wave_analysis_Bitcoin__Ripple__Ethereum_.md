There is now forming the impulse wave [5] that is the final impulse in
the A impulse of a larger degree. The sub-waves (1)-(2)-(3) are likely
to have completed, and there is now developing the down corrective wave
(4) that should complete as a simple zigzag composed of the sub-waves
A-B-C. After correction (4) completes, the price should start rising in
wave (5) to a level of 11000, as it is outlined in the chart.

The chart displays the corrective wave (B) that is composed of the sub-

as a double zigzag [W]-[X]-[Y]. There is likely to be unfolding an
inceptive phase of the bearish zigzag Y. The price should be declining
to a level of 0.176, this is the previous low made by wave W. An
