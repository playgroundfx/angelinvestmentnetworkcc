Economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the week 03.05.2021 – 09.05.2021Jana Kane

##  **Review of the main events of the Forex economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the
next trading week (03.05.2021 – 09.05.2021)**

 **Trading on key Forex [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/): next week we expect the publication of
important macro statistics from Germany, the US, Australia, New Zealand,
Canada, Eurozone, China, as well as the results of the meeting of the
UK's Central Bank.**

The dollar strengthened last week, and the DXY dollar index ended it in
the positive territory after falling in the previous three weeks.

Dollar quotes rose despite the results of the Fed meeting, which ended
last Wednesday. As a result, the central bank leaders retained the
parameters of the current monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), and the head of the Federal
Reserve Jerome Powell once again tried to calm the markets, saying that
the central bank will not soon switch to a tighter monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).
Powell said last Wednesday that the Fed will not change rates until the
labor market regains its former strength and inflation reaches the 2%
target.

The resumed growth in the yield of US government bonds and positive
macro statistics from the United States last week, which indicated that
the US economy continues to confidently recover from the crisis caused
by the coronavirus, also helped the dollar to rise. Thus, the US GDP
dynamics index indicated that the country's economy in the 1st quarter
of 2021 grew by 6.4%, which is higher than the forecast of 6.1% and the
previous value of 4.3%.

Next week, financial market participants will pay attention to the
publication of important macro statistics from Germany, the US,
Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Eurozone, and China, including the
publication on Friday of monthly data from the US labor market, which
are crucial (along with inflation and GDP data) for the Fed in making
decisions on monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), as well as the speech of the Fed Chairman
Jerome Powell and the results of the UK's central bank meeting.

 **Traders should pay attention to the publication of the following
macro indicators:**

 ***during the coming week, new events may be added to the [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) and
/ or some scheduled events may be canceled**

 ****GMT time**

###  **Monday, May 3**

###  **06:00** **EUR Retail sales in Germany**

Retail sales is the main indicator of consumer spending in Germany
showing changes in retail sales. A high result strengthens the euro, and
vice versa, a low result weakens it. Forecast: +3.0% (-3.1% in annual
[terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) in March against +1.2% (-9.0% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) in February, -4.5%
(-8.7% in in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) in January, -9.6% (+1.5% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) in
December, +1.9% (+5.6% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) in November.

The data indicate a new decline in the indicator (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) due
to new lockdowns. The data release is unlikely to have a positive impact
on the euro. Better-than-expected data is likely to have a positive
effect on the euro, but only in the short term.

###  **14:00** **USD Manufacturing** **PMI (from ISM)**

Published by the Institute for Supply Management (ISM), the US
Manufacturing PMI is an important indicator of the health of the US
economy as a whole. A result above 50 is seen as positive and
strengthens the USD, one below 50 as negative for the US dollar.
Forecast: 65.0 in April (against 64.7 in March, 60.8 in February, 58.7
in January, 60.7 in December). The index value is above the 50 level and
previous values, which is likely to support the dollar. The data above
the value of 50 indicates an acceleration of activity, which has a
positive effect on the quotes of the national currency. If the indicator
falls below the forecast and especially below the value of 50, the
dollar may weaken sharply.

###  **18:20 USD Speech by the Fed Chairman Jerome Powell**

Powell's comments could have an impact on both short-term and long-term
USD trading if he revisits the Fed's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). A more hawkish
stance on the Fed's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) is seen as positive and
strengthening the US dollar, while a more cautious position is seen as
negative for the USD. If he makes unexpected statements, the volatility
in the financial markets may increase.

###  **Tuesday, May 4**

###  **01:30 AUD Balance of trade**

This indicator assesses the ratio of the volumes of exports and imports
of Australia. Growth in exports from Australia leads to an increase in
the trade surplus, which has a positive impact on the AUD. Previous
value (for February): A$ 7.529 billion. A decrease in the trade surplus
may negatively affect the Australian dollar. Conversely, the growing
trade surplus is a positive factor for the AUD.

###  **04:30 AUD RBA's decision on interest rate. RBA's accompanying
statement**

In March 2020, the RBA made 2 rate cuts, bringing it to the level of
0.25%, and launched a quantitative easing program. At the same time, for
the 3-year government bonds of Australia, the target level of yield is
set at 0.25%. The RBA has launched a lending program for the banking
system in the amount of at least A$ 90 billion.

In early November 2020, the RB of Australia lowered its key rate again,
bringing it and its 3-year bond target to 0.10% from 0.25%, and
announced a A$ 100 billion quantitative easing program to support the
economic recovery.

“We live in extraordinary and difficult times,” said central bank
governor Philip Lowe. In his opinion, "further stimulation is needed."
He stated this during a press conference on March 19, 2020, when the RBA
lowered the interest rate during its unscheduled meeting.

The main negative factors for the Australian economy are weak wages
growth, a weak labor market and a slowdown in growth. Annual inflation
has remained below the RBA's target range of 2-3% for four years.

Unemployment in the country has remained above the 5% level for many
years, unwilling to decline. Now the Australian economy is experiencing
difficulties due to the coronavirus pandemic, which has hit the tourism
and transport sectors.

It is expected that at this meeting the Central Bank of Australia will
leave the rate at the current level of 0.1%, although unexpected
decisions are not ruled out.

In an accompanying statement, the leaders of the RBA will explain the
reasons for the decision on the rate. If the RBA signals the possibility
of further easing of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) in the near future, the risks of a
further fall in the Australian dollar will increase.

###  **22:45 NZD Employment rate. Unemployment rate (1st quarter)**

The employment rate reflects the quarterly change in the number of New
Zealand citizens employed. The growth of the indicator has a positive
impact on consumer spending, which stimulates economic growth. A high
reading is positive for the NZD, while a low reading is negative.
Forecast: in the 1st quarter, the number of employed citizens of New
Zealand increased, and the employment rate increased by +0.1% (against
an increase of +0.6% in the 4th quarter of 2020, a fall of -0.8% in 3
Q1, +0.7% growth in Q1 2020 and -0.4% decline in Q2).

Also at the same time, the Bureau of Statistics of New Zealand publishes
a report on the unemployment rate - an indicator that assesses the ratio
of the unemployed population to the total number of able-bodied
citizens. The growth of the indicator indicates the weakness of the
labor market, which leads to a weakening of the national economy. The
decline in the indicator is a positive factor for the NZD. Forecast:
unemployment in New Zealand in the 1st quarter remained at the same
level of 4.9% (against 4.9% in the 4th quarter of 2020, 5.3% in the 3rd
quarter, 4.0% in the 2nd m quarter, 4.2% in the first quarter of 2020).

If other indicators of the NZ Bureau of Statistics report deteriorate,
it is likely to negatively affect the NZD. Poor forecast data will have
an even stronger negative impact on the NZD.

###  **23:00 NZD Speech by the head of the RBNZ Adrian Orr**

Speeches by the head of the RBNZ often serve as an unofficial source of
information on the future direction of the central bank's monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). It is likely that the head of the RBNZ will reaffirm the bank's
propensity to pursue a soft monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), which will lead to
continued pressure on the New Zealand currency.

###  **Wednesday, May 5**

###  **12:15 USD ADP National Employment Report** ****

Typically, ADP's private sector employment report has a strong impact on
the market and dollar quotes. An increase in the value of this indicator
has a positive effect on the dollar. The growth in the number of workers
in the US private sector in April is expected to be +808,000 (against an
increase of 517,000 in March, 117,000 in February, 174,000 in January, a
fall of -123,000 in December). The relative growth of the indicator may
have a positive effect on the dollar quotes, while the relative decline
in the indicator - negatively. Therefore, the market reaction may be
negative, and the dollar may decline if the data turns out to be worse
than forecast and especially against the previous value.

Millions of Americans have previously been laid off due to the
coronavirus pandemic and related quarantine measures. The bulk of
layoffs were concentrated in tourism and retail. Other important sectors
of the economy were also affected. ADP previously reported that the most
significant drop in employment was recently observed in the construction
and financial services sectors.

Although the ADP report does not directly correlate with the official US
Labor Department data, which will be released on Friday, the ADP report
is often a harbinger of it with a noticeable impact on the market.

###  **14:00 USD Services** **PMI (from ISM)**

This indicator assesses the state of the services sector in the US
economy. These services sectors (as opposed to the manufacturing sector)
have practically no impact on the country's GDP.

In January this indicator came out with a value of 58.7, and in March -
63.7. A result above 50 is seen as positive for the USD. However, a
relative decline in the index could negatively affect the dollar in the
short term. Forecast for April: 64.3, which is likely to have a positive
overall effect on the USD.

###  **23:50 JPY Bank of Japan's Monetary Policy Committee Meeting**

At this meeting, the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Japan will
once again sum up the results of the bank's regular meeting last week,
analyze the economic situation in Japan and give indications on possible
future prospects for the Bank of Japan's financial [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).

If the tone of the minutes of the meeting indicates the firmness of the
intentions of the Bank of Japan regarding monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) in the
country, it will negatively affect the Japanese stock market and
strengthen the yen. Conversely, mild rhetoric about the bank's monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) prospects will contribute to the weakening of the yen and the
growth of the Japanese stock market.

###  **Thursday, May 6**

###  **09:00 EUR Retail sales in the Eurozone**

Retail sales is a major consumer spending indicator that shows the
change in retail sales. A high result strengthens the euro, and vice
versa, a low result weakens it. Forecast for March: +1.4% and +9.4% (in
annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) against +3.0% and -2.9% (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) in February
-5.9% and -6.4% (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) in January. The data suggests that,
despite the rise in indices, retail sales have not yet reached pre-
coronavirus levels after a sharp drop in March-April 2020, when strict
quarantine measures were in force in Europe. Thus, the publication of
the data with the indicated values ​​is unlikely to provide the euro
with significant support if they do not turn out to be better than the
forecast.

###  **11:00 GBP Bank of England's interest rate decision. Minutes of
the meeting of the Bank of England. Planned volume of asset purchases by
the Bank of England. Monetary Policy Report**

In March (11 March and 19 March) 2020, during its extraordinary
meetings, the Bank of England cut its interest rate twice, bringing it
to the level of 0.1%, and announced its intention to purchase UK
government bonds in the amount of 200 billion British pounds, trying to
counteract economic damage from the coronavirus pandemic. The central
bank announced an increase in its bond portfolio to £645bn, then to
£745bn and to £895bn from £445bn at the time. "The current situation is
completely unprecedented," said Governor of the Bank of England Andrew
Bailey during a press conference after an emergency meeting on March 19.
Bailey said he expected a sharp economic contraction due to the
coronavirus, and the Bank of England was ready to take further stimulus
measures if necessary. “No, we are not done yet,” he said. Based on
these statements by Andrew Bailey, it is fair to expect further actions
from the Bank of England towards easing its monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). It is
possible that at this meeting on May 6, the Bank of England will again
undertake them, increasing the volume of purchases of bonds or lowering
the interest rate. Although, most economists believe that the Bank of
England will refrain from these actions for now.

Also at this time, the minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of
the Bank of England are published with the distribution of votes "for"
and "against" raising / lowering the interest rate. The main risks for
the UK after Brexit are associated with expectations of a slowdown in
the country's economic growth, as well as with a large current account
deficit in the UK balance of payments.

The intrigue about the further actions of the Bank of England remains.
And in the trading of the pound and the FTSE100 index, a lot of trading
opportunities will be there during the period of the publication of the
bank's decision on rates.

Also at the same time, the Bank of England's report on monetary and
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) will be published, containing an assessment of the
economic outlook and inflation. At this time, the volatility in the
pound quotes may rise sharply. Apart from GDP, one of the main
benchmarks for the Bank of England regarding the prospects for monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) in the UK is the inflation rate. If the tone of the report is
soft, the British stock market will receive support and the pound will
decline. Conversely, the tough rhetoric of the report on containing
inflation, which implies an increase in the interest rate in the UK,
will lead to the strengthening of the pound.

###  **11:30 GBP Speech by the head of the Bank of England Andrew
Bailey**

Financial market participants expect Andrew Bailey to clarify the
situation regarding the further [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the UK central bank.
Volatility during the speech of the head of the Bank of England usually
rises sharply in the quotes of the pound and the London Stock Exchange
FTSE index if he gives any hints of tightening or easing of the Bank of
England's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). Probably, Andrew Bailey will also give
explanations regarding the decision made by the Bank of England on the
interest rate and will touch upon the state and prospects of the British
economy after Brexit and the partial lifting of quarantine restrictions
due to the coronavirus. If Bailey does not touch on monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
issues, the reaction to his speech will be weak.

###  **Friday, May 7**

###  **01:30 AUD** RBA's statement on monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)

The Statement on Monetary Policy provides an overview of economic and
financial conditions and an assessment of risks to financial stability
and sustainable economic growth. The statement is a kind of guideline
for determining the RBA's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) plans. A tougher stance on the
RBA's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) is seen as positive and strengthens the Australian
dollar, while a more cautious stance is seen as negative for the AUD.

###  **12:30 USD Average hourly wages. Non-Farm Payrolls. Unemployment
rate**

The most important indicators of the state of the labor market in the
United States in April. Forecast: +0.1% (against -0.1% in March, +0.2%
in January and February, +0.8% in December, +0.3% in November) / +0.950
million (against +0.916 million in March, +0.379 in February, +0.049
million in January, -0.140 million in December, +0.245 million in
November, +0.638 million in October, +1.763 million in July and -20.687
million in April) / 5.7 % (against 6.0% in March, 6.2% in February, 6.3%
in January, 6.7% in December and November, 6.9% in October, 13.3% in May
and 14.7 % in April), respectively.

In general, the indicators can be described as encouraging. The data
speaks of continued improvement in the US labor market after plummeting
in the first half of 2020. Prior to the coronavirus, the US labor market
remained strong, signaling the stability of the American economy and
supporting dollar quotes.

It is often difficult to predict the market reaction to the publication
of indicators, because many indicators for previous periods are subject
to revision. Now it will be even more difficult to do this, because the
economic situation in many other major economies remains controversial
due to the coronavirus. In any case, when data from the US labor market
is published, a surge in volatility is expected in trading not only in
USD, but throughout the entire financial market. The most cautious
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s might choose to stay out of the market during this time frame.

###  **12:30 CAD Unemployment rate in Canada**

Statistics Canada will publish the data on the country's labor market
for April.

Unemployment has risen in Canada in recent months amid massive business
closures due to coronavirus and layoffs. Unemployment rose from the
usual 5.6% - 5.7% to 7.8% in March and to 13.7% in May 2020. If
unemployment continues to rise, the Canadian dollar will decline. If the
data turn out to be better than the previous value, the Canadian dollar
will strengthen. A decrease in the unemployment rate is a positive
factor for the CAD, an increase in unemployment is a negative factor. It
is expected that in April unemployment was at the level of 8% (against
7.5% in March, 8.2% in February, 9.4% in January, 8.8% in December, 8.6%
in November).
