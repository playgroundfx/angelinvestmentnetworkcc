XRP Price Predictions & Ripple forecast: 2021 and BeyondJana Kane

Ripple XRP is one of the world's foremost cryptos - and one of the most
intriguing. Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other big names, it does not
market itself with its decentralization. Instead, the crypto is closely
associated with several banks, investment companies, and organizations
worldwide.

This may seem counterproductive when many traders believe that the
biggest selling point of cryptocurrencies is their freedom of influence
from outside companies. However, crypto experts are increasingly arguing
that it could be the key to Ripple's success.

At the end of 2020, the company faced an SEC lawsuit that put the Ripple
future under threat. Making a Ripple price prediction has become
challenging for experts and common [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s. Why is Ripple going up and
down? How high will Ripple go? Let's find out!

The article covers the following subjects:

## What Is Ripple Crypto and the History of XRP?

Ripple or XRP: are they synonyms or different [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)? If you are new to
the crypto market, you may have such questions in your mind. Thus, we
will start our price guide with basic [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/). It will allow you to
differentiate Ripple's products.

In order for traders to understand Ripple price predictions, it is
important to know what Ripple XRP is and why it differs from most other
cryptos on the market.

Put simply, Ripple is a company that provides a payment protocol that
can be compared to a payment system, money transfer network, and
currency exchange. The protocol works with digital currencies, fiat
money, and commodities. XRP is the protocol's internal coin.

If you want to have a deeper understanding of the Ripple topic, check
the following [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/).

  * XRP or Ripple is a cryptocurrency that’s powered by RippleNet. Financial institutions use the coin to provide fast transactions with low fees. 

  * RippleNet represents a payment platform. It's based on the distributed ledger database of XRP Ledger. Ripple operates the digital platform. RippleNet Cloud is used to deal with payments with one integration and a common Ripple Payment Object among RippleNet’s customers. It allows for “less friction and more standardization when customers are ready to scale.” 

  * As for the XRP Ledger, it's open-source and is based on the ledger database, not [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/).

### About Ripple - A Crash Course on XRP

Ryan Fugger was the first person who announced the idea of Ripple. It
was in 2004. However, the protocol's real [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) started only in 2012
when Jed McCaleb and Chris Larson took over the project. That time it
was not even Ripple but OpenCoin. The platform is actually called
RippleNet, while the crypto token is Ripple XRP. (It is usually listed
as XRP on exchanges).

First, it was a startup project from San Francisco; the [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/)-like
payment system was developed. It was created as an alternative to money
transfers for the banking system, not as an opposition. Its popularity
among financial institutions grew fast, and soon the company announced
interest from leading banks. It was expected as the system enforced low-
fee fast transfers all around the world.

Most altcoins that have entered the market are designed to solve some
problems that the founders believed could ultimately limit the success
of Bitcoin, the so-called king of cryptocurrency. Many, like Bitcoin
Cash, have focused on Bitcoin's lack of scalability. However, Ripple
focused on another feature of crypto: its decentralization.

Rather than providing a way for merchants and [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s to make
transactions online without going through a centralized financial
institution (which can be slow, potentially unsafe, and expensive),
Ripple was designed to make it easier for centralized financial
institutions to make payments. Cross-border payments can be even slower
than domestic payments, and they come with much higher transaction costs
- and companies worldwide can make hundreds of these transactions every
day.

To avoid skyrocketing transaction fees and unfavorable exchange rates,
Ripple allows companies to send and receive payments in Ripple XRP. It
offers a globalized currency that bypasses some of the problems that can
plague fiat currency and fully decentralized cryptos.

Banks apply the protocol to make cross-border transfers in real-time
using the xCurrent software solution. At the same time, Ripple (XRP) is
also available for [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s and traders. Traders can do operations with
the cryptocurrency via trading on crypto exchanges or with the help of
brokers. The company has had [contact](https://www.playgroundfx.com/contact/)s at the [highest political and
financial levels][1] for many years. Think of the World Bank, the ECB,
the IMF, and the World Economic Forum. With rave recommendations and
being priced from all sides – what could go wrong?

## What Happened to XRP in 2020?

Before we list experts' opinions regarding XRP price forecasts and
Ripple's future, let's look at the price [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) that will uncover
plenty of vital things for any [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/). First, you will see what
affects the current price of XRP and in what way. And, you will catch
the current market conditions to be in the market.

During 2020, the [XRP market price][2] was relatively stable with
several medium-term bullish and bearish trends. After the upward
movement at the beginning of the year, the price was declining for a
month, from February to March. The next bullish trend occurred in July
but finished in less than a month. The main rise happened in November
when the price hit a maximum of $0.79.

Why is Ripple going up or down? If you think that something specific is
hidden behind these price movements, it's a mistake. The major Ripple
trends are positively correlated with BTC movements, so even Bitcoin
halving can affect the XRP price. The cryptocurrency repeats the trend
of the primary market.

Still, there were some certain events we should mention. Investors'
sentiments determine the price direction of any asset. Ripple
supply/demand factor plays a huge role. In April 2020, the co-founder of
Ripple Jed McCaleb sold 54 million Ripples. It's not a surprise that the
price moved down after the event became public.

New agreements with leading banks are one of the main drivers of XRP's
price. For example, in August, India's largest bank HDFC Bank Limited
joined RippleNet, in November, the second American largest bank, the
Bank of America, signed an agreement with Ripple.

In December, such leading US exchanges as Coinbase and Binance claimed
support for the upcoming airdrop of Spark tokens by Flare Networks. The
Flare airdrop took place, and 45 billion Spark tokens were distributed
among the XRP holders. The XRP price increased on the [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/); however, it
was corrected shortly.

Such events have short-term market effects that aren’t visible on high
timeframes.

Well, we have come to the most significant event that is still affecting
Ripple. The SEC, the US stock market watchdog, is challenging [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/)
company Ripple Inc. in court, along with its two top figures, CEO Brad
Garlinghouse and founder Christian Larsen. The [regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/)s in the US are
tough. The Securities and Exchange Commission's accusation is that
unregistered securities worth [$1.3 billion were sold in 2013][3]. It is
an old case hanging over Ripple for as long as we can remember. Ripple
has always maintained that the digital currency is a currency instead of
a security. Because otherwise, they'd have to comply with a lot of
different rules according to American law. Many are amazed that the US
apparently wants to slaughter the goose that lays the golden eggs.

In two days, from December 22 to 23, 2020, the XRP rate dropped from
approximately $0.50 to just under $0.30. From third place as the most
important cryptocurrency, the coin moved to fourth place, behind
stablecoin Tether.

It's time to find out what is expected of Ripple in 2021 and beyond.

## XRP Price Prediction for 2021 by Crypto Experts ****

The SEC case hasn't been solved yet. It has a dramatic effect on the XRP
price. Before December 2020, Ripple was considered the third digital
currency by market cap (CoinMarketCap); now, it's in sixth place. Is
Ripple expected to rise? Look at experts' predictions. ****

### #1 TradingBeasts.com

[TradingBeasts.com ][4]expects the [XRP][2] price to be at $0.6585 in
March. The price won't change significantly at the end of the year, but
even a small estimated growth is a good sign for traders. In December
2021, the price will be at $0.6874.

### #2 Wallet Investor

[Wallet Investor][5] sees Ripple suffering during the year. From March
till the end of December, the price won't rise above $0.50. The
downtrend will start from $0.5088 on March 1, 2021, and will end in late
December, when the price will surge above $0.5020 on December 20.

### #3 Crypto Ground

The Ripple forecast of [Crypto Ground][6] can be called the most
bearish. According to the [website](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/website-for-forex-trading/), the XRP will hardly rise above $0.30
within the year. By 2022, the price will reach only $0.3488.

### #4 Ripple Coin News

[Ripple Coin News]7. "It is reasonable that XRP will achieve the $1.00 level by the end of this year."

### #5 Longforecast.com

Below, you can check the Ripple coin price prediction by
[Longforecast.com][8]. The source offers one of the rosiest predictions
for the XRP/USD pair. In March, the price will close at $0.82. Although
XRP will cost only 84 cents in December, during the year, Ripple will
rise above $1.

## Ripple Technical Analysis

Will Ripple Go Up? How High Can Ripple Go? Look at  XRP Technical
Analysis.

We shall start the [XRPUSD][2] technical analysis by exploring the
monthly Ripple price chart outlook. First, we will identify the global
trend and the key levels.

 ****

As you see from the [XRP/USD][9] [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) chart, the price has been
regularly updating local highs and lows since March 2020 (see the
candlesticks above the blue trendline). Despite the powerful impulses
and sell-offs, there is a general global bullish trend.

 ****

Another important marker is surges of trade volumes marked with blue
dots in the prediction chart.

An increase in trader activity in December 2021 resulted in a failed try
to break out at level $0.17. The red candlestick’s low determinesthe
strong support level at 0.17, marked with the red line in the chart.
Note that, starting from the second half of 2019, the XRP/USD quotes
have often approached this line, but it has never consolidated below.
This fact suggests the presence of a powerful buyer in the market,
actively buying out all the orders at this level to push the price up to
the Ripple price target above.

The next, even more significant, trade volume peak points out a powerful
resistance level reached by the January candlestick high (green line).
In September 2018, the price movement already stopped at level 0.75 USD.
This level should attract large sellers, creating selling pressure.

### XRP Price Prediction for the Next Three Months

Let’s go to the technical analysis in the weekly [Ripple chart][2].

 ****

Note that most of the time, the XRP quotes have been moving within a
narrow Bollinger band. So, the price should be swinging in the range of
0.18 USD – 0.50 USD.

 ****

Having explored the[ XRPUSD][2] exchange rate [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) data, I noticed
similar fractals, which could be conventionally divided into three
phases.

  * Red circle – consolidation with strong upward momentum.

  * Blue circle – a sharp correction, following the impulse, going down to the level where the Ripple growth started or lower.

  * Green circle – widening consolidation range with false breakouts of local highs and lows.

As you see from the chart above, this fractal in the bullish trend
features the upward price movement in a broad trading channel. However,
I can state for sure that the[][2]price finished the stage of the blue
circle. Therefore, the market should be trading sideways in the range of
0.23 USD and 0.70 USD over the next three months.

### XRP Forecast for 2021

Having carried out the fractals’ technical analysis in the Ripple
market, I offer the XRP/USD price projection for 2021.

 ****

Taking into account the width of the trading channel and the range of
Bollinger bands, I suggest the[XRPUSD][2] future price movement for
2021. I determined the range of the likely market movement by projecting
the monthly candlestick, highlighted with an orange box in the chart.

In the main, the trading scenario suggests a consolidation in the broad
range between levels 0.29 USD and 0.74 USD until late spring. The rate
is likely to retest the upper and the lower channel borders this year.
When you consider the wave sequence, there should be, first, a peak in
the zone of 0.75 USD – 0.85 USD. Next, the [XRPUSD][2] traders should
try to test the support level in the price range of 0.17 USD – 0.18 USD.

 _The[XRPUSD][2] price technical analysis is presented by [Mikhail
Hypov][10]. _

## Weekly Elliott wave Ripple analysis as of 22.03.2021

The Ripple market is forming the corrective down wave B, which is an
element of the upward simple zigzag A-B-C. This long-term correction is
unfolding as a triple zigzag [W]-[X]-[Y]-[X]-[Z]. The first three parts
of the zigzag have completed. At the time of writing, the market is
following the second linking wave [X], unfolding as a contracting
triangle. Let us study the [X] wave in more detail in the eight-hour
timeframe.

In the triangle pattern, there is developing the corrective down wave
(D). Wave (D) is likely to complete as a simple zigzag A-B-C. The
impulse wave A has completed, driving the price down. Next, a deep
corrective wave B has started unfolding as a double zigzag [W]-[X]-[Y],
which should end soon. In the near future, the price should be rising in
the impulse wave (C), which could conclude the double combination at a
level of about 0.645, where wave [W] completed. One could enter
purchases in the current situation.

### Weekly [XRPUSD][2] trading plan:

Buy 0.513, TP 0.645

## XRP Price Prediction for 2022 by Crypto Experts

At the end of 2020, crypto experts divided into two groups: those who
believed in Ripple’s recovery and those who wished RIP to Ripple. Let’s
see what leading crypto sources say about the Ripple future value.

### #1 TradingBeasts.com

[TradingBeasts.com predicts][4] XRP to fluctuate near $0.70 throughout
2022. At the beginning of the year, the average projected value will be
at $0.6923; in December 2022, it will move up to $0.7630. Not bad,
considering the current situation.

### #2 Wallet Investor

[Wallet Investor][5] has a similar view for the Ripple price forecast in
January 2022. The average open price, as of January 1, 2022, is $0.685.
However, the overall trend will be bearish. Ripple will end the year at
$0.612.

### #3 Crypto Ground

[Crypto Ground][6] disagrees with such a pessimistic forecast. The
source sees the bullish trend in 2022. The price will be able to hit $1
and come to 2023 at $1.0147.

### #4 Changelly

[Changelly][12] platform: “As soon as XRP reaches $1, the correction
phase may enter. The most likely zone for XRP price in 2022 is from $0.5
to $1. However, if the company gains support from the investment giants,
the XRP rate can change its direction to a new bull run.”

### #5 Longforecast.com

[Longforecast.com][8] has a bearish forecast for Ripple in 2022. The
price will decline from $0.97 to $0.59 during the year.

## Ripple Price Prediction for 2023 by Crypto Experts

Moving further, we see that although the price of XRP won’t hit
exclusive highs, the cryptocurrency won’t disappear. What awaits the XRP
coin price in 2023? How much will it cost?

### #1 TradingBeasts.com

[TradingBeasts.com ][4]forecasts the downtrend in 2023 for the XRP
price. In January, XRP/USD will stay at $0.7710. Still, in December, the
XRP will move to $0.6844.

### #2 Wallet Investor

The [Wallet Investor][5] [website](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/website-for-forex-trading/) predicts the worse figures. Until mid-
January 2023, the average price will be slightly above $0.60. Until mid-
December, the price will move down, reaching lows below $0.30. A slight
recovery at the end of the year near $0.50 is possible.

### #3 Crypto Ground

[Crypto Ground][6] is still the most optimistic about the XRP price. The
cryptocurrency is anticipated to stay above $1, reaching $1.3463 by
2024.

### #4 Changelly

[Changelly][12] platform: “XRP price has a strong correlation with the
whole cryptocurrency market. It means that if Bitcoin or altcoins will
grow, then Ripple is likely to reach the previous all-time high point of
$3.84. This is a very optimistic scenario. If the SEC wins the lawsuit,
the XRP price can fall down to a couple of cents.”

### #5 Longforecast.com

[Longforecast.com][8] is bearish about Ripple in 2023. The overall
downward trend will lead the coin below 30 cents at the end of the year.

## Long Term XRP projections: 2025-2030

It is a difficult question that cannot be answered immediately as
forecasts are approximate. You never know what will happen to the price
tomorrow. Is it possible to predict what will be in 5-10 years? It is,
therefore, best to be aware of the latest Ripple [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/). Then you know

Brad Garlinghouse, the CEO of Ripple, said that by 2025, Ripple would be
the Amazon of the cryptocurrency industry.

### #1 Crypto Ground

[Crypto Ground][6] believes the cryptocurrency will climb to $2 in
2025-2026. The primary trend is bullish.

### #2 Wallet Investor

The [Wallet Investor][5] [website](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/website-for-forex-trading/) doesn’t see anything positive for XRP
in 2025. The price will be below $0.20 during the year. However, there
is a chance it will surge to $0.40 at the end of December 2025. As for
the beginning of 2026, the price will fluctuate near $0.20.

### #3 Longforecast.com

[Longforecast.com][8] doesn’t provide such a long-term forecast. There
is only an outlook for three months of 2025 - the price will stay below
$0.30.

### #4 Smartereum

[Smartereum][13] provides one of the least realistic XRP projections. It
predicts Ripple will be able to skyrocket to $200 - $300 by 2030. Yes,
it seems crazy, but the future is unpredictable.

## How Has The Price Of Ripple Changed Over Time?

It’s wrong to check XRP price predictions without looking back at recent
and not-so-recent events. The SEC situation made that even more precise.
The Ripple price today is $0.54515. Looking at the full price chart
below, you can see how the price of XRP changed over the years and where
it stood on the day of writing, February 16, 2021, after the turbulence
it went through with the SEC.

## Is Ripple a Good Investment?

Should I invest in Ripple? Ripple: buy or sell? Maybe these questions
are still in your head. Risks of regulatory tightening will be important
for the crypto market in the coming year. The influence of this factor
may grow due to the active development of digital currencies by central
banks. Regulators do not want to weaken control over cash flows, so they
will strongly resist the spread of cryptocurrencies. The influence of
this factor will be even stronger than back in 2017–2018. The expected
development of DeFi is another risk for Ripple.

Oddly enough, the coronavirus pandemic can support the virtual market.
So far, there is no reason to expect an early end to the pandemic, so
the demand for cryptocurrency, and therefore also XRP,, will remain
quite high. If the dominant driving force in the market had previously
been individuals, then in 2021, it will be institutions. Therefore, next
year we will most likely see a smooth rise in the XRP coin. Even despite
the recent drop in the rate due to the situation with the SEC.
