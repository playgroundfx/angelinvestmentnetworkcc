EUR/USD Forecast: A Weaker Dollar in 2021 Makes SenseJana Kane

Based on the knowledge that [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s have at a given moment, they
always make prices with a certain expectation about the future. For
example, currency rates are the macroeconomic prospects of a country or
region, and the price paid for shares usually implies an expectation
about future earnings and sales development.

Professional market parties closely follow the financial [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) and
continuously process new information, including economic forecasts and
other expectations. Based on this, the market arrives at an average
expectation for a share or currency pair's price development. In our
case – the dollar versus euro.

Specifically, they are subject to (measurable) underlying interest rate
differences, inflation, unemployment figures, trade, and capital flow
for exchange rates. Simultaneously, a large part of the pricing is also
related to 'event' risks that cannot be gauged in advance and changing
market sentiment. Let’s go more in-depth in this Euro to Dollar
forecast.

The article covers the following subjects:

## History of the EUR/USD Pair

The Euro (EUR) is a fairly young currency that was born in 1999. The
single European currency has replaced a whole galaxy of the EU
countries' national currencies: The Deutsche mark, the French franc, the
Italian lira, and others. Therefore, one of the euro's features is its
susceptibility to macroeconomic statistics of the entire Eurozone and
individual EU countries' indicators.

The European currency was officially introduced into non-cash
circulation on January 1, 1999, and on January 1, 2002, banknotes and
coins were introduced into cash circulation. In [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of the volume of
use in international payments, the euro is second only to the US dollar.
It is also the second most popular (after USD) reserve world currency.
At the time of the official start of trading, the EUR/USD rate was in
the 1.1800 area.

Since the beginning of trading in 1999, the [EUR/USD][1] pair has
undergone significant changes. In the first two years, the euro's
prospects were still vague, and the quotation was declining, reaching a
minimum of around 0.8200. The pair then rallied for seven years,
reaching an all-time high of 1.6000 in 2008. In subsequent years, due to
the banking crisis's influence and various problems in the Eurozone, the
pair corrected significantly.

To check how has the rate of EUR/USD changed over time and EUR/USD
current price, please follow [this link to the extended [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) price
chart][1].

## Sharp Moves of the Dollar in 2020

In [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of market sentiment, 2020 has been a very illustrative year.
During the first coronavirus wave in March, the market was unpleasantly
surprised by the severity, magnitude, and impact of the coronavirus
pandemic, causing [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s to flee to the dollar as a safe haven.

Initially, the coronavirus was thought to be "a Chinese problem only."
Still, as the virus began to spread faster worldwide - locking up
economies around the world - the dollar exchange rate was reca[Libra](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/libra-creator/)ted
in no time.

A similar revision took place three months ago but in the opposite
direction. When pharmaceutical company Pfizer released positive vaccine
[news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) in early November, the dollar fell in value due to the
disappearance of the need for a safe haven.

In both cases, the market reaction was apparent, but that is not always
the case. Take the announced financial support packages from the
European Central Bank (ECB) this year. Whereas in the past, the
availability of more euros often caused downward pressure on the euro,
such packages resulted in an upward price movement this year.

Coronavirus support was "suddenly" perceived as positive by the market.
According to [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s, the ECB showed it was doing everything it could
to prevent companies from collapsing and safeguard employees' jobs.

Precisely because of the occurrence of unforeseen market conditions and
the sometimes-surprising market reaction to them, our starting point is
that you should always take price estimates with a grain.

For example, at the end of 2018, many market parties anticipated a
weaker dollar, but in 2019 the dollar picked up with the US-Chinese
trade war as a catalyst. That created a lot of uncertainty, causing
capital to flow to safe havens like the dollar. Such events are
difficult to envision, and this was especially true in recent years with
a fickle character like Donald Trump at the helm in the United States.

## EUR/USD Current Rate

The current rate of the EUR/USD pair is $1.19325. Below, you can see an
interactive chart from Forex in real-time:

## Characteristic Features of the EUR/USD Pair

The [EUR/USD][1] pair belongs to the major currency pairs (majors) and
is characterized by increased liquidity. This is not surprising, as it
includes two of the world's major reserve currencies: USD and EUR. It is
in the euro/dollar that the largest volume of transactions is made
during [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) trading on the Forex market (approximately 20% of the total
volume).

The behavior of the EUR/USD pair is a kind of indicator showing the
comparative state of the US and EU economies. If the US economy is
growing steadily, and problems arise in the EU, EUR, this might cause a
EURO to US dollar fall. Conversely, if there is a decline in growth
rates in the US and the Eurozone demonstrates good performance, the
EUR/USD pair will grow. Let's consider the main trading characteristics
of this pair:

  * Active trading hours - the pair is traded around the clock except for weekends. It is most active during the European and American trading sessions. It is at this time that the largest trading volumes take place, and the main movements of the EUR/USD pair take place.
  * Volatility - the EUR/USD pair is characterized by medium volatility. During the release of important data, the pair is capable of making strong movements from 100 points and above. But in general, if you look at the [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) data, the average [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) volatility of the EUR/USD pair is about 80 pips.
  * Spread is one of the main advantages of this pair. Due to the highest liquidity, the spread for the EUR/USD pair is minimal. On popular ECN accounts, the spread is usually less than 1 pip.

## The Dollar in 2021: More Predictable?

Perhaps the direction of the dollar will become a little easier to
predict under President Biden. First of all, financial markets are
counting on the new US president to run less internationally and deal
more diplomatically with trade disputes. This provides more peace and
security in the financial markets, reducing the need for a haven such as
the dollar.

Also, Biden is expected to spend (a lot) of money to continue to
stimulate the US economy, including post-corona, which will further
increase the US's debt position. The fact that interest rates will
remain low for a longer period also plays a role: at the most recent
meeting of the Federal Reserve, Chairman Jerome Powell hinted that he
would not have an interest rate hike until mid-2023.

All of this leads to an estimate that capital flows towards emerging
markets and currencies will continue to flow at the US dollar expense.
Countries such as Indonesia and Mexico have aggressively lowered their
interest rates, but interest rates in these countries are still
considerably higher than in the United States.

Besides, countries such as China, South Korea, and Taiwan have had the
coronavirus outbreak reasonably under control for some time now. In
combination with optimism about the arrival of COVID vaccines, this
means that [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are, in any case, moving to more risky markets.

## EUR/USD Technical Analysis

The foreign exchange market traditionally has "political noise." It
reacts more intensely to political influences than the stock market,
which is understandable since politics can significantly influence the
respective national economy's prospects.

The euro rose significantly against the US dollar in November, and
December is such a "political movement." The election victory of the US
Democrats fueled fears that more [regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/) of the economy and trade and
tax increases will result in the growth of the US economy being slowed
down, the US Federal Reserve intervening even more intensively. With it,
the yield level on the bond market and less stability in the US economy
will make the greenback less attractive as an investment currency.

This is a very generalized way of thinking, especially since this
black/white way of thinking turned out to be wrong at the end of many
previous democratic governments. And doubts are slowly creeping in about
this because the US dollar is gaining ground again, the euro is coming
back. But is that a downward trend relevant in the medium term? Does
that mean the strong phase of the euro is over?

This would suggest that fears about tax increases and [regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/) have
not been confirmed so far. The Biden government is trying to push a lot
to prevent the US economy from falling back into recession, while Europe
has not so far been watching. The EU is currently looking paralyzed
here, the economy is languishing in a repeatedly extended lockdown, and
the long-term consequences of this situation are hardly foreseeable. It
seems as if the "safer" investment currency and the more attractive
yield level on the bond market in the coming years will be more likely
to be found in the USA, and therefore the US dollar is more in demand
than the euro. But:

The chart is not yet showing a real downward turn for the [EUR/USD][1]
outlook. Only if the exchange rate euro to dollar again undercuts the
important, long-term containment zone 1.1876/1.2042 US dollars, to which
the bulls had rushed in vain for a long time until the outbreak in
December, would it slowly turn out to be Establish a bearish scenario
for the euro exchange rates forecast.

And even then, it could just be a correction resulting in a pullback to
the breakout level. The two long-term downtrend lines would define the
breakout level; the lower one is currently at 1.14 US dollars.

From there, the euro bulls could take off again, therefore: Should the
euro/US dollar slide into the range between 1.14 and 1.1876 US dollars,
it would be in a neutral zone in the medium and long term, in which the
field should be left to the short-term traders.

But rising above this range, the euro bulls would still have every
chance of reaching the next, larger target price of 1.2555 US dollars,
because as long as the EURO to USD trend lasts, the players in the forex
market prove themselves against changes in their previous political
opinions are often considered to be quite resilient.

## Euro/dollar weekly price forecast as of 22.03.2021

The euro bulls, following the correction up in the medium-term
downtrend, haven’t reached the key resistance at 1.2011 – 1.1995. Within
the resistance zone, there is a strong technical level – 1.2006. If the
price reaches the trend border, we shall watch the sellers’ reaction and
enter new sell trades with the target at March low.

As the Target Zone 2, 1.1922 – 1.1906, has not been broken out, one
could consider the euro purchases with the target at last week’s high.

The RSI oscillator allows us to consider EURUSD trades in both
directions.

### [EURUSD][1] Trading ideas for the week:

  1. Enter/hold longs from the level of 1.1896. TakeProfit: 1.1985. StopLoss: 1.1863.
  2. Sell according to the pattern in Target Zone 1.2011 - 1.1995. TakeProfit: 1.1838, Target Zone 3 1.1762 - 1.1746. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Long-Term Euro to USD Forecast 2025-2030

Any long-term forecasts for 2025-2030, even for the [EUR/USD][1] pair or
any other currency pair, are too unreliable to include in our
predictions. This Euro to Dollar forecast would be pure speculation. For
this reason, we will not provide prediction charts beyond 2023. Too many
factors may affect the rate of currency pairs and the EUR/USD
projection, and it’s best to be up-to-date with what’s happening in the
global arena in order to make realistic and reliable predictions. In the
next section of our article, we have described in detail what factors
may affect the quotes of the EUR/USD pair.

### Which Factors Affect the Quotes of the EUR/USD Currency Pair?

The EUR/USD rate is the ratio of the currencies of the two largest
economies in the world – the EU and the USA. Therefore, important
economic and political [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) from the EU and the US directly affects the
euro-dollar rate. These factors of influence are called fundamental; in
addition to them, there are also technical ones. Let's consider both
those and others in more detail:

#### Fundamental Factors

There are several important economic indicators for the US and EU. The
most significant indicators affecting the course of a pair include the
following:

  * Change in interest rates of the ECB and the Fed (Interest rate)
  * Unemployment Rate
  * Data on jobs created in the US (Nonfarm Payrolls)
  * Growth rate of GDP (GDP)
  * Inflation indices (CPI, PPI)
  * Industrial production (Industrial Production index)
  * Retail Sales
  * Trade balance (Trade Balance)
  * Consumer Confidence Index
  * Indices of business sentiment (ISM, IFO)
  * Speeches by top officials - press conferences of the heads of the ECB and the Fed, speeches, and comments by leading politicians from the EU and the United States. For example, Trump's tweets could provoke significant movement in a currency pair.
  * Political events - various reshuffles in the government, elections, popular unrest, internal political instability (e.g., Brexit)
  * Force majeure - extraordinary events, natural disasters, man-made disasters, terrorist attacks, epidemics

#### Technical Factors

  * Active trend - an essential technical factor for trading is the presence of an active trend. In an uptrend, purchases are preferable; in a downtrend, sales are recommended, in a sideways trend (range), trading in both directions from the boundaries of the price range is appropriate.
  * Important support and resistance levels are [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) highs and lows on the price chart. These are important price reference points for analyzing and predicting the future movement of the pair.
  * Price patterns - various patterns of continuation or reversal of a trend from classical technical analysis, candlestick patterns, Price Action patterns.

## Is EUR/USD Still a Good Investment?

The [EUR/USD][1] currency pair is still quite young; its trading life
began quite recently – in 1999. But despite their youth, this pair
confidently took first place in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of the volume of transactions on
Forex. Due to its enormous liquidity, projection, availability, and low
spread, the pair enjoys well-deserved popularity among traders. Below is
a EUR/USD prediction chart for 2021:

Month| Open| Low-High| Close| Mo,%| Total,%  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
2021

But what does the [EUR/USD][1] forecast predict for the distant future?
It’s important to remember that any long-term forecasts, even the
EUR/USD forecast, or any other currency pair, are too unreliable to make
predictions for. Too many factors may affect the rate of currency pairs,
and it’s best to be up-to-date with what’s happening in the global arena
in order to make realistic and reliable predictions.
