What is Hedging in Forex?Mikhail Hypov

Dear friends!

Today I will deal with Forex hedging. This risk management strategy in
[Forex trading](https://www.fintechee.com/forex-trading-strategies/) is first of all an instrument to reduce or remove the
risks associated with making financial transactions. Besides, some
traders managed to transform the idea of this method and turn it into a
profitable Forex trading strategy.

Unfortunately, many traders do not realize all benefits of limiting
risks, after simple tactics of capital protection fail. So, I want to
explain in simple [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) Forex hedging strategies so that you can see all
the advantages of protecting your deposit before you suffer from
significant losses.

The article covers the following subjects:

## What is hedging in Forex?

Hedging implies protection against the risk of future price fluctuations
of assets arranged in advance. This method allows insurance against
unwanted exposure to the risks that resulted from trading in the Forex
market and other financial transactions.

> Hedging is a financial strategy used to protect a trader from losing
trades resulting from adverse moves of currency pairs.

The concept of insurance is the closest to this risk management
strategy.

Hedging is used in almost all types of financial businesses but it has a
more specific form in the foreign exchange market.

Traders often use the so-called correlated currency pairs to hedge
against the currency risks.

Correlated pairs move in sync, in the same direction. In addition to
positively correlated pairs, there can be used currency pairs with
negative correlation, they are also moving symmetrically, but in
opposite directions. In this case, a trader opens two long or two short
positions. You can learn more about currency pairs’ correlation here.

Hedging involves opening a long position and a short position with the
same risk size. The positions can be opened on the same currency pair or
two or more trading assets. If a trader selects two currency pairs, they
should be positively correlated.

Note on the terminology:

> Long position (a long) is a buy position;

>

> Short position (a short) is a sell position.

Another forex hedging strategy involves opening two long positions on
two currency pairs that are negatively correlated.

For example, [EURUSD][1] and [USDCHF][2] have a strong negative
correlation. It means when the first pair is rising the second one faces
a drop by a related number of points. The Forex hedging strategy, in
this case, will look like this:

  * Open a long position on the[][1][EURUSD][1];
  * Open a long position on the[][2][USDCHF][2].

However, an equal volume of trades is required only in case of perfect
or full hedging. There is also a partial Forex hedging strategy as a way
to protect your position from some of the risks. You can open such
positions when there are strong signals for a particular trading
scenario. I will cover the hedging strategies in detail below.

For example, if you are sure that the [EURUSD][1] market will be rising
then opening the [USDCHF][2] of a smaller size will increase your profit
compared to the full hedge. However, in the case of a negative scenario,
you will compensate for only a part of the losses.

### Is hedging legal?

At the national level, hedging and stock speculation are not always
considered legal tools of Forex risk insurance. Oddly enough, some
hedging operations are prohibited even in the United States. One of the
prohibitions concerns hedging in the Forex market. It is illegal in the
United States to simultaneously buy and sell the same currency pair at
the same or different strike prices.

To ensure that hedged positions are prohibited, the CFTC (Commodity
Futures Trading Commission) obliged brokers to include an OCO (One
Cancels Other) order in their platforms. This order prohibits buying and
selling the same pair. The financial commission also applied the FIFO
rule, which requires traders to close their open trades only in the
order they were opened in.

The main reason for such prohibitions is considered to be double trade
costs with an insignificant trading result. They result in brokers
making much more profit than traders.

Internationally, Forex hedging is considered a legal risk insurance
tool. In particular, the EU, Asia and Australia have freedom of choice
of methods and strategies used in trading. Simultaneously buying and
selling the same currency pair is not prohibited there. Brokers actively
support this [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the financial authorities as trade hedging brings
them twice the spread than regular short and long positions.

## How does hedging work in the Forex market?

Let's consider what hedging is in simple [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/). In order to keep your
capital protected, the easiest way is to close a trade that may soon
become unprofitable. At first, it seems pointless to continue to buy or
sell when you can simply exit the market in the breakeven zone. However,
in some cases, opening opposite trades may be more convenient than
closing them normally. Consider an example of risk-limiting on the
[EURUSD][3] pair.

Suppose that initially, the trader thought the pair would continue to
move upward rapidly relying on the intrinsic value of the dollar. He
decided to profit from the expected growth entering a but trade at the
green line.

However, the subsequent downward reversal made the trader reconsider the
initial forecast. Instead of closing a long position with a small
profit, he minimizes the risk of the price going down further with a
short trade at the closing of the second downward bar (red line).

Subsequently, he leaves the two opposite trades until a signal for a
reversal in the form of a cross shows up. As soon as the bullish
sentiment takes over the market, the trader closes the short trade at
the level of the purple line.

The resulting profit allows you to manage the risk more freely since it
is able to compensate for losses should the downward movement continue.
Therefore, the trader can calmly watch the market, hoping that after the
reversal the value of the asset will begin to grow.

The growth continued just as the trader expected. When the upward
movement turns into a flat, which is signalled by several consecutive
bars with large shadows, the trader closes the long trade at a price
much higher than the opening price.

The trader managed to get double profit from the two trades. In the
event of a negative scenario, the trader would not be able to make money
on hedging. However, the losses would be minimal. It is precisely due to
the possibility of making large profits with insignificant risks that
experienced traders prefer to limit risks to leaving the market in the
breakeven zone.

The hedging trade does not have to be opened on the same asset that was
used to open the main trade. Moreover, many brokers do not have this
function at all. One can always use trading instruments with a high
negative or positive correlation. [Here is my article][4] about Forex
correlation.

## How to hedge in forex?

Hedging is all about reducing your risk, to protect against unwanted
price moves. It suggests opening a position that will reduce the total
loss in a negative scenario.

For example, when you buy the GBP/USD and USD/CHF [currency pairs][5] at
the same time, as they are negatively correlated. If one pair starts
moving in the unwanted direction, another one will be yielding a profit
compensating for the loss yielded by the first one. There various
strategies of [how to](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-trading-how-to/) limit risks in Forex:

  * Buy currency pairs that move in the opposite directions;
  * Buy and simultaneously sell the currency pairs that positively correlate;
  * Buy and sell the same currency pair at the same price simultaneously;
  * Buy and sell the same Forex trading instrument at the same time but at different prices;

The last two forex hedging strategies can be also referred to as locking
in. You can learn more about why traders use locks and what you should
do if you get a lock in the article that explains [everything about
locks in trading][6].

### Hedging and using a stop loss

Each trading terminal has an [automated](https://www.fintechee.com/features/automated-forex-trading/) take profit function, but it also
has a stop loss. A stop-loss is an offsetting order that gets you out of
a trade if the price moves against you by an amount you specify.
Beginners do not like using a stop loss as they hope to gain back the
loss.

The major error of a beginner trader is to hold a losing trade and wait
until the price reverses and turns a losing trade into a winning one.

That is why before you buy an asset, you need to analyze the market
sentiment and define the maximum drawdown level. If the risk exceeds the
amount required by the risk management rule, you’d better not enter a
trade.

If the market situation seems favourable, but the potential risk doesn’t
allow you to enter a trade with a full lot, you can reduce the position
size. Different [Forex trading](https://www.fintechee.com/forex-trading-strategies/) strategies suggest different ratios of a
take profit versus a stop loss, but the potential profit should always
be bigger than the loss. Besides, you should take into account the
spread, the difference between the buy and sell prices.

If you want your forex hedging tactics to be a system, you need to
observe just two rules:

  1. Define the level of the stop loss before you enter a trade.
  2. Never move your stop loss once you set it.

It will allow you to solve another problem of beginner traders, a low
level of discipline. If you set a level without proper analysis and face
a loss, you will analyze the market situation more thoroughly next time.

### Currency correlation and Forex hedging

Correlation is a statistical measure of how different currency pairs
move at approximately the same time. They can move either in the same
direction (positive correlation) or opposite (negative correlation)
direction.

Typically, traders use the correlation of currency pairs to confirm
their forecasts.

One can hedge trades using correlated pairs, for example, by opening two
identical positions on currency pairs with a negative correlation.

It is not easy to calculate the correlation of currency pairs manually,
so traders use special indicators for this purpose. LiteForex has
created a convenient correlation calculator that shows how much
different trading instruments correlate.

Try to calculate the correlation for the [EURUSD][1] pair using the
calculator below:

As you can see, the three most promising instruments with positive
correlation for [EURUSD][1] include NZDUSD, EURJPY, AUDUSD, as for the
negative one, those are USDDKK, USDCHF, USDSEK.

More information on currency correlation and the calculator itself can
be found [here][4].

## How to hedge forex trades?

Let us study an example of hedging in forex, based on classical
technique, using one currency pair [EURUSD][1].

Let us assume the situation that the EURUSD has been trading in a
bullish trend for a long time. We expect the trend reversal down, and we
expect a reversal signal delivered by [candlestick patterns][7].

There are two consecutive down bars in the chart (marked with the blue
oval in the above chart) as a confirmation of the shooting star pattern
(a bearish candlestick with a long upper shadow and a small lower shadow
or no shadow at all). So, we enter a short trade of 1 lot at the level
of the red horizontal line, around 1.13:

Next, holding a sell position, we see that there is a sideways move
instead of a steady bear trend. When there are two up candlesticks with
full bodies, which almost engulf the entire bear move, there is a strong
risk that the [EURUSD][1] pair will go up and the uptrend will continue
(I highlighted the situation with the second blue oval on the right):

To reduce this risk, we enter a position, opposite the first one, of the
same volume, 1 lot. In the above chart, the buy price on the [EURUSD][3]
is marked with the green line, it is at about 1.134.

Thus, two trades will overlap each other and protect our deposit. We fix
the level of a potential loss of 400 points (the spread between opening
short and long positions) under the conditions of strong uncertainty.

Now we can safely track the market without fear of significant losses.
If the price nevertheless goes down, we will close the long position and
take the profit from the short one. If there is a signal of the bull
trend continuation, we shall exit the short position, and a long one
will start yielding a profit.

### An example of Forex hedging strategy

Let us study another example of full hedging forex trades. This time, we
will additionally calculate the potential loss and profit resulting from
exiting the hedge.

In the situation, marked with the blue oval in the above chart, we
decided that the price should go up soon. So, once the bar closes, we
open a long position at 1.08578 (green line).

However, the price continues going down and breaks through the support
level at 1.08180 marked with the red horizontal line. There is quite a
strong signal of the bear trend continuation. To protect our capital
against losses, we shall apply Forex hedging. To insure against big
losses, we will open the opposite position of the same volume at the
level of 1.08166 after the down candlestick closes.

Thus, the difference between these two opposite positions is only
0.00412 points. This is the amount of loss that we have limited with the
help of Forex hedging.

The chart above shows that the full hedging of Forex positions was
appropriate. This forex strategy allowed us to safely wait while the
market was moving in an unwanted direction. The bull trend resumes after
a while.

When the price has consolidated sufficiently above the initial position
at 1.08852 (black line in the chart) we exit the short trade, thereby
fixing 0.00686 points of losses resulting from the short position (the
short entry-level - short exit level). However, the trade itself has not
yet been completed, since we still have a long position, opened at
1.08578.

As you see from the chart, there is a strong bullish momentum next. We
are following the bull trend and exit the buy position when there
emerges a shooting star reversal pattern and two confirming red
candlesticks down (highlighted with purple in the chart). We close the
position at level 1.09484, marked with the purple line.

Thus, the net profit yielded by the long without taking into account
commissions amounted to 0.00906 points (1.09484 - 1.08578), and the
total profit from the whole trade - 0.00220 points (0.00906 - 0.00686).
As you can see, the total profit was much reduced because of hedging.
However, we are fully insured against the risk of loss that could result
from a negative scenario.

### Forex Hedging Methods

Well, we have already studied the example of Forex hedging. Now, let us
see what ways of capital protection exist and what peculiarities they
have. First, let me describe the parameters according to which the
methods of hedging are classified:

#### Type of hedging instruments

There are foreign exchange and over-the-counter types of hedging
instruments. Forex hedge trades are entered, as the definition implies,
on the foreign exchange with the participation of a counterparty, which,
in the case of Forex, is the brokerage company. Over the counter hedge
positions can not be opened on an asset exchange. They are not traded in
the market and usually conducted once.

#### The volume of risk that is compensated

There can be full or partial Forex hedging. The full one insures against
risks for the whole sum of the deal. The partial one implies the
insurance only of a part of the deal. It is used if there are minor
risks.

#### Buyer or seller

Depending on whether you bet on the price rise or fall, you put a buyer
hedge or a seller hedge. In the first case, capital is insured against a
possible increase in prices, and the second - a decrease.

#### Type of trading asset

Forex hedging can be pure or cross. A pure hedge involves an opposite
transaction for the same trading asset. In the case of cross hedging,
the hedge position is opened for a different asset. In this case, the
second asset should correlate with the underlying asset, that is, its
price should depend on the price of the underlying asset.

For example, when the price of the underlying asset is moving up, the
value of the asset that we used for the hedge should also be moving up
or down on a relative scale.

#### Time of opening the main position

According to this parameter, a forex hedging strategy can be classical
or anticipatory.

In the first case, the opposite position is opened immediately after the
main (insured) one. An example of a classical hedge is buying an option
covering the main trade.

The second strategy implies putting a hedge long before the insured
position is opened, as it happens in the case of buying futures.

### Types of Forex hedging strategies

Depending on the above characteristics, there are several types of
hedging strategies.

Please note!

  * In order for profits to exceed losses when hedging, the selected instruments should be highly volatile and trades should be opened within the day.
  * All types of hedging strategies are based on the basic rule of risk management - you cannot lose more than 5% of the deposit in one trade. Moreover, you cannot invest more than 10% of your capital into assets with a strong positive correlation.

#### Full hedge or perfect hedge

It involves opening a position of the same volume as the first one but
in the opposite direction to buy or sell the same asset. Thus, you fully
protect the deposit invested in the first trade from the risks of price
movement in an unwanted direction.

#### Partial hedge

With low potential risks of price movement in an unfavourable direction,
it is possible to insure the main transaction only partially. In this
case, the potential profit increases, and at the same time, the hedging
costs are reduced. However, if you underestimate the risks, you may face
unforeseen losses.

#### Anticipatory hedge

It involves the purchase of a futures contract at a fixed price with the
expectation that the asset will be sold at an optimal price in the
future.

#### Forex cross hedge

This method involves opening a position on an asset different from that
of the main trade. As I already have written before, an example of a
cross hedge is opening long positions on EURUSD and USDCHF.

#### Selective hedging

It is a rather complicated Forex hedging strategy that is recommended
only for experienced traders.

It involves opening positions in the underlying asset market and the
derivatives (insurance) market. The positions will differ both in time
and size.

The flexibility of the strategy allows you to choose the best
proportions, achieving the optimal ratio of the potential profits to
existing trading risks.

 _Let us study an example:_

Suppose you buy 1,000 shares at the beginning of the year and plan to
sell them at a higher price in the third quarter. In the second quarter,
you put an option to sell 1,500 shares. At the same time, the
calculations made allow you to expect with a high degree of probability
to make profits from both positions closed at different times.

#### Inter-industry hedging

It involves heading the position on the assets of one sector by a
position on the asset of another sector. For example, you can hedge
against an unwanted market move in the EURUSD market by CFDs on energy
resources.

Most of the covered Forex hedging strategies are employed by traders or
funds combining different instruments or even strategies. I have covered
in detail some of such systems, namely, the [hedged grid forex
strategies][8], Forex grid and Forex Double Grid Strategy, in one of my
[educational articles. ][9]

Now is the time to summarize the above information and briefly talk
about the main pros and cons of hedging.

## Advantages of Forex hedging

There are a lot of advantages in employing risk-limiting strategies,
that is why Forex hedging strategies are so popular.

Let us study all pros of using hedging strategies in Forex trading:

### 1\. Universal applicability of hedging.

Due to a wide range of forex hedging strategies and instruments, it can
be applied in any market, for any trading instrument and by traders of
any level of skills. It is used by [individual trader](https://www.fintechee.com/services/individual-trader/)s, global investment
funds and it can be even an element of economic policies of a whole
country.

By the way, common people often use hedging as a strategy, when they,
for example, invest in gold or foreign currency to insure against the
risks of the local currency depreciation. Another example, on a global
scale, is the target program for the development of tourism in the
United Arab Emirates, in order to diversify sources of income and reduce
dependence on hydrocarbon exports. The state sells “Oil” and buys
“Tourism”.

### 2\. Flexibility and versatility of the approach.

This point is a logical extension of the first one. The flexibility of
hedging results from the logical simplicity of the approach and, at the
same time, the widest range of tools that make the hedging process
almost universal and applicable to any transaction. Due to such a wide
range of hedging tools, it is subdivided into many types:

  * Full and partial;
  * Traditional and selective;
  * Stock exchange, over the counter and mixed;
  * Pure and cross;
  * Anticipatory and classical.

### 3\. Risk diversification.

It is a kind of mantra for any [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/). Risk diversification can be
considered as an example of selective and cross hedging. This definition
can be described by the proverb “Do not put all eggs into the same
basket!”.

The logic of this statement is quite simple and clear. However, in the
financial world, it is not so easy to follow this rule.

Principles of hedging facilitate achieving the facilitation goals for an
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/), defining the two major rules: it is the segmentation of assets
and the correlation of asset prices in the portfolio.

Segmentation means that the assets in the portfolio should belong to
different markets, industries, and forms of ownership. For example, a
portfolio that includes only cryptocurrencies is less diversified than a
portfolio that also includes other assets, for example, shares or bonds.

I think the logic here is clear. The correlation between the asset price
is covered in this article and many others in the [LiteForex trading
blog][10]. I don’t think I can add anything here.

### 4\. Hedging allows traders not only to reduce the risks but also to
make profits.

The primary goal of hedging is insurance against risks. In this regard,
it is often opposed to using a stop loss, which is a big mistake. One
could easily describe the principle of hedging as “All that is not lost
is earned." However, speaking of it as a strategy for active trading,
the concept of profit takes on a more significant meaning.

[Grid [trading strategies](https://www.fintechee.com/forex-trading-strategies/)][8], for example, give good opportunities to
make good profits with almost no risks. Employing this [Forex trading](https://www.fintechee.com/forex-trading-strategies/)
strategy, you can make profits even if there is no clear trend.

Another element of hedging, which is already actively used by
institutional [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s to make money, is Carry trades. A carry trade is
a low-interest loan in one currency and opening deposits with higher
yields in another. There are also such derivatives as futures and
[options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/), whose primary role is hedging. However, these instruments are
now more popular for speculators in active trading.

### 5\. Relevance of Forex hedging technique

Understanding the principles of hedging and the ability to correctly
employ the strategies are especially important during crises and
economic turmoil. Many trading companies, financial institutions and
even central banks of various countries have their own hedging
strategies in order to ensure stable operation in times of high market
turbulence.

You may not even think about it, but you always hear or read about
hedging in the media. Instead of this word, they often use such
expressions as “risk aversion”, “safe haven”, “burning money”, and so
on. Whenever we hear in the [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) that some large investment funds have
sold stocks and switched to gold and government bonds, we understand
that they are simply hedging risks. We as [individual trader](https://www.fintechee.com/services/individual-trader/)s can also
use hedging strategies in Forex trading.

## Disadvantages of Forex hedging

Now, let us have a look at the drawbacks of Forex hedging, they are not
that numerous, but still, there are some:

### 1\. There is no guarantee that your deposit is fully protected.

It is a big mistake to believe that hedging is the same as a stop loss.
Unfortunately, many beginner traders think so and lose their deposits as
a result. You should realize that this method doesn’t guarantee the
security of your funds.

Neither does it guarantee you will make profits. Hedging is just an
approach to reduce the risks, but not to fully eliminate them.

### 2\. Funds freezing.

Hedging can require quite a large amount of spare funds. This is
especially relevant with regard to full hedging when you need to double
your investments and open the second position to cover the first one
entirely.

Most commonly, other alternative investments would yield more profits
than just being pledged against open transactions in order to avoid
losses.

### 3\. Psychological trap.

If you actively apply hedging in your trading, you may have a false
feeling that your positions can never yield a loss and your funds are
entirely secure. Such a trader uses locking too much, increases the
risks, and uses very high leverage.

Such a trader may not use stop losses, as he/she mistakenly thinks that
they do not need to stop losses as they can simply lock a losing trade
up and wait until the price reverses in a needed direction. However,
everything is not that simple in reality. You can learn more about locks
in the Forex [here][6].

### 4\. Extra costs.

Hedging usually involves extra costs. When opening a position to limit
the risks, you have to pay commission fees. In the case of Forex
trading, there can be extra costs that result from the spread and the
swap fees. Beginner traders usually do not consider these costs when
building their trading systems based on forex hedging strategies.

### 5\. High standards for trading skills.

I mean the high requirements for analytical skills and trading
experience of a trader or an [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/), who wants to use hedging in their
individual [trading strategies](https://www.fintechee.com/forex-trading-strategies/). Although the logic is simple, it is not
easy to apply in real trading. Hedging is a rather serious subject for
study, which is primarily associated with a wide range of different
instruments and methods.

A newbie should spend much time and effort studying theory. Furthermore,
the theory is nothing without practice. Experiments with hedging forex
strategies may often result in losses.

So, the experience will also cost some money. Those who are not willing
to spend time, effort, and money, may not satisfy the requirements.

## Automated trading with hedging

Forex hedging with [automated](https://www.fintechee.com/features/automated-forex-trading/) trading tools or [robot](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/automated-forex-trading-robot/)s can bring many
benefits to a trader. Robots maintain the value of the asset at its
original level with little or no user intervention and thus free him
from the need to perform a lot of routine operations.

Automated systems open additional buy or sell positions based on market
analysis. Robots assess the likelihood of a trend developing, reversing,
its potential strength and duration, and many other factors to ensure
that the risk is minimized.

Automated hedging in Forex is used by both traders and stock speculators
and large businesses. For example, Deutsche Bank has been testing the
Maestro risk hedging application in the online banking system for
several years.

The application allows you to download or manually enter information
about your current trading, analyzes the market and launches the
procedure for limiting currency risk. One of the advantages of this app
is an adaptive approach. Users can download statistics both in the form
of aggregated Forex positions and in the form of separate transactions.
You can do it as frequently as you want. The user can access the Forex
market every day or every hour, upload new transactions and add them to
the application’s database.

The functionality of the app allows for full balance insurance. The
total risk is calculated based on information about the ratio of
accounts payable and receivable, liquidity in the bank account, as well
as any hedging transactions in the Forex market. Once all positions are
uploaded into the database, the app analyzes the market, calculating the
necessary hedge adjustment.

An in-app adjustment is a common transaction that can be entered into
automatically or after a review by the user, and modified if necessary.

The introduction of automatic hedging of Forex transactions based on the
Maestro application has shown good results with many Deutsche Bank
client companies. However, the practical implementation of automatic
Forex hedging requires the participation of specialists who can
configure the software to perform the necessary tasks.

The same can be said about auto trading using hedge [advisor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/expert-advisor/)s. To get a
stable profit from trading, you need to master the theory that can be
found in this article, and learn [how to](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-trading-how-to/) apply it.

## What is currency hedging?

Currency hedging is opening short and long trades in order to reduce the
risk occurring in Forex trading. This financial manoeuvre allows you to
eliminate the impact price fluctuations have on the market, in order to
make trading similar to a currency exchange which is carried out at a
fixed rate.

I will give a simple example of currency hedging. Let's say you are
going to buy [USDJPY][11] expecting the pair to grow. However, some
important [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) that may provoke short-term volatility should come out
soon. With a small deposit or high leverage, even relatively small
fluctuations in the financial markets may leave you without any funds in
your account.

In such cases, it is necessary to think about the risk and open an
opposite trade as a hedge against possible losses. When the market is
quiet again and has low volatility levels, the hedge position can be
closed, and profit can be then taken from the main trade.

Due to the discrepancy between the set price and the market execution
price, spreads and broker's commissions, you will often incur small
losses while opening opposite trades. However, they are worth it if you
think about the risks you could face.

With the right approach, you can also make use of volatility, that is,
make a profit from two trades at once, as shown in the example above.

Let's consider the types of currency risks in more detail and learn more
about the methods of limiting risk exposure with regards to them.

There are four basic types of foreign exchange risks:

 **Transaction risk** , also known as conversion risk is the risk to
receive a smaller profit or even a loss resulting from export operations
due to negative changes in the exchange rate of the currencies used. It
can be reduced by restricting exports, determining the optimal price
level for exporters and importers and securities in which they are
expressed, by narrowing the time range for receipt and payment of funds,
using the currency of receipts to cover costs.

In Forex trading, the insurance against the Forex risks means entering
two trades in opposite directions, which provides a chance of getting
both a loss and a profit.

 **Translation risk** (settlement or balance sheet risk). It is based on
the discrepancy between profit and loss denominated in the currencies of
different countries. For example, a US international company has a
subsidiary in Germany.

Consequently, part of its assets is denominated in euros. If it does not
have liabilities comparable to US assets, then the euro-denominated
assets are exposed to currency risks. The depreciation of the euro will
cause a decrease in the earning value of the parent company, which is
expressed in US dollars.

Likewise, a significant excess of liabilities over assets will create
even greater risks if the euro price rises versus the US dollar.
Therefore, the only way to protect the company’s funds from settlement
risks is to maintain a balance between assets and liabilities.

 **Economic risk** refers to a negative impact of unfavorable currency
fluctuations on any aspects related to the company’s activities:
commodity circulation, production, demand, production cost, competition,
etc. As a result, the company’s market value will decline, as well as
its economic performance. Least of all economic risks affect companies
that bear costs solely in the local currency.

 **Hidden risk.** It may refer to any of the above. The only difference
is that it is not taken into account in the company’s economic and
financial [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), that is why it is hidden. For example, one or several
suppliers of a company can use imported resources in production, and the
price of supplied components can rise sharply as a result of Forex
volatility.

There are several ways to hedge against the above-mentioned risks.

### Types of Forex hedging

Hedging instruments come into two groups:

  * Exchange-traded assets (exchange-traded futures, swaps, and [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/));
  * Over-the-counter (OTC) assets (forward contracts, over-the-counter swaps, and [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/)).

Exchange-traded products feature high liquidity, low credit risks, and
the clearinghouse guarantees that the other side of any transaction
performs to its obligations.  However, the type of underlying assets,
[terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/), and conditions of delivery are strictly standardized.

Over-the-counter products (OTC), on the contrary, allows the [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) to
put forward the most convenient requirements for the type of assets and
[terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of the transaction, however, they are difficult to find a
counterparty, and feature high credit risks and low liquidity.

#### Futures

Futures contracts are agreements to buy or sell an asset at a
predetermined time at a specified price. In addition to the Forex
market, they are actively used in the stock market and the commodity
market.

Futures are popular because one can work with them in almost any of the
available markets. They are also standardized and have low margins
because you don’t have to invest money into them initially. They are
also able to fully compensate for losses regardless of how much the
price of stocks, commodities or currency pairs changes.

Depending on the direction of movement of the price of a financial
instrument, there are two ways to limit the risks. By buying, the
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) hedges against price increases in the future and by selling,
the [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) sells the goods to hedge against a decrease in their value.

Full hedging of Forex transactions using futures provides 100% insurance
against losses. If the risks are hedged in part, the [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) will be
able to recover only part of the losses. But the profit will also be
higher in case of a favourable scenario.

#### Options

Some traders prefer [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) to the classic futures trade. Options are
offered for futures contracts, allowing you to buy or sell an asset
before the option expires. In this case, the company pays a commission
called a premium, but it also fully hedges against losses associated
with currency fluctuations.

Here is a simple example. Let's say an oil company plans to buy
$5,000,000 worth of kerosene in a month while its main capital is stored
in euros. If the US dollar exchange rate grows by as little as 1% during
this time, then the losses will amount to $50,000. If the option is
purchased, the dollar value will be fixed at the current level. And even
if the company has to pay a premium of several thousand dollars, then
such losses will be significantly less than possible currency risks.

#### Forward contracts

A forward contract is a non-standardized contract for the delivery of an
asset at a fixed price in the future. These contracts do not apply to
exchange-traded instruments.

#### Swaps

A swap is a transaction through which two parties exchange the cash
flows or liabilities from two different financial instruments. Forex
broker swaps are an example of how a company hedges against currency
risks resulting from forex volatility.

## Conclusions on using forex hedging

Hedging in the Forex market is one of the most popular tools to limit
exposure to different kinds of trading risks. With the right
application, this method allows forex traders to reduce the risks with a
minimum loss in profits. However, the only drawback of this method in
Forex is at least a two-fold increase in the cost of opening a position.

## Forex Hedging FAQ

How to trade Forex like a hedge fund?

To answer this question let us see [how to](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-trading-how-to/) trade [beginners](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-for-beginners/), a more
experienced trader, and hedge traders. Newbies usually enter one trade
of big volume on one or several trading instruments that do not
correlate. More experienced traders enter with a minimum lot and
gradually add up to the position often averaging counter the trend.  
  
Hedge traders use a more complex approach. Their strategy, regardless of
the Forex trading system they employ, is based on the maximum
diversification of risks. Besides, they can use multiple trading
strategies that differ in the risk level, type of market analysis, and
other parameters. I will give a simple example: an aggressive strategy
may yield a good profit, and, if it fails, a more conservative strategy
will compensate for the loss.
