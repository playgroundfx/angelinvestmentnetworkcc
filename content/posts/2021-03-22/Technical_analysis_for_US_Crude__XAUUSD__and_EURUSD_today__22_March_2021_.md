Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 22.03.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

The euro is trying to break out the support level of 1.1881 and reverse
the short-term trend down.

The article covers the following subjects:

Traders broke out the Intermediary Zone 60.79 - 60.57 last week.
Therefore, at the beginning of this week, expect an oil price rise to
the Target Zone 63.28 - 62.83.

Since the opening of trading on Monday, prices have dropped to ​​the
Additional Zone 60.63 - 60.52. This caused the bulls' reaction, and the
oil price rose slightly. However, to open purchases, a pattern is
needed, which is not currently available.

Today, pay close attention to the Additional Zone. When the pattern is
formed, it will be possible to consider purchases with the target at
62.83. When the zone is broken out, it will be possible to consider
sales with the target at the border of the new trend 59.50 - 59.27.

Gold is trading in a short-term uptrend, the target of which is the
Target Zone 1786 - 1776. Now the traders are testing the support area
1730 - 1728 again. If the price didn’t break out the zone, then buy gold
with the target outlined above.

If the bears break out the level of 1722, it will be possible to sell
the precious metal in correction with the target at the trend key
support 1705 - 1700. After reaching the key support, it would be

The Friday US trading session closed within the short-term uptrend's
border. Formally, the euro buying priority remains. The key support for
today is level 1.1881. Holding the level will allow the price to return
to the Intermediary Zone and continue to grow with the target at the
Target Zone 1.2011 - 1.1995.
