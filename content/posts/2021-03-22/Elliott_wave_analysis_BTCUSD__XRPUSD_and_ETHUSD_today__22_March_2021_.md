Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 22.03.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

Bitcoin and Ethereum are forming final impulse sub-waves in the downward
zigzags. Therefore, the prices should be declining in the near future.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

Like in the previous trading week, the BTCUSD is developing the upward
impulse wave 5, with the bullish impulse [3] recently completed inside.
There is now forming the bearish correction [4], composed of three major
sub-waves (A)-(B)-(C). The price should be declining in the final sub-
wave (C) to a level of 53161.91, marked by the impulse wave (A). One
could enter sell trades in the current situation.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Sell 57696.42, TP 53161.91

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

The hourly timeframe displays the structure of the [Y] wave, which is a
part of the large corrective wave B. The [Y] wave is a simple zigzag
(A)-(B)-(C), where wave (B) is a complex correction shaped like a double
zigzag. There is now forming the upward impulse wave (C), namely its
third impulse wave 3. Wave 3 should complete soon. Next, the price
should go down a little in correction 4, and then, the market will rise
in wave 5 to a level of 0.645.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] today:

Buy 0.511, TP 0.645

* * *

## Elliott wave Ethereum analysis

The ETHUSD is forming the bearish corrective wave 4, which is an element
of the upward impulse. Correction 4 is a standard zigzag-shaped pattern,
composed of the sub-waves [a]-[b]-[c]. This pattern should end soon.
Impulse [c] is likely to finish at a level of 1704.44, marked by the [a]
impulse. Next, the market will resume rising. One could enter sell
trades in the current situation.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Sell 1781.38, TP 1704.44
