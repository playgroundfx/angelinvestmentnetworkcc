Yen needs an explanation. Forecast as of 22.03.2021Dmitri Demidenko

After stopping buying stocks [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/)s and expanding the target range for
10-year bond yields, Haruhiko Kuroda was forced to explain. How will
this affect [USDJPY][1]? Let us discuss this question and make up a
trading plan.

## Weekly yen fundamental analysis

While the Fed is not going to abandon the ultra-easy monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/),
and the ECB intends to increase asset purchases, the Bank of Japan is
removing the phrase about the acquisition of stock [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/)s in the amount of
¥6 trillion per year from the accompanying statement. The BoJ is also
expanding the target range of 10-year bonds from +/-0.2% to +/-0.25%.
[Nikkei 225][2] immediately collapsed, believing that it was a question
of monetary restriction. However, in reality, the BoJ intends to reduce
the side effects of its policies.

A sell-off in Japan's stock indices was not part of the Board of
Governors' plans. Haruhiko Kuroda was forced to explain to [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s
that the central bank does not refuse to buy specialized exchange-traded
funds. He believes that the higher the volatility, the higher the
efficiency of intervention in the stock market's life. Therefore, the
BoJ will continue to buy [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/)s, but in times of shocks at financial
markets in the amount of up to ¥12 trillion. The Japanese regulator is
following the same path as in the case of bonds. The initial purchase
price was ¥50 trillion, then it increased to ¥80 trillion, after which
the Bank of Japan refused to determine specific amounts in 2016 and
began to target profitability.

Indeed, it is unreasonable to talk about tightening monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) at a
time when Japanese inflation, unlike the US or European ones, fails to
recover.

### Inflation dynamics in the US, Eurozone and Japan

If the [Nikkei 225][2] collapse in response to the message about the
termination of buying stocks [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/)s looks logical, then the decline in
Japanese bond yields looks illogical. The widening of the target range
encourages the bond sellers to go ahead, but prices, on the contrary,
have risen. What's the matter? I think these are signs of a global
trend. The rhythm of the market is set by rates on 10-year Treasuries.
Its inability to hold above 1.7% triggered a pullback in both Japanese
bond yields and a [USDJPY][1] uptrend.

Demand for safe-haven assets has grown amid the failure of the first US-
China talks since Joe Biden took office. The parties blamed each other,
and it became clear that Washington does not intend to reset relations
with Beijing, as China had hoped. On the other hand, there is no reason
to count on the trade war's resumption, so the pullback in Treasury
rates is unlikely to be prolonged. The resumption of growth will
contribute to the recovery of the [USDJPY][1] uptrend.

### Weekly [USDJPY][1] trading plan

As the yield on US Treasuries rises, the yen regains its status as the
Forex's main safe asset. The widening of the differential of interest
rates on the US and Japanese debt rates allows carry traders to sell it
as a funding currency along with a greenback. In this regard, the [S&P
500][3] pullbacks also lead to a fall in [USDJPY][1] price. I don't
think the tech sector sell-off is serious because this is crucial for
the US's future. In this regard, the pullback of the pair from the
supports at 108.15 and 107.9 should be used for purchases.
