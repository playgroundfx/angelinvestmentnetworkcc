Patterns inside patternsDmitri Demidenko

##  **Peculiarities of a popular pattern**

Beginner traders’ desire to get in the boat with market professionals is
understandable: big players do what they like with various assets’
quotes according to their investment tactics. Going against the stream
may result in deposit losses. If a currency rate chart shows growing
highs and lows, it’s bulls that dominate. If highs and lows are falling,
the predominant force is bearish. Also, extremums may sometimes start
jumping: the market is forming both new peaks and new troughs. Traders
must know [how to](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-trading-how-to/) use such situations to their advantage.

The above mentioned pattern was first described by Thomas Bulkowski, the author of the best-selling Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns. He called it “Expanding bottom” or “Expanding top” based on where the pattern occurred - near the market low or high. In my opinion, those patterns both refer to “Expanding wedge”. I developed a work strategy applicable to this pattern of technical analysis. It implies using Fibonacci corrective levels. Let’s take an example of [EUR/USD]1. bulls’ inability to consolidate above retracement levels of 38.2% and 50% of the ultimate descending wave becomes obvious when bars have closed below them. It’s a reason for selling. Protective stop orders are placed a bit above the highs of short-term fluctuations.

 **Strategy of work using Expanding wedge pattern**

 [Coyote tactics][3] should be used here: a trader needs to wait till
either party - bulls or bears - wins. This process may be long. In some
cases, a new child “Expanding wedge” pattern will form. Its range fits
into the parent pattern’s range, and therefore we can talk of an
internal configuration.  The formation of a child pattern is an
important hint to where the quotes will move next.

 **Parent and child patterns Expanding wedge**

If we suppose that [EUR/USD][1] drops below April’s low at 1.073, forms
point 5 and finishes forming a wedge, we will be able to use the above
strategy of retracement from Fibonacci levels in future. Growth of
quotes above 78.6% and 88.6% is a bad sign for bears because then the
pair may start rallying to 1.12. Yet, a downtrend recovery looks more
likely than a trend reversal.

As for targets, I prefer setting them with the help of harmonious
trading patterns. The simpler the better. The simplest pattern is AB=CD.
Its levels of 113%, 127.2% and 161.8% point to targets quite accurately.
[EUR/USD][1]’s quotes may continue falling to 1.056, 1.0485 and 1.03 if
the combination of parent and child Expanding wedges works.

 **Potential of EUR/USD’s descending movement**

This pattern is not the only configuration where a pattern fits into
another pattern. The same can happen to three little Indians or 1-2-3. I
think that an inside pattern’s formation is a clear signal to open a
position. Still, don’t forget that trading is subject to variation.
Place protective orders to better control the situation.
