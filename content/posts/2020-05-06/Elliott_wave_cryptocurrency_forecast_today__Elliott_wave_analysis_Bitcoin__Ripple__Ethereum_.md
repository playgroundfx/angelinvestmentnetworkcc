The long-term corrective wave finished as a triple zigzag
[w]-[x]-[y]-[x]-[z] within the simple zigzag A-B-C. The market is now
moving down in the impulse wave. There should have finished the first
two segments of this impulse wave, the sub-waves 1 and 2. Wave 1 is an
impulse, wave 2 is a plain upward zigzag. The price should be declining
in the third wave in the few next days.

After the corrective wave B completed as a triple zigzag, the market has
turned down and there is now developing a new downtrend. There is likely
to have completed the bear wave 1 as an impulse, and the upward
correction 2, which is a simple zigzag [a]-[b]-[c]. There is now
developing the third wave, with its two sub-waves, waves [1] and [2],
completed inside. Therefore, the market should continue declining for
some time.
