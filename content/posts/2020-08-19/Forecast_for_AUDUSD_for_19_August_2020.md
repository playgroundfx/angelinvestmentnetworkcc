Forecast for AUS/AUD: Aussie is tough but fairDmitri Demidenko

## Fundamental oil forecast for Australian dollar for today

### Australian currency’s rate is close to its fair price

Don’t cry over the spilled milk! The Australian dollar’s fast growth
from March’s low levels causes trouble to the country’s export-oriented
economy and prevents inflation from reaching its target value. But even
if Philip Lowe prefers a lower rate level, he admits that currency
interventions won’t help resolve the issue. They are efficient only when
a currency’s value is far from the fundamental one, which isn’t the case
now. A faster recovery of Australia’s GDP, compared with its global
peers, and the commodity market’s impetuous growth let us think that the
AUD is close to its fair value.

[AUD/USD][1]’s bulls were concerned about the outbreak of COVID-19 in
the state of Victoria and Beijing’s discontent with Canberra’s
assumptions about the lab origins of coronavirus. Much time has passed
since then. China has calmed down, even if its anger sometimes rises
again, like in case of the anti-dumping inquiry into Australian wine
imports. As for the Australian economy, some Australian states help out
by working twice as hard. The employment rate dynamics proves that very
well. July’s figures increased by 114.7 thousand against a forecast of
+30 thousand. What a pleasant surprise!

The GDP’s recovery will certainly be a bumpy ride, but the Reserve Bank
doesn’t need to correct the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) in these circumstances. The
forward market doesn’t expect the cash rate to decrease while the yield
curve control allows the RBA to save “ammunition”. Interestingly, the
divergence in the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) has pushed [AUD/NZD][2] quotes to two-
year highs. Unlike Canberra, Wellington doesn’t exclude a further
decrease in borrowing costs, as swaps indicate the NZ cash rate will
have fallen by 40 base points by July 2021, and it is therefore more
aggressive concerning QE.

###  RBA and RBNZ rate outlooks

As a result, HSBC and Credit Agricole forecast [AUD/NZD][2]’s growth to
1.13 by the end of 2020 and by July 2021, respectively; Westpac expects
a level of 1.14 within a few months; Commonwealth Bank of Australia
recommends opening long positions with  a target of 1.19.

[AUD/USD][1]’s rally is about the USD’s weakness too. The latter is
being sold marketwide.  Investors believe the US economy will feel badly
amidst COVID-19 and the impasse in the political talks. It will force
the Fed to continue softening the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). The greenback has
lost preference it got during the US-China trade war. Even if the war
resumes, the US dollar will hardly grow stronger. In such circumstances,
there’s a higher risk that central banks diversify their gold/forex
reserves in favour of other G10 currencies.

I think, the uptrends in [AUD/USD][1] and [AUD/NZD][2] will continue.
Breakouts of resistance levels at 0.7285 and 1.1015 will allow bulls to
build up old longs or open new long positions. At the same time, the
previous [targets][4] haven’t been cancelled yet.
