Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

The oil short-term trend has turned down, and the price gap has been
closed. Yesterday there was a breakout of the oil short-term uptrend key
support [65.58 - 65.36].

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

The oil short-term trend has turned down, and the price gap has been
closed. Yesterday there was a breakout of the oil short-term uptrend key
support [65.58 - 65.36]. Today it is suitable to sell oil with the
target at Target Zone [63.32 - 62.87]. The trend reversed down.

Now the price is testing the resistance [65.72 - 65.36]. Consider sales
in this zone according to the pattern. If the correction continues, the
second zone to enter sell trades will become the new trend border [66.96
- 66.73].

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

Starting Monday, new margin requirements apply for gold futures on the
CME Group. The new maintenance margin is $10,000. All margin zones
formed from extremes since March 8 must be built according to new
requirements.

Yesterday, the resistance zone [1718 - 1710] had worked out for gold.
The local low had been updated. Then the price moved as close as
possible to Target Zone 2 [1675 - 1665].

The short-term trend remains down for today. Additional Zone is shifting
to the [1704 - 1701] zone. The trend border moves to the [1731 - 1726]
zone.

If AZ is reached within the correction, then consider sales according to
the pattern in order to update yesterday's low and reach TZ 2. If the
resistance level of 1713 is broken out, consider purchases up to the
Intermediary Zone.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

  1. Open sell positions according to the pattern in [1713 - 1704]. TakeProfit: 1677, Target Zone 2 [1675 - 1665]. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. If the price breaks out the level of [1713 - 1704], buy. TakeProfit: Intermediary Zone [1731 - 1726]. StopLoss: beyond the level of 1704.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

The euro price fall temporarily stopped in the Gold Zone 2 [1.1842 -
1.1834], which was reached today at the Asian trading session. Now the
price is correcting, but the short-term downtrend continues. The closest
correction targets are the resistances Additional Zone [1.1879 - 1.1875]
and the Intermediary Zone [1.1923 - 1.1915]. The latter is the trend
border.
