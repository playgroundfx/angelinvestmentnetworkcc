Euro is to find a way out. Forecast as of 09.03.2021Dmitri Demidenko

The ECB's actions are different from the words, and the adoption of the
$1.9-trillion stimulus from Joe Biden in the House of Representatives
could suspend Treasuries' sales. Will it support the euro? Let us
discuss the Forex outlook and make up a [EURUSD][1] trading plan.

## Weekly euro fundamental forecast

If you have a will, you will find a way. The ECB, stating its
willingness to interfere and suspend the euro-area bond yield rally that
negatively affects the European economy, has been reducing the volume of
asset purchases for the second consecutive week. In the week ended March
5, the net purchases amounted to €11.9 billion; a week earlier, the ECB
bought €12 billion. The average purchase pace since the PEPP start has
been €18.1 billion per week. The European central bank tries to explain
the latter figures with massive redemption amounts. However, if there is
a will, they will find a way, won’t they?

The discrepancy between words and facts suggests that the Governing
Board meeting on March 11 will not be as dovish as the market expects.
This circumstance may support the [EURUSD][1], as the ECB's negative
influence has been priced to a great extent. Moreover, the rise in the
euro-area bond yields doesn’t worsen the financial conditions in the
euro area much, and the recent drop in the euro exchange rate suggests
the inflation rate should increase.

To the disappointment of the [EURUSD][1] bulls, the European Central
Bank is not the only player in the city, and neither is it the most
powerful one. Without a break in the US Treasury yields, the dollar
buyers will hardly be discouraged. Investors need strong arguments to
justify why an 8%-10% expansion in US GDP in the first quarter should
not strengthen the greenback.

Expecting the US economic rebound, asset managers are selling treasuries
and technology stocks and buying equity securities in banking and energy
sectors, which are likely to experience explosive growth along with GDP.
As a result, the [Dow Jones][2] breaks through intraday highs, and the
[Nasdaq Composite][3] has tumbled into the bearish market, dropping 10%
from its February 12 record highs. This kind of divergence in the stock
indices’ trends has not occurred since 1993.

In [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of the debt market, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s still don't seem to understand
how the Fed's average inflation targeting [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) works. They are not
willing to get rid of TIPS, which provide clearer Fed [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) signals
than their counterparts without inflation protection.

### Dynamics of TIPS yields

 _Source_ _: Wall Street Journal_

Jerome Powell and his fellow central-bankers believe that the consumer
price spike will be temporary. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has the
same opinion; she noted that the Fed has the tools to act if something
goes wrong. The market continues to trade reflation, especially since
the House of Representatives may approve the $1.9 fiscal stimulus plan
on March 10.

### Weekly [EURUSD][1] trading plan

I suppose the fiscal stimulus adoption could suspend the Treasury sales.
Markets grow on the rumors and fall on the facts; the same applies to
the US Treasuries. The [EURUSD][1] reached the target at 1.185
[indicated earlier][4]. The market could stop falling and find support
in the zone of 1.18-1.185.
