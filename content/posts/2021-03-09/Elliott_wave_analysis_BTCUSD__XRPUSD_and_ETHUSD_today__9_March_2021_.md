Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 09.03.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

Today, Bitcoin and Ethereum should complete the linking up waves. Next,
the market will start declining.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

The BTCUSD market continues forming the middle part of the double zigzag
[W]-[X]-[Y], the linking wave [X]. Wave [X] is a simple zigzag
(A)-(B)-(C), which is still unfolding. There is developing the fifth
wave of the bullish impulse wave (C). The price could soon reach the
level of 54500.00, where the entire linking wave [X] should end. Next,
the market should turn down and start declining in the final motive wave
[Y].

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 52895.00, TP 54500.00

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

The XRPUSD pair continues forming the final corrective down wave as a
simple zigzag [A]-[B]-[C]. The impulse down waves [A] has finished; its
final leg is an ending diagonal. The price is now moving the corrective
bullish wave [B]. The [B] correction should be a standard
zigzag(A)-(B)-(C). The (B) wave should end soon, and the price will be
rising in the (C) impulse towards level 0.520. AT the indicated level,
wave [B] will be 50% of the impulse wave [A].

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] today:

Buy 0.474, TP 0.520

## Elliott wave Ethereum analysis

The hourly ETHUSD price chart displays a downtrend developing. There
must be forming a bearish double zigzag W-X-Y. The first leg of this
zigzag, sub-wave W, has finished. The market is now rising in the
linking wave X, which should end soon. Sub wave (5) of the [C] impulse
is currently forming. The price could go up to a level of 1883.00. Next,
the Ethereum price trend should turn down and start forming bearish wave
Y as outlined in the chart. At the indicated level, the impulse wave [C]
will be 123.6% of wave [A].

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Buy 1836.49, TP 1883.00
