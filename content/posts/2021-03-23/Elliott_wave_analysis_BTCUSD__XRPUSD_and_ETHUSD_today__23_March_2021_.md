Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 23.03.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

Bitcoin and Ethereum are forming the final legs of large corrective
waves, so the prices should be declining over the next few days.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

The BTCUSD market is moving down. It might suggest there is forming wave
4 of a larger degree. Therefore, wave 4 could drive the price to a level
of 49000. This wave is a zigzag composed of the sub-waves [A]-[B]-[C].
Wave [A] has completed as an impulse, correction [B] is a double zigzag.
The [C] impulse is currently unfolding. Today and in the next few days,
the market should be declining in waves (3)-(4)-(5) of this impulse, as
it is outlined in the chart. One could enter sell trades.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Sell 53363.00, TP 49000.00

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

The Ripple is forming a complex pattern, mainly composed of sideways
waves. There is now developing wave [Y] as a simple zigzag. A small
impulse (A) has completed, correction (B) has finished as a sideways
double three, and the (C) impulse is currently unfolding. Impulse (C) is
composed of the sub-waves 1-2-3-4-5, with the corrective wave 4
currently developing inside. Wave 4 should end as a zigzag or flat at a
level marked by the low of wave [a], 0.534. Next, the price could start
rising in impulse 5. Therefore, one could enter short trades in the
current situation.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] today:

Sell 0.563, TP 0.534

* * *

## Elliott wave Ethereum analysis

The Ethereum market, like Bitcoin, is declining. It could be forming the
beginning of the large impulse down wave [C], which is the final leg of
the bearish zigzag [A]-[B]-[C]. This zigzag is a part of wave Y of the
double zigzag (4). Therefore, over the next few days, the ETHUSD price
should be declining to a level of 1286.00. It is relevant to enter sell
trades in the current situation.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Sell 1672.16, TP 1286.00
