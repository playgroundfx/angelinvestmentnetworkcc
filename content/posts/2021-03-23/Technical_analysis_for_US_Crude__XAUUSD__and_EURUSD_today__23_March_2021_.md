## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

Yesterday, the Additional Zone 60.63 - 60.52 was tested within the
short-term uptrend. Traders broke through the local high. At least this
way, it was possible to profit from purchases according to the pattern.

Now the price is correcting again and testing the new Additional Zone
60.87 - 60.76. There is an important technical support level 60.63 near
this zone. Holding the level will allow considering new purchases with a
target at yesterday's high.

The breakout of the support at 60.63 will allow oil sales with the
target at ​​the Intermediary Zone 59.74 - 59.51. The trend's border is
situated near ​​the level of 59.36.

For gold, the trading range is narrowing to the levels 1745 - 1729. The
short-term trend remains up. Now the price is trading in a correction
slightly above the Additional Zone 1730 - 1728. The trend's first target
is to test the level of 1755. The second target is the Target Zone 1786
- 1776.

For purchases, wait for the breakout of the resistance level 1745. For
sales, wait for the breakout of the support at 1729.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

The euro short-term uptrend continues, the target of which is the Target
Zone 1.2011 - 1.1995. The Intermediary Zone - the trend border - was
held by traders. Hold purchases according to the “double bottom” pattern
that formed yesterday. It is also possible to enter purchases from the
level of 1.1910, if the market gives such an opportunity.

Selling the euro requires a breakout of the support at 1.1881. This will
allow prices to decline to the area of the lower Target Zone 1.1830 -
1.1814. The level of March low 1.1838 is situated near this zone.
