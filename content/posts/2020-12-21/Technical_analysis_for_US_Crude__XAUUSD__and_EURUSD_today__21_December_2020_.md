Short-term forecast for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 21.12.2020Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for day traders.

Euro opened with a gap today. However, all trends remain up so far.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

Last week Target Zone 3 [49.62 - 49.11] was reached in the medium-term
uptrend. This event caused exiting purchases by major traders and the
opening of sales in the correction.

Now oil is testing the trend line - a strong support level. We are
looking for purchases at the trend line according to the pattern. If
this level is broken out, we will sell oil with the target at the low of
last week and the trend key support [55.67 - 44.20].

The short-term oil uptrend continues. Now the price is trading in the
correction. This morning, the first support level at the trendline has
been broken out. Additional Zone [48.23 - 48.12] has also been broken
out.

Today I recommend considering oil sales according to the “false
breakout” pattern in the zone [48.74 - 48.62] with the target at the
trend key support [47.05 - 46.81].

After the trend key support test, we will observe the reaction of
traders.

### [USCrude ][1]trading ideas for today:

Sell from the zone [48.74 - 48.62]. TakeProfit: Intermediary Zone [47.05
- 46.81]. StopLoss: 49.19.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

Last week, gold reached the key resistance of the middle-term downtrend
[1890.8 - 1879.3]. The zone has not been broken out, so entering sales
according to the pattern is a priority option for this week's work.

If we see a breakout of the zone and the price fixing above the level
during two US sessions, then the medium-term priority will change to
buying. The target for this option will be Target Zone 2 [2005.8 -
1994.3].

Let's look at the chart of a shorter timeframe and analyze the short-
term trend. We see that it is up. Friday's high has been updated today.
If traders manage to consolidate above TZ, we will set the next growth
target at Gold Zone [1934.3 - 1929.3].

Today, I recommend looking for gold purchases according to the Price
Action patterns at the trend line. As a target, we focus on [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) high.
The margin zone, which is the closest support to the price, is at
[1881.8 - 1879.2].

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

Buy at the trendline according to the pattern. TakeProfit: 1906.0.
StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

The EURUSD traders managed to reach the strong resistance zone of Target
Zone 3 [1.2232 – 1.2212] last week. At one US session, bulls managed to
consolidate the price above the zone. One more consolidation is needed
to break out the level.

Now the price has gone into correction and broke out the trend line. The
likely downside target is the local low of last week at 1.2125.

Let's move on to a chart of the shorter timeframe and analyze the short-
term trend. We see that the zone of the uptrend key support [1.2180 -
1.2171] has just been tested. We are waiting for the reaction of traders
and looking for a pattern to enter a long trade. The buying target is to
break through the high of last week.

If the Intermediary Zone is broken out with consolidation during the US
trading session, the short-term trend will turn down. In this case,
enter Euro sales on the correction according to the patterns with a
target at the lower Target Zone [1.2088 - 1.2070].

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

Buy according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone [1.2180 - 1.2171].
TakeProfit: 1.2270. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.
