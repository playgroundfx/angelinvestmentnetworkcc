Dollar plays Mafia. EURUSD forecast 21.12.2020Dmitri Demidenko

At a time when liquidity in financial markets is falling on the eve of
Christmas and uncertainty is growing, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s' interest in the US
currency is returning. Let's talk about it and create a trading plan for
[EURUSD][1].

## Monthly US dollar fundamental forecast

Uncertainty is an integral part of our life. Financial markets cannot
exist without it. This is why [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s return to the US dollar from
time to time. Fish stuck in the nets of Brexit - let's sell [GBPUSD][2];
a new strain of COVID-19 is discovered in Britain and it spreads 70%
faster than the previous one - let's buy the greenback; it's hard to
tell how Congress will vote on the fiscal stimulus issue - time to
return to the dollar. Uncertainty is not the only factor supporting the
dollar. It is likely that the markets oversold it.

Although congressional leaders managed to negotiate about $900 billion
in fiscal stimulus, the second-largest aid package in US [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) after
the $2.2 trillion one in March, how the Senate and the House of
Representatives will vote on December 21 is yet unknown. The stumbling
block is the Fed's emergency lending programs. Democrats accuse
Republicans of creating obstacles to the fiscal deal, and a potential
clash could lead to the project being rejected.

The new strain of COVID-19 discovered in Britain is even greater
uncertainty, forcing London to impose additional restrictions, and more
than ten European countries to stop letting in tourists from Britain.
While epidemiologists say that there is no connection between it and
increased mortality rates and that vaccines may still work in the face
of a new threat, but what if this is not the case? The entire plan to
defeat the pandemic and rapidly restore global GDP in 2021 could go down
the drain.

The uncertainty surrounding Brexit hasn't gone away at all. Boris
Johnson needs clarification on the new EU fisheries proposal, he
believes that the discussed financial aid package is unbalanced and will
allow the EU to issue more subsidies than Britain, and Minister for the
Cabinet Office Michael Gove argues that London and Brussels will be
forced to conclude not one big deal but a few small agreements. The
clock is ticking, time is running out, the pound is falling, dragging
[EURUSD][1] down with it.

Investors are not sure whether the Fed will begin to tighten monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) in 2021. Yes, the FOMC forecasts suggest that rates are unlikely
to rise before 2024, but there is also an emergency purchase program.
Will the rise of inflation expectations, inspired by the current oil
price rally, be the reason for the reduction in the scale of QE?

Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan would prefer to start cutting down on
bond purchases if GDP grows rapidly. Long QE creates problems, he says.
It distorts financial markets and creates conditions for imbalances that
will be difficult to manage.

### Monthly [EURUSD][3] trading plan

As expected, the [EURUSD][1] pair couldn't hold above the 1.224-1.2245
level, while increased uncertainty increases the likelihood of
consolidation in the range of 1.196-1.226. That is unless the vote in
the US Congress goes off perfectly and the Brexit problems are resolved
successfully in the last minute.
