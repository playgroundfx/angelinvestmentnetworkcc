Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 21.12.2020Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I suggest entry signals
to trade each cryptocurrency.

For XRPUSD and ETHUSD, a slight decline is expected in corrective sub-
waves, after which an impulse rise is possible.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

 ****

We see the BTCUSD market rising in an impulse trend. Most likely, a
corrective wave (4), consisting of sub-waves A-B-C, has recently been
formed, then we saw a rise in price in the initial part of the final
wave (5). Impulse 1 and correction 2 were built to this impulse. Now the
final section of impulse wave 3 is forming. In the near future, sub-
waves (3)-(4)-(5) will rise to the level of 26000.00, as shown in the
chart.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 23689.00 TP 26000.00

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

 ****

A large bullish impulse is developing in the XRPUSD market, in which the
upward impulse wave [3] has been completed recently. This was followed
by a correctional wave [4]. Judging by the initial part, correction [4]
takes the form of a horizontal contracting triangle. Recently, the first
sub-wave (a) of this triangle has been completed, it took the form of a
double zigzag. Currently, we see a rise in sub-wave (b), which may take
the form of a standard a-b-c zigzag. Most likely, the bearish correction
b will be completed in the area of ​​0.539, after which a rise in
impulse c is possible to the area above the level of 0.656 (the high
formed by impulse a).

### Trading plan for **[XRPUSD][2]** today:

Buy 0.558, TP 0.656

## Elliott wave Ethereum analysis

 ****

On the H1 timeframe of ETHUSD, there is an upward impulse wave (3), in
which the first four parts have been fully completed, and now the final
fifth wave is forming. Wave 5 is a bullish impulse consisting of sub-
waves [1]-[2]-[3]-[4]-[5]. Most likely, a horizontal correction [4] is
developing now, it takes the form of a double three (w)-(x)-(y).
Perhaps, we will see it completed in the area of ​​the previous low,
which was formed by wave (w), that is, near the level of 624.00. Then,
the cryptocurrency pair is expected to rise above the level of 677.00 in
wave [5], as indicated in the chart.

### Trading plan for  **[ETHUSD][3] **today:

Buy 643.42, TP 677.00
