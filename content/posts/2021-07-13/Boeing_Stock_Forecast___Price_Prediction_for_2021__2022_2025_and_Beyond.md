Boeing Stock Forecast: 2021 and BeyondJana Kane

Boeing, which is short for The Boeing Company, is an American aerospace company founded by William Edward Boeing. The [Boeing stock][1] (ticker symbol BA) recently received a lot of publicity because of the coronavirus crisis and the 777 engine fire. In [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of turnover, Boeing is one of the largest aircraft manufacturers worldwide and the second in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of delivered aircraft. The aviation giant is included in one of the major US indices, the S&P 500 index (however, it isn’t listed on the Nasdaq 100 index).  Are you interested in investing and buying Boeing stocks? In this article, we talk about the [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) of Boeing shares and the Boeing stock price prediction.

## Boeing (BA): a Recent History

Boeing knows better than anyone where the future of aviation lies. It is
not without reason that it [invested $20 million][2] in Virgin Galactic,
Richard Branson's company that wants to make space travel commercially
accessible. This investment shows that Boeing is not holding back but is
thinking about the future. Whether they will ever participate in Virgin
Galactic's mission and start producing spacecraft themselves is unknown.

Boeing is not a short-term investment and belongs in a long-term
portfolio. Boeing is working hard on the improvement of the 737; the
company wants to dethrone Airbus again. When the dividend also returns,
Boeing's valuation will only increase.

### Dividends

Boeing first paid a dividend in 1937 and then continuously from 1942
until 2019. After the coronavirus crisis in 2020, as did other aviation
companies, the company subsequently [announced][3] that there wouldn't
be dividend payments for the next 3 to 5 years. Although Boeing has
always looked after [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s, with an average dividend of about 2.5%,
this decision shows that Boeing is committed to its “health.” They chose
to temporarily get "back in shape" to be a top condition again in the
long term.

The Boeing Company is one of those companies that has benefited greatly
from globalization, the cumulative growth of the Chinese middle class,
and the booming aviation business since the early 2000s. Therefore, the
stock is found in many stock portfolios, but the company was hit hard
during the coronavirus crisis.

Recently, Boeing was in another bad situation – there was an [engine
fire in a Boeing 777][4] aircraft. This [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) affected stocks, and the
Boeing price dropped again. The plane caught fire over a residential
area of Denver, Colorado. It lost some debris that ended up in the
residential areas, and [the video][5] of the burning engine went viral.

Ultimately, the Boeing course quickly rose when it turned out that
everything had turned out well. After the fire, Boeing immediately
advised grounding all Boeing 777 aircraft with the same engines. The 128
aircraft in question are only allowed to fly again once an investigation
of the fire cause has been completed. For this investigation, Boeing and
the other airlines depend on the American aviation authority FAA.

After the dividend was also cut due to the pandemic, many [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s were
left wondering whether it was still valuable to take a position in
Boeing. We are here to tell you that Boeing can "take off" further in
the coming years.

### One of the Most Important Companies in the World

That sounds quite daring, but it's not an exaggeration. Boeing is a
pivotal figure in the tourism sector, which is sometimes called the
"largest industry in the world." This isn’t because of turnover, for
example, but because of employment. The tourism sector provided no less
than 20% of jobs worldwide between 2013 and 2020.

[Boeing][1] also develops aircraft, helicopters, and drones for the US
Department of Defense. After Social Security, defense in America is the
second-largest item in the federal budget, with a budget of no less than
$934 billion from October 2020 to September 2021. Boeing also developed
the well-known Airforce One.

Because Boeing is the second-largest aircraft supplier (Airbus being the
first), they are an indispensable part of our society. Hence, it's not
surprising that Boeing, one of the most important companies globally,
cannot be replaced on a whim. The Boeing stock outlook is optimistic.

## Boeing Stock Now: Current Price

Today on 14.07.2021, the BA stock is traded at $228.19. You can refer to
this article to see the Boeing stock price tomorrow. Below is an
interactive BA-to-dollar price chart that shows the BA stock rate for
buying and selling:

## Boeing Stock Predictions for 2021: Expert Forecasts

At the beginning of April 2021, 24 Wall Street analysts, including The
Goldman Sachs Group, Bloomberg, Credit Suisse, Morgan Stanley, and the
USB Group, [have issued][6] ratings and price targets for Boeing this
year. Their median twelve-month Boeing price target is 260 US dollars,
with a high estimate of 310 US dollars and a low estimate of 165 US
dollars. The current consensus among the polled investment analysts is
to buy stock in Boeing Co. This rating hasn’t changed since March 2021.

## Boeing Stock Technical Analysis

Let's do a technical analysis of [the Boeing][1] stock chart (NYSE: BA).
First, we should study the price [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) in the monthly time frame to
identify global trends and key levels.

There's a stable bullish trend in the market that started in the 2000s.
The corrective movement of the [Boeing][7] share price from late 2019 to
early 2020, associated with the beginning of the pandemic, broke out a
multi-year trend line.

However, the BA price [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) in the technical chart showed that the
breakout was false. Nonetheless, it was a strong bearish signal that
undermines the reliability of the blue trendline as a support level.

There is a decline in trading volumes against the backdrop of the latest
price rise wave. Therefore, I dare to predict that the intensity of the
bullish impulse will soon decrease or that the bullish trend will
reverse, as the likelihood is quite high.

Another important point to pay attention to while making Boeing
predictions is the nearest resistance levels for the bulls.

The Boeing chart above shows that the $290 to $320 trade zone hasn’t
been broken out for over two years. Now, this same area is a serious
obstacle to the fulfillment of bullish potential for projected growth.
The very fact that the price has already got close enough to these
levels indicates an approaching bearish correction.

### Boeing Forecast For Next Three Months

Let's do a technical analysis of the weekly chart to estimate Boeing
stock prospects for the near future.

The weekly chart of [Boeing][7] stock above shows the market price in
local consolidation as part of a two-year bullish trend. Taking into
account Boeing current trend, in the coming months, expect an approach
to the dotted trend line, which will largely determine Boeing future
value and Boeing potential price target.

After analyzing the MACD, it is clear that there is a classic bearish
divergence between the price chart and the indicator, with the latter
entering the negative zone. This is an early bearish signal which serves
as a clear sign that Boeing rate should decline.

The most realistic Boeing future price predictions for the next few
months suggest the price should break out the support at 220 US dollars
(red line in the chart). This event will determine Boeing stock trend
for the entire 2021.

If the bearish attack fails, the potential bullish movement of the
[Boeing][1] stock price should retest the resistance zone of 290 USD —
320 USD.

Based on Boeing Analysis, I would not recommend entering short trades
right away. It is safer to expect a sell signal, such as a breakout of
the previous low at 219 USD. If there is a bullish breakout, one should
wait until the price consolidates above 320 USD and high trade volumes
confirm the growth.

### Long-Term Boeing Technical Analysis for 2021

Let us outline Boeing projected stock price changes for the entire 2021
and define the expected Boeing trading range for each next month of the
year.

There are no trend reversal signals, so there could soon start a short-
term correction. The correction should be followed by a growth wave. The
bullish price movement must continue up to the resistance zone of $290 —
$320. The uptrend might not be strong enough to break out the resistance
zone in the short-term outlook.

Therefore, the most likely scenario suggests the BA price should be
moving in cycles within the trading range between 220 USD and 320 USD
until the end of 2021. The price movements beyond the channel will be
determined by the breakouts of the range borders. It is important that
when the price goes outside the channel, there should be high trade
volumes and a strong momentum with the price consolidation in the weekly
or, which is even better, monthly timeframe.

The table below displays the projected ranges for the [Boeing][1] stock
price moves for each month of 2021. The projection is based on the width
of Bollinger bands.

## How Did the Boeing Stock Price Change Over Time?

We can’t predict with certainty what the [BA stock price][1] will be in
the next 10 years, but we can look back at the price [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/). This can
help us make more reliable predictions. Below is a [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) timeline
that shows how the price of the BA stock changed over the past 10 years:

## Factors That May Affect the Boeing Stock Price

Various factors may affect the BA stock price. Below are five important
factors that any BA trader or [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) should analyze.

### Factor 1 - Reputation

This commercial aircraft manufacturer undoubtedly owes its success to
the quality and reputation of its aircraft. Therefore, all events that
could affect this data, such as the release of new aircraft and
incidents such as accidents or significant technical problems, should be
monitored.

### Factor 2 - News

While in reality, Boeing has only one direct competitor, Airbus, it is
important to keep a close eye on all significant Airbus publications and
[news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) that directly impact the company's share price.

### Factor 3 – Financial Data

Of course, you should also take an interest in this company's financial
data by carefully studying the aircraft manufacturer's order book and
quarterly and annual figures.

### Factor 4 – Industry Outlook

The activities of the major airlines in the world are also important
indicators of the stock. After all, Boeing's sales depend directly on
the financial outlook of this industry.

### Factor 5 - Partnerships

Finally, we should follow the operations that the group has set up with
other companies, such as creating joint ventures, partnerships, and
other activities aimed at the development of the activities and the
group's growth.

## What Is the Future of Boeing Stocks? Are Boeing Stocks a Good
Investment?

As an [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/), you look to the future. [Boeing][1] is not a short-term
investment and belongs in the long-term portfolio. Boeing is working
hard to improve the 737. When the dividend distribution returns,
Boeing's valuation is expected to increase further. Unfortunately, due
to the coronavirus crisis, the dividend was severely cut. Because Boeing
(together with Airbus) is the largest aircraft supplier, it is, in fact,
indispensable to our society.

Boeing is one of the world's largest companies and cannot easily be
replaced. Analysts are very optimistic about the Boeing stock. When you
buy Boeing shares, you buy relatively stable shares that can return
during this time. This is what the Boeing stock price prediction chart
looks like for 2021:

In the short term, it is, of course, always possible that setbacks will
arise in the Boeing price, so be careful and do your research. In the
longer term, investing in Boeing shares definitely looks like an
investment that will pay off. Confidence in Boeing seems to be
recovering when it is possible to fly again without restrictions; the
company can retake its steps.

Boeing looks like an investment with a good chance of a decent return in
the near future. However, it is always a question of the recent
developments and how the company (and the market) will get out of the
current dire economic situation.
