Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 13.07.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

The three cryptocurrency pairs covered in the article should start
declining in prices. There are developing the final leg of corrective
patterns. Let us study each cryptocurrency in detail.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

The BTCUSD market must be forming an upward double zigzag. The up wave
(W) has completed as a simple zigzag A-B-C. There is unfolding the
linking wave (X) as a triple zigzag W-X-Y-X-Z. The final sub-wave Z has
been half-complete within the zigzag. The price should soon start
declining to a level of 31800.00, where wave (X) will reach the 61.8%
Fibonacci retracement of wave (W).

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Sell 33109.50, TP 31800.00

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

The XRPUSD market must be forming the double zigzag W-X-Y. The first
motive sub-wave W has completed. There is unfolding the final leg of the
linking wave X, which is developing as a triple zigzag
[W]-[X]-[Y]-[X]-[Z]. The Ripple price should be declining in the [Z]
wave to a level of 0.560, where wave X will retrace the W wave by 76.4%.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] **** today:

Sell 0.627, TP 0.560

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

The ETHUSD market has started forming a new upward pattern. There must
be developing a simple bullish zigzag [A]-[B]-[C]. Wave [A] looks
complete. The corrective wave [B] should also finish soon. The Ethereum
price should soon be declining in the (C) impulse to a level of 1960.00.
At this level wave [B] will be 61.8% of wave [A]. After the above-
mentioned level is reached, the market could turn up and start rising.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Sell 2019.52, TP 1960.00
