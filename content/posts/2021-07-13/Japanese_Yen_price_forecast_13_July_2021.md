Yen: remarkable success is over. Forecast as of 13.07.2021Dmitri
Demidenko

In July, the yen suddenly turned from an outsider into a leader in
Forex. Why did this happen? How long will it last? Let us discuss this
question and make up a [USDJPY][1] trading plan

## Weekly yen fundamental analysis

The first decade of July was extremely successful for the Japanese yen.
The spread of the Delta variant across the planet, the associated doubts
that the global economic recovery will not be as rapid as everyone
expects, capital flight from risk and high demand for funding currencies
contributed to the fall of [USDJPY][1] to monthly lows. The [Nikkei
225][2] rollback, the fall of Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga's approval
rating and the declaration of a state of emergency in Tokyo also
exacerbated the correction. However, it is too early to talk about a
USDJPY trend reversal.

I have repeatedly noted that the [USDJPY][1] uptrend is based on
divergences in economic growth and monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) and the associated
capital flow from Asia to America. Alas, the decline in US Treasury
yields slows down this process, allowing the yen to strengthen against
the greenback from time to time. Treasury rates are falling due to fears
that the Fed's withdrawing of QE earlier than originally anticipated,
new COVID-19 variants, supply chain disruptions and labor market
problems will slow the pace of US GDP growth.

At the same time, the US dollar retained its main advantages. The
overwhelming majority of Bloomberg experts believe that in the
foreseeable future, the Bank of Japan will keep negative rates and the
asset purchase program unchanged. 80% of economists predict that the
Japanese central bank will start the withdrawal of monetary stimulus no
earlier than 2022. The Fed may raise rates by then. Markets are awaiting
the Fed report on a QE reduction in August-September.

If divergence in monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) is based on different inflation rates,
then the divergence in economic growth between the United States and
Japan should be associated with successes and failures in the fight
against COVID-19. In the United States, 48% of the adult population has
been fully vaccinated, in Japan only 18%. Because of this, the rating of
Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga has fallen from 37% to 34% over the past
month, which increases political uncertainty ahead of the elections, and
also provides short-term support for [USDJPY][1] bears. Moreover, the
[Nikkei 225][2] is also trying to enter the bear market, testing a 10%
retracement level of the February highs.

Thus, the foundation of the [USDJPY][1] uptrend remains solid, while
one-time factors contribute to the pair's correction. Falling Treasury
yields and high fundamental estimates of the [S&P 500][3] make Japanese
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s think hard and buy US-issued securities. However,
overestimations don't meet the market's expectations, but make it
vulnerable in case of unpleasant surprises.

### Weekly [USDJPY][1] trading plan

In my opinion, the current [USDJPY][1] pullback provides an excellent
opportunity to enter longs at an attractive price. Further acceleration
of inflation in the USA may become an informational reason for entering
long trades. At the same time, a breakout of resistance at 110.5 will
increase the risks of the rally continuation.
