Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 21.07.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

Gold is trading between two strong levels.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

Yesterday, oil trades in the Additional Zone 66.98 - 66.82 yielded
profits. As a result, July 19 low was updated. Then the price went into
correction. A new Additional Zone 66.43 - 66.30 was broken out at the US
trading session.

Now the oil price continues to trade in a correction to the short-term
downtrend. The zone of ​​67.06 - 67.90 serves as key resistance for
today. While the area is being held by sellers, consider oil sales with
a target at yesterday's low.

If the resistance area is broken out, the short-term trend will reverse
up, and the target will be the upper Target Zone 70.80 - 70.27.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

Open sell positions according to the pattern in 67.06 - 67.90.
TakeProfit: 65.00. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

Gold is trading between two strong levels. Above is the resistance level
of 1819 - 1817. This is the Intermediary Margin Zone, which serves as
the border of the short-term downtrend. Below is the support level of
1811 - 1809.

To determine the priority for short-term trading, either a breakout of
the resistance level with consolidation above or a breakout of the
support level with consolidation below is required.

When buying, the target will be the upper Target Zone 1844 - 1840. When
selling, the target will be the lower Target Zone 1811 - 1809.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

  1. Buy when the Intermediary Zone 1819 - 1817 is broken out upside. TakeProfit: Target Zone 1844 - 1840. StopLoss: beyond the local low.

  2. Sell when the Intermediary Zone 1811 - 1809 is broken out downside. TakeProfit: Target Zone 1789 - 1784. StopLoss: beyond the local high.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

The EURUSD bears are trying to break out the support zone 1.1762 -
1.1753. If successful, then the price fall will continue with the target
in the Gold Zone 1.1711 - 1.1702. If the support zone is held during the
European trading session, then at the US trading session expect the
price growth in the Additional Zone 1.1804 - 1.1799, and then, when the
Additional Zone is broken out, in the Intermediary Zone 1.1852 - 1.1843.

According to the technical analysis, the border of the downtrend is
shifting to level 1.1821.
