Yen omens apocalypse. Forecast as of 21.07.2021Dmitri Demidenko

The safe-haven status in times of market turmoil allows the yen to feel
confident. Moreover, thanks to cross-currency swaps, money flows from
America and Europe to Asia. Let us discuss the Forex outlook and make up
a [USDJPY][1] trading plan

## Weekly yen fundamental analysis

When will [USDJPY][1] bears stop being heroic? The currency, whose
issuing country is facing new emergencies due to COVID-19, whose economy
is slowing and losing more and more to the US one, and the central bank
officials does not think about monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) normalization, is the
leader among the G10 in July. Is it a paradox? In fact, in Forex, many
things initially look extraordinary, but there is a logical explanation
for everything.

Monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) and economic growth can provide excellent reasons for
long-term investment. However, you need to understand that exchange
rates are determined by the capital flow. If it flows from America and
Europe to Asia, then [USDJPY][1] and [EURJPY][2] prices will most likely
fall. In early 2021, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s were counting on reflation. Rapid
economic growth in the United States and the Fed's passivity allowed
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s to sell Treasuries in the hope of a yield rally. In June, the
Fed gave up its wait-and-see approach as new strains of COVID-19 raised
doubts about the possibility of a skyrocketing US GDP. As a result, the
US Treasury bonds' short trades began to close, and yields began to
fall.

The main beneficiary was the Japanese yen, which faced both repatriation
of capital to its homeland from local [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s and the growing demand
for Japanese bonds from foreign [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s. How can the often negative
rates on Japanese debt attract Americans? The answer is simple! They
make money on cross-currency swaps. They allow you to get 50 bps more
compared to European and Australian bonds with similar maturities. The
difference with Treasuries is about 30 bps. Is it any surprise that in
June foreign [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s bought ¥4.06 trillion of Japanese bonds on a net
basis? This is the second-best result in the entire [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) of
accounting. A new record could be set in July.

Thus, the answer to the question of how long the yen will strengthen is
obvious – until the yield on US Treasuries goes up. According to Buckler
Securities, there is reason to believe that the yield has reached a
minimum. Net speculative Treasury shorts are at their lowest since April
19. It seems that the process of their closure due to the unfulfilled,
dominant in early 2021, the idea of ​​rate growth is coming to an end.
In the near future, expect a stabilization or even a rally in the yield
of 10-year US bonds, which will make the yen a Forex outsider again.

### Weekly [USDJPY][1] trading plan

New COVID-19 variants could save [USDJPY][1] bears, causing chaos in
financial markets. However, let's forget about the apocalypse. I prefer
to believe in a bright future. In this regard, I recommend entering USD
medium and long-term longs against the yen above level 110.5.
