Dollar is to wake the sleeping dog up. Forecast as of 21.07.2021Dmitri
Demidenko

[EURUSD][1] bulls do not go ahead because of concerns of the ECB dovish
tone at the July meeting. Bears a driving the pair down, slow but
steady. What’s next? Let us discuss the Forex outlook and make up a
trading plan.

## Weekly US dollar fundamental forecast

Although FOMC officials say that the Fed intends to consider the actual
data, not at the forecasts, as before, the markets buy the expectations.
Investors expect Jerome Powell to announce the tapering of the
$120-billion QE program in Jackson Hole. Therefore, traders are holding
the dollar longs and should add up to them on corrections until at least
August. The dollar is supported by monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) and benefits from
other advantages, such as high demand for safe havens and the US
economy’s exclusivity.

Given the Fed's dual mandate, when trying to anticipate changes in
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s should consider two indicators, inflation,
and employment. And there are two bits of [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) for the dollar buyers,
good and bad ones.

I will start with the good [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/). So far, the housing costs have been
rising more slowly than, for example, the prices of airline tickets,
used cars, and electricity. But the indicator in June grew to 2.6%, and
this is just the beginning. Considering the significant share of rent in
the structure of core inflation (about 33%) and CPI (about 40%), as well
as the lag behind rapidly growing home sales prices, I could suggest
that rent is a sleeping dog that is about to wake up and force the Fed
to take active steps. I mean, a longer period of high inflation will
encourage the Fed to start monetary normalization earlier than currently
expected.

### Dynamics of housing costs in USA

The bad [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) for the greenback is that the stimulus checks have already
expired in some states, but employment hasn’t grown significantly. This
conclusion was drawn by Goldman Sachs and Oxford Economics, as the June
jobs report shows the employment increase by 174,000, compared to 47,000
in the states where people still have a weekly boost of $300.
Nonetheless, I believe there is a big difference. In autumn, monthly
employment growth can be measured in figures of more than 1 million. The
recovery of the US labor market is the key to raising the federal funds
rate and strengthening the greenback.

Thus, the Fed may announce tapering the QE already in August. Due to
high inflation and the approaching state of full employment, it may
raise the federal funds rate in 2022. The ECB is far behind in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of
monetary tightening. Markets believe that after the €1.85-trillion PEPP
completes in March next year, the ECB will scale up the earlier QE; they
do not expect the deposit rate to be raised by 10 basis points earlier
than the end of 2023. Christine Lagarde announced a move to a new
symmetric inflation targeting strategy, which means the ECB officials
should sound dovish, pressing down the [EURUSD][1].

### Weekly [EURUSD][1] trading plan

ECB’s monetary expansion has led to the fact that in 2020 alone, it
bought up almost the entire volume of bonds issued by the currency bloc,
and its market share increased to 42%. The ECB will not allow debt
yields to rise as fast as the Treasury yields. This confirms the idea of
a strong [EURUSD][1] downtrend. Therefore, it is relevant to sell the
euro on the corrections with the targets at 1.1715 and 1.1665.
