Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 21.07.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

The cryptocurrency pairs, covered in the article, must have completed
bearish triple zigzags, so the prices should be rising in the new
bullish waves.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

The BTCUSD market is forming a long-term simple zigzag, with a
corrective wave [B] developing inside. The [B] wave could complete as a
double zigzag (W)-(X)-(Y). The bearish wave (X) must have finished as a
triple zigzag. Therefore, the market should be rising in the final
motive wave (Y) to a level above 34700.00, where wave X completed
earlier.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 29698.00, TP 34700.00

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

After the motive down wave (W) completed, the market has started forming
a new upwave as a double zigzag W-X-Y. Sub-wave W completed as a simple
zigzag [A]-[B]-[C]. The down wave X completed as a triple zigzag
[W]-[X]-[Y]-[X]-[Z]. The market should be rising in the final motive
wave Y to a level above 0.655, marked by the linking wave [X].

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] **** today:

Buy 0.529, TP 0.655

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

The ETHUSD is developing a simple descending zigzag, with impulse wave A
completed and correction B developing inside. Wave B is likely to have a
simple structure. The market seems to have completed the middle leg of
the B wave, correction [B] as a triple zigzag. The Ethereum price should
be rising in the [C] impulse to the previous high of 2172.00, where the
linking wave (X) finished.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Buy 1788.19, TP 2172.00
