Dollar enjoys deceiving itself. Forecast as of 13.08.2021Dmitri
Demidenko

QE tapering and a federal funds rate hike are not the only ways to
combat inflation. The Fed is actively withdrawing money from the market.
How can that affect stock indexes and the [EURUSD][1]? Let’s check it
out and make a trading plan.

## Monthly fundamental forecast for the dollar

After the [S&P 500][2]'s 47th record high close, it occurs to me more
and more often that bulls are being led to the slaughterhouse. The stock
index is growing when the economy is up on cyclical stocks and when it's
down. In the latter case, it's technological giants that grow. The index
rises amid inflation spikes as everyone believes that's a peak, and amid
inflation slowdowns, too. The [S&P 500][2] goes on rallying even if the
Fed's hawks continue saying it's time to taper QE. They say the central
bank will continue moving at a snail's pace all the same. The bubble is
blowing up, so what will happen to the [EURUSD][1] once it blows out?

Investors believe in the temporary nature of high inflation and the
Fed's slow pace. They don't doubt new fiscal relief packages will be
approved as fast as the previous ones as the Democrats control Congress.
Corporate profits and low borrowing rates impress the market, while such
factors as overassessment and the debt ceiling are considered irrelevant
and therefore neglected. There's just one factor that favors excessive
appetite for stock buying -- people have too much money. Liquidity is
too high, and [S&P 500][2] bulls should start worrying as the Fed has
started withdrawing money from the system.

The central bank's reverse repo operations reached a new record high of
$1.087 trillion on 12 August. The Fed uses this type of borrowing to
slow down money supply growth and inflation. However, financial markets
might get disturbed when M2 grows slower than GDP. At the same time,
trade volumes will most likely rise, as Treasury uses cash to avoid
breaching the debt ceiling.

### Dynamics of reverse repo operations

Inflation did slow down in July, but producer prices have been beyond
Bloomberg's expectations for the fifth consecutive month. The Fed will
not hurry to normalize monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), but QE withdrawal is just a
matter of time. Twenty-eight out of 43 Reuters experts think the central
bank will announce the beginning of their $120 billion program taper in
September. More than 30% of respondents bet on November or December.
Sixty percent of economists expect the bond-buying program will start
shrinking in Q1, 2022. The rest answered it would happen in Q4, 2021.

The likeliest scenario is curtailing bond buying by $10 billion a month,
but I think that will be faster. A drastic decrease in the budget
deficit and in Treasury's need for new borrowings will turn the Fed into
a whale in the debt market pond, provoking excessive volatility.

### Monthly trading plan for [**EURUSD**][1]

So, they continue persuading [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s that the Fed will normalize its
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) at a snail's pace while the central bank continues to actively
withdraw liquidity from the financial system. The [S&P 500][2] will
therefore correct sooner or later, and demand for the USD will grow.
Continue selling the [EURUSD][1] on the rise with targets at 1.166 and
1.158.
