EURUSD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 13.08.2021 –
20.08.2021Alex Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 1.1908 with a target of 1.1600 – 1.1489.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
1.1908 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 1.2269 –
1.2500.

 **Analysis:** Daily chart: presumably, the first wave of larger degree
1 of (3) is formed, and a downside correction continues forming as wave
2 of (3). Apparently, wave a of 2 and an ascending wave b of 2 formed on
the H4 chart, and a descending wave c of 2 is developing now. The fifth
wave of smaller degree (v) of c is developing on the H1 chart, with a
local correction developing inside in the form of wave iv of (v). If the
presumption is correct, the pair will continue to drop to the levels of
1.1600 – 1.1489. The level of 1.1908 is critical in this scenario. Its
breakout will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 1.2269
– 1.2500.
