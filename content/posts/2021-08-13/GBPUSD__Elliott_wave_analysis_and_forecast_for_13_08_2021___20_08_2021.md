GBPUSD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 13.08.2021 –
20.08.2021Alex Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions from corrections above the
level of 1.3730 with a target of 1.3983 – 1.4187.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
1.3730 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of 1.3573
– 1.3500.

 **Analysis:** the first wave of larger degree (1) finished developing
on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) chart, with wave 5 of (1) formed inside. A descending
correction appears to have formed as wave (2) on the H4 chart, with wave
C of (2) completed inside. Apparently, the third wave (3) has started
forming on the H1 chart, with the first counter-trend wave of smaller
degree i of 1 of (3) formed and a correction nearing completion as wave
ii of 1 of (3) inside. If the presumption is correct, the pair will
continue to rise to the levels of 1.3983 – 1.4187 after correction. The
level of 1.3730 is critical in this scenario as its breakout will enable
the pair to continue declining to the levels of 1.3573 – 1.3500.
