XAUUSD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 13.08.2021 –
20.08.2021Alex Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 1833.26 with a target of 1602.20 – 1490.70.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
1833.26 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 1915.00
– 2077.78.

 **Analysis:** an ascending third wave of larger degree (3) formed and a
descending correction continues developing as the fourth wave (4) on the
[daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) chart. Wave В of (4) appears to have formed on the H4 chart, and
wave C of (4) is now developing. The third wave of smaller degree iii of
C is forming on the H1 chart, with wave (iii) of iii unfolding as part
of it. If the presumption is correct, the pair will continue to drop to
the levels of 1602.20 – 1490.70. The level of 1833.26 is critical in
this scenario as a breakout will enable the pair to continue growing to
the levels of 1915.00 – 2077.78.
