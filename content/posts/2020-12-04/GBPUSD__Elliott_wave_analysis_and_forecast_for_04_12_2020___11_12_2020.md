GBPUSD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 04.12.2020 –
11.12.2020Alex Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions from corrections above the
level of 1.3286 with a target of 1.3700 – 1.3900.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
1.3286 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of 1.2910
– 1.2679.

 **Analysis:** Daily time frame: presumably, the first wave of larger
degree (1) continues developing, with wave 3 of (3) formed inside. On
the H4 time frame, there is the fifth wave 5 of (3) developing, with
wave iii of 5 forming inside. On the H1 time frame, a local correction
appears to have finished developing as wave (iv) of iii, and wave (v) of
iii is forming now. If the presumption is correct, the pair will
continue to rise to the levels of 1.3700 – 1.3900. The level of 1.3286
is critical in this scenario as its breakout will enable the pair to
continue declining to the levels of 1.2910 – 1.2679.
