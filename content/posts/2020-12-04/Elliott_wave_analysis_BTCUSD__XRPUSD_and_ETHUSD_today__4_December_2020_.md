Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 04.12.2020Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I suggest entry signals
to trade each cryptocurrency.

The market continues following the suggested scenarios. After the
corrective sub-waves completed, all cryptocurrency pairs should be
developing bullish impulses.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

 ****

The BTCUSD market continues forming the upward impulse wave C, namely
its final leg, the sub-waves [5]. Wave [5] is also an impulse. There
have completed the sub-waves (1)-(2)-(3), and there is forming the
corrective wave (4). This correction is composed of three sub-waves, it
is a zigzag. The market should decline a little in a small impulse c.
Next, we could see wave (5) conclude the bullish trend at a level of
around 20000.00.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 19282.50. TP 20000.00

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

 ****

Like the XRPUSD market is forming the powerful impulse wave C that is
composed of five sub-waves. Four legs out of five have completed within
the C wave, and wave [5] is still developing. Within impulse [5], there
is forming the middle leg, impulse wave (3). The price should decline a
little in the final leg of the corrective sub-wave 4. Next, the price
could be rising in wave 5 to a level of  0.689, as it is outlined in the
chart.

### Trading plan for **[XRPUSD][2]** today:

Buy 0.614, TP 0.689

* * *

## Elliott wave Ethereum analysis

 ****

The ETHUSD market trend is similar. There is forming the global wave C
composed of the sub-waves [1]-[2]-[3]-[4]-[5]. There is forming the
final wave [5] an impulse. The first three legs have finished within the
[5] impulse, and the correction (4) is still unfolding with the final
wave c yet to complete. The market could go down a little in the c wave.
Next, the market will be rising to a level of 665.00, as it is outlined
in the chart.

### Trading plan for  **[ETHUSD][3] **today:

Buy 604.39, TP 665.00
