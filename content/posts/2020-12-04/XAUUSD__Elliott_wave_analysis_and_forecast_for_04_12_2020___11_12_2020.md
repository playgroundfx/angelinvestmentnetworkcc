XAUUSD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 04.12.2020 -
11.12.2020Alex Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 1900.15 with a target of 1718.57 – 1606.95.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
1900.15 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 1965.30
– 2014.94.

 **Analysis:** Daily time frame: presumably, the ascending third wave of
larger degree (3) formed, and a descending correction is now developing
as wave (4). The wave of smaller degree А of (4) appears to have formed
on the H4 time frame, and a local correction finished developing as wave
В of (4). H1 time frame: there is wave C of (4) developing, with wave
iii of С formed and ascending correction nearing completion as wave iv
of C inside. If the assumption is correct, the pair will continue
falling to the levels of 1718.57 – 1606.95. The level of 1900.15 is
critical in this scenario, as the breakout will enable the pair to
continue rising to the levels of 1965.30 – 2014.94.
