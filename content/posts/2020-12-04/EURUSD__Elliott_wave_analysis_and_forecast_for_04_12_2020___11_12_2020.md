EURUSD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 04.12.2020 –
11.12.2020Alex Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions from corrections above the
level of 1.2037 with a target of 1.2250 – 1.2400.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
1.2037 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of 1.1919
– 1.1800

 **Analysis:** Daily time frame: presumably, the first wave of larger
degree 1 of (3) continues developing, with wave iii of 1 formed inside.
On the H4 time frame, a local correction has formed as the fourth wave
iv of 1, and wave v of 1 is forming. Apparently, the third wave of
smaller degree (iii) of v is forming on the H1 time frame, with wave iii
of (iii) forming inside.  If the presumption is correct, the pair will
continue to rise to the levels of 1.2250 – 1.2400.  The level of 1.2037
is critical in this scenario. Its breakout will allow the pair to
continue falling to the levels of 1.1919 – 1.1800.
