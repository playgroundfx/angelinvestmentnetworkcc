Medium-term forecast for oil, gold, and EURUSD 04.12.2020Alex Rodionov

I welcome my colleagues! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest trading
signals for traders who trade in medium-term trends.

The EURUSD bulls have broken out the Target Zone 2 [1.2032 - 1.2012] and
consolidated the price above.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for next week: USCrude analysis

The oil price continues trading in the medium-term uptrend with the
target Target Zone 3 [49.32 - 48.81]. This week, buyers have broken
through the local high of last week, Therefore, we should move the trend
key support to the zone of [41.69 – 41.22].

Next week, I recommend looking for oil purchases in the support zones.
The first support zone, according to the technical analysis, is [44.17 -
43.75]. The second corrective support zone is Target Zone [41.69 –
41.22].

The upside target is to break through the local high of this week +TZ3.

### [USCrude ][1]Trading tips for the upcoming week:

  1. Buy according to the pattern in the zone of  [44.17 - 43.75]. TakeProfit: 46.40, Target Zone 3 [49.32 - 48.81]. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. Buy according to the pattern in Target Zone [41.69 - 41.22]. TakeProfit: 46.40, Target Zone 3 [49.32 - 48.81]. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Gold price forecast for next week: XAUUSD analysis

The long-term gold price chart indicates the medium-term downtrend. Gold
is trading in the correction and approaching to the zone of good sell
prices [1850 - 1890]. When the price enters this zone, I suggest looking
for new sell trades with the target at the low of November + Target Zone
3 [1736.4 — 1727.1].

If we have a look at the short-term gold price chart, we shall see a buy
pattern. This is a pattern to buy in the correction. One could trade it
and buy gold. The target will be at the local high of H1.

### [XAUUSD][2] Trading tips for the upcoming week:

  1. Buy in the correction according to the pattern. TakeProfit: [1861.0 - 1850.4]. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. Sell according to the pattern in the zone of [1850 - 1890]. TakeProfit: 1766.3, Target Zone 3 [1736.4 - 1727.1]. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

The EURUSD bulls have broken out Target Zone 2 [1.2032 - 1.2012] and
consolidated the price above. The next upside target is Target Zone 3
[1.2232 – 1.2212].

It is relevant to buy the euro on the correction. The key support level
moves to the zone of [1.1990 – 1.1972]. Expect the price correction into
this zone and look for a buy pattern.

If the price breaks through the local high, we shall move the support
zone following the price.

It is not relevant to sell against the powerful medium-term buy
momentum.
