Euro will stand a trial. Forecast as of 04.12.2020Dmitri Demidenko

The [EURUSD][1] rally is impressive. However, the major growth drivers
are in the USA rather than in the euro area. The euro-area economy is
weak. Why isn't the euro falling? Let us find out the answer and make up
a trading plan.

## Weekly euro fundamental forecast

Investors believe in the [EURUSD][1] bullish outlook in the long term.
In the short term, however, the euro bulls should stand a trial. The
higher the euro is rising, the more [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s start considering the
negative factors. The euro buyers are ready to exit longs at any moment,
which could trigger a drawdown. There should be a reason to sell the
euro, and the reason could emerge.

In November, the major bearish drivers weakening the US dollar were
easing political uncertainty and increasing the global risk appetite. In
early December, the greenback fell out of favor due to the return of
talk about a reflationary environment. On the one hand, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are
convinced of the global economic recovery amid the positive [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) about
COVID-19 vaccines and look for investments outside the US. ON the other
hand, the US securities become less appealing. Joe Biden welcomed the $
908 billion compromise fiscal stimulus proposal and said any deal would
now be the first step ahead of new legislation when he takes office. The
new US president is confident that the economy will need more help.

The Treasury yield is not growing amid the concerns of the Fed’s
potential ‘operation twist,’ and the inflation expectations are surging
up to the highest levels over the past twelve or eighteen months. The US
bond market real rates are falling, making the US assets less appealing
and supporting the capital outflow from the US to other countries. In
2021, the money must be flowing to Europe. However, according to the
euro-area PMI change, the region sets back the global economy.

Even without a double-dip recession in the euro area, the euro has
enough problems. According to the forecast of 33 analysts polled by
Bloomberg, the ECB is to expand the emergency asset purchase program by
€500 billion at the meeting on December 10. The ECB is also expected to
extend the QE term from the middle to the end of 2021 and increase the
LTRO volume. The EU and the UK are failing to agree on the Brexit [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/),
and the tough position of France suggests the Brexit deal may not be
signed this year. The EU governments cannot agree on the recovery fund
of €750 billion because of Poland and Hungary. The EU even considers
plan B, which would exclude these countries from the program.

### Weekly [EURUSD][1] trading plan

Therefore, the euro has got enough weak points, and the [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s will
see the euro flaws once the rally of the US stock indexes suspends. The
first alarming signal has already appeared. Pfizer's announcement of
supply chain problems causing vaccine production to be cut from 100
million to 50 million doses in 2020 intimidated [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s and sent down
the US stock indexes on December 3. The [S&P 500][2] and the [EURUSD][1]
may also drop if the US jobs report is poor. If the euro rolls down
below the supports at $1.2125 and $1.208 may be the reason to exit long
trades.
