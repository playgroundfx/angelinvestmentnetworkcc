USDCHF: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 04.12.2020 -
11.12.2020Alex Geuta

 **Main scenario:** Consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 0.9090 with a target of 0.8800 – 0.8700.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
0.9090 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 0.9296 –
0.9468.

 **Analysis:** Presumably, the descending first wave of larger degree
(1) of 5 continues developing on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame, with wave 5 of
(1) forming inside. On the H4 time frame, there is the fifth wave of
smaller degree v of 5 developing, with wave (iii) of v forming inside.
Apparently, wave iii of (iii) is developing on the H1 time frame. If
this assumption is correct, the pair will continue to fall to 0.8800 –
0.8700. The level of 0.9090 is critical in this scenario. Its breakout
will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 0.9296 – 0.9468.
