The greenback's fast devaluation arouses outrage outside the USA

## Dozing at the bottom of a bottle, currency wars can become the main
issue of 2021

More than ten years have passed since Brazil's Finance Minister Guido
Mantega compared money printing with an economic war led by the world's
central banks, particularly the Fed. Back then, he was talking about
"currency war". Financial markets still remember those events from time
to time. In response to the pandemic-driven recession, the Fed pumped so
much liquidity into the system that the USD couldn't help falling. Other
regulators are already indignant at the dollar's slump from March's
maximums. So, a currency war may become the main topic of the year 2021.

People who don't study [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) are doomed to repeat it. People who study
[history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) are doomed to watch helplessly other people repeating it. The
Asian Central banks, including South Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand, use
verbal interventions against their currencies' consolidation, saying
they are following the rates 24 hours a day. Sweden's central bank
unexpectedly extended its QE program at the latest meeting, the krona
being one of the best performers among the G10 currencies. The Fed used
a large monetary stimulus to hurt the competitors' exports.

The USD index dropped 11% in the past eight months. Morgan Stanley says
it's overvalued by 10%, and Citi forecasts a 20% fall in 2021.The euro's
prospects seem bright, and many think the [EURUSD][1] is still at the
very beginning of its ascending movement. However, it turns out that it
takes more breath away when you are at the foot of a mountain than on
its top. After Brazil's minister delivered his famous speech in
September 2010, the greenback lost 10% in three months and 17% in nine
months. Nowadays, the Central banks are more concerned about the speed
of the USD index's fall than about its scales. Just like ten years ago.

Despite the impressive post-election results, the developing-nation
currencies' index is still 5% lower than at the beginning of the year.
The hardest-hit currencies of 2020 - the Russian rouble, the Brazilian
real, and the Turkish lira - cost 20%-30% less than in January. For
them, like for the whole humanity, the most wonderful [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) is that 2020
is finally coming to its end.

Actually, they often make a mountain out of a molehill when speaking
about currency wars. A national currency's consolidation affects
exports, but the USD's weakness makes dollar debts cheaper, which should
make developing countries happier. 2021 is the year of optimists. I've
got another piece of bad [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) for pessimists: Dutch scientists say
optimists live longer. Take care of yourself!
