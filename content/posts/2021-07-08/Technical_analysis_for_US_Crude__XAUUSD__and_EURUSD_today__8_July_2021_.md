Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 08.07.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

Yesterday, oil traders reached the target for sales within a short-term
downtrend.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

Yesterday, oil traders reached the target for sales within a short-term
downtrend. Today they will try to break out the Target Zone 71.09 -
70.56. If successful, the next target will be the Gold Zone 68.44 -
68.18.

It is profitable to consider new oil sales at strong resistances:
Additional Zone 72.07 - 71.94 and Intermediary Zone 73.53 - 73.26. To do
this, wait for a correction towards the zones and look for a pattern.
Place take profit at yesterday's low.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

  1. Sell according to the pattern in Additional Zone 72.07 - 71.94. TakeProfit: 70.56. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. Sell according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 73.53 - 73.26. TakeProfit: 70.56. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

Gold is correcting within a short-term uptrend. The target of the
correction is the retest of the Intermediary Zone 1784 - 1781. After
testing the zone, look for new purchases according to the “false
breakout” pattern. The target for purchases will be the Gold Zone 1820 -
1818.

For gold sales, traders need to break out level 1794 and consolidate the
price below. In this case, the short-term trend will reverse down, and
the target for sales will be the lower Target Zone 1770 - 1765.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

Buy according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 1792 - 1790.
TakeProfit: Gold Zone 1820 - 1818. StopLoss: according to the pattern
rules.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

Yesterday, the euro reached the main sales target – the Target Zone
1.1800 - 1.1781. The further trend development will depend on the
sellers' ability to break out this zone and consolidate the price below.
If successful, then the next target will be the Gold Zone 1.1711 -
1.1702.

It is reasonable to consider new euro sales on the correction at strong
resistances: Additional Zone 1.1830 - 1.1825 and Intermediary Zone
1.1878 - 1.1869. A pattern is required for sales. The target is the
day's low.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

  1. Sell according to the pattern in Additional Zone 1.1830 - 1.1825. TakeProfit: 1.1783. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. Sell according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 1.1878 - 1.1869. TakeProfit: 1.1783. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.
