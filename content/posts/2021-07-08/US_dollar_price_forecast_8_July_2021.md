Dollar is waking up. Forecast 08.07.2021Dmitri Demidenko

If monetary incentives have been deployed to combat the pandemic, they
need to be phased out as soon as it finishes. The currency of the
central bank that is the first to tighten monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) will
strengthen. How will it affect the [EURUSD][1]? Let us discuss the Forex
outlook and make up a trading plan.

## Weekly US dollar fundamental forecast

How fast the Forex sentiment changes. The first become the last in a
moment. Based on the minutes of the FOMC June meeting, the officials
believe that the conditions to taper the QE will be fulfilled earlier
than expected in the previous meeting. Such a tone turns the Fed into
the most aggressive central banks within the Pandexit, the process of
tapering monetary stimulus, which was employed to fight the pandemic.

In order to understand what is happening today, you need to look back at
what happened yesterday. Earlier, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell announced a
new [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) “framework” amounting to average inflation targeting,
suggesting the central bank may let inflation exceed 2% modestly and
temporarily to make up for past low inflation. Such a strategy justifies
the central bank’s monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) maintained for a long time. In June,
Fed signaled it should control the inflation growth. The ECB’s
willingness to pursue the average inflation targeting makes it look
passive compared with the Fed.

This [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) provided the basis for reflation trade, with bets on strong
economic growth and continued monetary stimulus. As a result, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s
were actively buying up cyclical stocks, the value of which is closely
related to the GDP recovery. The US stock market has lost its uniqueness
for a few reasons. Firstly, the technology sector stocks were being sold
off amid the Treasury yields rally. Secondly, the share of cyclical
securities in the EuroStoxx 600 is higher than that of the [S&P 500][2].
Money was flowing to Europe, and now it is returning to the United
States.

There is hardly any reason to buy growth stocks as the bond yields are
falling, which signals [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s’ concerns about US economic recovery.
Technology stocks are again in demand. Along with central banks from
Norway, New Zealand, and Canada, the Fed will be the first to deal with
Pandexit and let the ECB fuel the reflation trade at home - in Europe.
Everything has changed so much that the [EURUSD][3] bulls were not
supported even by the increase of the European Commission forecasts for
the euro-area GDP for 2021 from 4.3% to 4.8%, and from 4.4% to 4.5% for
2022.

### Dynamics of forecasts for euro-area GDPs

Such changes could reverse trends. I hazard a guess that the euro is
more likely to fall to $1.14 than to rise to $1.22. The Fed may announce
scaling back mortgage-bond purchases, overheating the housing market,
already in July, before the Jackson Hole summit. A booming US employment
recovery that should start in September when stimulus checks expire will
lead the US economy to full employment and force the Fed to hike the
rates in 2022.

### Weekly [EURUSD][3] trading plan

The level of 1.177, indicated earlier, could be just temporary suspend
the [EURUSD][3] fall. If the price breaks out this support, it should go
down to 1.1715. It is still relevant to sell the euro.
