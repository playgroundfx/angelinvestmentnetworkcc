IBM Stock Price Forecast: 2021, and BeyondJana Kane

Tech giant IBM beat its earnings expectations, despite a 3% drop in
turnover in 2020. But the drop in turnover for the third consecutive
quarter disappointed [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s. The cloud business is a major growth
driver (+ 7%), while the traditional activities (-4%) weigh on growth.

The group, therefore, wants to split off these more 'traditional'
activities from the fast-growing ones. The legacy business (especially
IT infrastructure services) has to go its own way in a separate, listed
vehicle. The 110-year-old company, which is included in major US
indices, the Dow Jones and S&P 500, wants to innovate and become a
hybrid cloud technology leader. Still, the company's stocks are not a
part of the famous Nasdaq 100 index as the company isn't listed on the
Nasdaq stock exchange.

The article covers the following subjects:

Customers partly use their own servers and partially rent storage and
processing power from IBM. The multi-billion acquisition of Red Hat,
where sales grew by 17%, will accelerate the transition process. What
will happen this year? What do the experts and the technical analysis
say? What is the IBM stock price prediction for the years ahead?
Discover all of this and more in this blue chips IBM stock outlook.

## IBM: a Recent Historical Overview

There are technology stocks that are totally escaping the boom in the
industry. One of them is IBM. It struggles with the slowdown in growth
in its traditional activities (technology and business services,
hardware). Despite the divestment of low-growth activities and
acquisitions in the cloud, revenues fell by more than 100 billion over
the past ten 10 years. With former CEO Rometty at the helm, [IBM][1]
prioritized dividends (USD 45.2 billion) and share buybacks (USD 75
billion) over innovation. Partly because of this, the cloud train was
missed entirely. Meanwhile, this unwieldy tanker is slowly but surely
turning:

  * IBM [led the worldwide patent list][2] in 2019. The group filed 9,262 patents. The innovation train at IBM is, therefore, back on track. The number of patents is significantly above the level of Alphabet and Apple, to name but a few. Innovative companies are ultimately rewarded.
  * Developments towards cloud, artificial intelligence, and business analysis software are driving recurring revenues up. In the second quarter, these already accounted for 60% of group turnover, an important parameter for the stability in the turnover evolution.
  * The choice of new CEO did not happen overnight. [The man is the driving force][3] behind the development of a hybrid cloud strategy and the successful acquisition of Red Hat. Obviously, we should not expect the tide to be turned entirely in 2021, but rumors are circulating that Arvind Krishna clearly wants to get rid of the "old services". Is a spin-off or sale on the horizon?
  * Hybrid cloud alone is certainly not the holy grail. Many multinationals rely on Microsoft and Amazon.com to store their data in the public cloud. However, IBM is convinced that companies will eventually return to "proprietary servers" combined with "public cloud" (hybrid model). Only then will IBM be in the front row to take advantage of this, but as mentioned, this trend has certainly not started yet. Another promising trend that of quantum computers is also still in its infancy.

## IBM Stock Current Price

The IBM stock price for today (09.07.2021) is $140.62 You can refer back
to this article to see the IBM stock price tomorrow.

Below is an interactive IBM-to-dollar real time price chart that shows
the IBM stock rate for buying and selling:

## IBM Stock Price Prediction: What do Experts Say?

[According to CNN Business][4], a total of 15 analysts offering 12-month
price forecasts for International Business Machines Corp have a median
[IBM price][1] target of 140.00, with a high estimate of 165.00 and a
low estimate of 115.00. The median estimate represents a +5.21% increase
from the last price of 133.07.

Current investment analyst recommendations are to hold stock in
International Business Machines Corp. This rating has held steady since
March, when it was unchanged from a hold rating.

## IBM Stock Technical Analysis

To make the most realistic forecast for [IBM][5] stock price, let's
analyze the biggest time frame.

We will identify global trends, which influence short-term processes,
and key levels in the monthly chart. IBM stock has followed a wide-range
bearish trend since 2013. It's marked with two solid blue lines in the
chart. There's a support zone at 100 USD (red line) where purchases take
place.

Not a single monthly candlestick managed to consolidate underneath that
level, which indicates the buyer's strength in this area. The IBM stock
price often stopped falling at 105 USD, starting from December 2018.

Since March 2020, [IBM][5] stock quotes have been in an ascending trend,
marked with a blue dotted line in the chart above. However, that's a
short-term bullish correction, most probably.

A fall in trading volumes registered over this period means the key
traders aren't interested in IBM stock's price rise. A downward reversal
will most likely occur in the coming months.

Several factors prove that:

  * June's ultimate candle looks like Doji.

  * IBM ticker failed to break through the bearish channel's upper limit. 

  * There's a repeating bearish fractal. From April 2013, such factors have always resulted in a reversal to the downside.

### IBM stock forecast for next three months

Let's do a technical analysis of the weekly chart to estimate IBM stock
prospects for the next three months.

In the weekly price chart, RSI readings confirm indirectly that the
forecast of a reversal to the downside may be realistic. We see that IMB
stock's behavior pattern has been the same since 2017. The IBM stock
price tests the bearish channel's upper limit and the RSI's upper limit
at the same time.

In all those cases, there was a sharp bearish correction and an update
of local lows. Even if there's an exception to the rule this time, the
market will hardly miss such a signal and correct as it always did.

The IBM stock's projected fall will most likely allow the price to
retest the level of 105 USD. The price target will be reached in the
next three months, based on the previous correction pace.

Nevertheless, bulls need to be cautious about buying IBM shares: the
chart shows the IBM price steadied underneath the red line for a short
time in March 2020. This fact suggests that another retest of the
support line may result in a breakout.

### Long-Term IBM Analysis for 2021

Let's analyze the price [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) and forecast how a future price will
behave in 2021.

The [[daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) IBM chart][6] shows the stock's projected values for each
month, using [Bollinger Bands](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/bollinger-bands.html).

The huge bearish potential will most likely result in a fast move to the
downside, as it was in February - April 2020. If the price breaks
through 105 USD, the next price target will be 90 US dollars, the
breakout level of March 2020.

A pullback to the descending trend line at 140 USD will most likely
follow the correction. However, it's too early to predict if the trend
line at 140 USD will be broken through.

The table below presents an expected IBM trading range for each month of
2021.

## How Has the Price of IBM Stock Changed Over Time?

We can't predict with certainty what the price of one IBM stock will be
in the next ten years, but we can look back at the price [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/). This
can help us make more reliable predictions. Below is a [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/)

## Factors that Can Affect the IBM Stock Price

Various factors may affect the [IBM stock price][1]. Below are six
critical factors that any IBM trader or [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) should analyze.

### Factor 1 – Product Line Diversification

Particular attention should be paid to the company's plans to diversify
its product lineup, as this is one of IBM's major risk factors today.

### Factor 2 – Partnerships

Also, keep a close eye on strategic alliances and partnerships that IBM
is likely to form with companies in various industries.

### Factor 3 - R&D Capabilities

IBM's R&D capabilities are also an important development point.
Innovation is the basis of the company's competitiveness in its sector.

### Factor 4 – Industry News and Company Publications

It goes without saying that you must also follow all publications on the
company's results and, in particular, the achievement of the objectives
announced in the group's various strategic plans alongside industry
[news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/). This data is some of the most closely monitored by [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s and
substantially impacts IBM's projected stock price in the short and
medium-term.

### Factor 5 – IT Industry

The IT industry's economic health in general, upon which IBM's
assignments depend heavily, is very important and should be integrated
into your fundamental analysis before trading IBM stocks.

### Factor 6 – Competition

Conduct a full study of the competition and the evolution of the market
shares of any large company operating in the IT sector.

## What is the IBM Stock Future? Are IBM Stocks a Good Investment?

First, the IBM brand is, of course, one of the strongest in the
information technology sector in the international market. This
popularity and brand awareness result from the popularity of the
products the group offers and the company's expertise in providing its
customers with the most modern hardware and software solutions.

Thanks to these capabilities, the IBM group can attract new prospects
and retain its customers by offering them existing products and new
products regularly. Below is a price prediction chart for 2021:

The IBM group also has extensive experience and expertise in managing
its manufacturing processes and materials. Indeed, the group is one of
the most innovative in the world and has been for a long time, which has
also given it time to implement effective business strategies and human
resource development programs within the company with the creation of
talent and the continuous development of the skills of its employees.
The group also plays a leading role in the development and innovation of
the IT industry. In this sense, IBM draws much of its strength from its
organizational culture.

Another strong point of IBM that is important to highlight here is, of
course, its intellectual property portfolio. The company is constantly
applying for new patents and derives its strength from owning the
largest number of patents strengthening the company and making it more
competitive.

Finally, the group has long been able to realize large economies of
scale that allow it to remain competitive and allow its industrial
customers to benefit from low-cost products and thus remain competitive
despite the high cost of new technological developments.

These elements and strengths show us how IBM has the necessary strengths
to maintain its growth in the medium and long term despite extreme
competition. Interested in [IBM stocks][1]? Make sure to create a free
