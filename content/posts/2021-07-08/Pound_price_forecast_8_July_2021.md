BoE doesn't keep promises. Forecast as of 08.07.2021Dmitri Demidenko

When the central bank officials have convinced traders that they are
going to normalize monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), and afterwards make statements that
this is harmful, the national currency, as a rule, falls. The same goes
for [GBPUSD][1]. Let us discuss the Forex outlook and make up a trading
plan

## Weekly pound fundamental forecast

Who leaked the June FOMC minutes to the press? This is how sharp-tongued
traders describe the reaction of the US dollar to the release of an
important document. Greenback was strengthening before the content of
the protocol became known, but after that it stopped, and the next day
it even weakened a bit. The impression was that someone possessed
important information before it became available to the general public.
In fact, the principle of  “Buy the rumor, sell the fact” has once again
worked. The safe-haven currencies gained the most after the USD
pullback, while the British pound feels out of place.

The reason, in my opinion, is the same – another wave of COVID-19. The
vaccination leaders are now among the outsiders. In the UK, where more
than half of the adult population has received both vaccines, the number
of COVID cases is rising sharply. Mostly among men, which some associate
with the European Football Championship. As a result, the risks that the
full opening of the economy planned by the government on July 19 will
have to be postponed are increasing. But this factor was largely taken
into account in the pairs' prices associated with the sterling, so that
the prolongation of lockdowns may negatively affect the [GBPUSD][1]
bulls.

Not only the Cabinet of Ministers, but also the Bank of England may have
to postpone their plans. Andrew Bailey and his team are in no hurry to
announce monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) normalization. However, new hires' salaries are
growing at the fastest pace since 2014, and business activity in the
construction sector has climbed to record highs, exacerbating the risks
of further inflation in the real estate market and accelerating
inflation. On the contrary, the head of the BoE took a dovish stance,
noting that premature monetary restriction would undermine the economic
recovery.

Surely Andrew Bailey takes into account the deteriorating
epidemiological situation in the UK. However, if a central bank first
hints at withdrawing monetary stimulus and then changes its position,
this negatively affects the currency it issues. The pound is no
exception. Its buyers sincerely hoped that the Bank of England would
continue to reduce the scale of QE, affecting the economy to gradually
increase the interest rate. Alas, COVID-19 made adjustments to this
process.

Once again, the UK is becoming a zone of experimentation, watched by
tens of thousands of [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s. At first, everyone was interested in how
the severance of economic ties with the EU would affect the exchange
rate of the national currency or whether accelerated vaccination could
lead to a strengthening of the pound? Finally, would the vaccination
save from the COVID delta variant?

### Weekly [GBPUSD][1] trading plan

One can only sympathize with the pound, because the fourth wave of the
pandemic is making the government and the Bank of England be cautious
and slows down the economic recovery. This, against the backdrop of
rapid growth in US GDP and the Fed's readiness to taper QE, creates
preconditions for [GBPUSD][1] sales towards 1.365 and 1.35.
