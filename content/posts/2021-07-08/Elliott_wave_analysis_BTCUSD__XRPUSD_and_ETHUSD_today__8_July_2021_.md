Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 08.07.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

The cryptocurrency pairs covered in the article continue moving up in
the leading diagonals. The prices should be rising.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

The BTCUSD must have completed the descending wave [A] as a five-wave
impulse. Next, the market has started moving up. There must be
developing the first leg of the bullish simple zigzag, sub-wave (A) as a
leading diagonal 1-2-3-4-5. The final wave 5 might be developing as an
ending diagonal because its fourth leg finished further than the sub-
wave [1]. The price should be moving up in sub-wave [5] to a level of
38100.00.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 33407.00, TP 38100.00

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

The XRPUSD pair must have finished the descending sub-wave (W), and the
market, having turned up, is rising. There must be developing the first
leg of the new bullish zigzag, sub-wave A. Wave is likely to be
unfolding as a leading diagonal, with the first four legs
[1]-[2]-[3]-[4]. If the presumption is correct, and sub-wave [4] has
completed as a double three (W)-(X)-(Y), the market will be rising in
wave [5] to a level of 0.760 in the next few days.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] **** today:

Buy 0.636, TP 0.760

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

The ETHUSD, like the BTCUSD, has finished declining in the bearish five-
wave impulse A. The market has turned up and started developing the new
upward wave. There must be forming sub-wave [A] as a leading diagonal.
There have finished the first four sub-waves (1)-(2)-(3)-(4), and the
final sub-wave (5) is still developing. Wave (5) should finish the
ending diagonal 5 at a level of 2555.00.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Buy 2284.27, TP 2555.00
