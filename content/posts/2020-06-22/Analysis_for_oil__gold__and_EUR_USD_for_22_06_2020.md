Analysis for oil, gold, and EUR/USD for 22.06.2020Alex Rodiоnov

###  **USCrude – oil**

Oil price continues rising. The middle-term is up.

At the end of last week, oil buyers broke through the local high, and
the price approached the strong resistance Target Zone 5 [41.67 -
40.92]. If the zone is broken out, the next target will be Target Zone
6. Otherwise, the price will be corrected down.

Oil short-term is also up. The upside target is Target Zone 5 [41.67 –
40.92]. As the local high was broken through last Friday, the support
zones should be rearranged.

Now, Additional Zone is in the price range of [38.12 - 37.90], and
Intermediary Zone is at [35.87 – 35.42]. The latter is the trend key
support. I recommend buying oil on the correction down to these
supports.

  1. Buy according to the pattern in Additional Zone [38.12 - 37.90]. TakeProfit: 40.31, Target Zone 5 [41.67 - 40.92]. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

###  **XAUUSD – gold**

Gold price is rising and approaching the major buy target, level 1764.4.
This is the level of the previous local high.

Buyers are now testing Target Zone 5 [1757.2 – 1751.2]. If they break
out the zone and consolidate above, the next upside target in the
uptrend will be Target Zone 6 [1817.2 — 1811.2].

In the local uptrend, the price has broken out the local high, but it
hasn’t yet reached the target in Target Zone [1771.3 – 1762.2].

I recommend enter new gold purchases on the correction towards the
strong supports, Additional Zone [1738.1 - 1736.1] and Intermediary Zone
[1717.6 – 1713.5]. Expect the test of the supports and look for a buy
pattern. The first take profit should be placed at the update of the
local high, the second take profit is in Target Zone.

Hold up trades entered at level 1705.6. TakeProfit: 1764.4. StopLoss:
1687.2.

###  **EURUSD – euro/dollar**

The EURUSD middle-term trend turned down at the end of last week. The
price broke out Target Zone [1.1240 – 1.1222] and consolidated below.

For this and next week, the sell target will be Target Zone 2 [1.1058 —
1.1040].

![LiteForex: Analysis for oil, gold, and EUR/USD for 22.06.2020][7]

The EUR/USD short-term downtrend continues. As Target Zone [1.1240 –
1.1222] is broken through, the sell target is Gold Zone [1.1149 –
1.1140].

The price is now being corrected a little up after the previous fall. If
the price tests Additional Zone [1.1218 - 1.1213] or Intermediary Zone
[1.1268 – 1.1259] in the correction, we shall enter new sell trades
according to the pattern.
