## Forecast for BTCUSD, LTCUSD, ETHUSD, EOSUSD, XRPUSD pairs

###  **Elliott wave analysis for[BTCUSD][1]**

In the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) BTCUSD chart, there is developing the corrective wave 4 as
a bearish double zigzag [W]-[X]-[Y]. After the [W] zigzag completed, the
market has started rising in the linking wave [X] that is also a double
zigzag. The (W) zigzag and the linking down wave (X) look complete, and
there is now forming the bullish zigzag (Y). Let us see the chart
structure on the eight-hour timeframe.

It is clear that there is now developing the upward impulse wave A
within the bullish zigzag of a large degree. The A wave is composed of
five sub-waves [1]-[2]-[3]-[4]-[5]. After the corrective wave [4]
completed as a skewed triangle, the market has started forming the
initial phase of the final impulse wave [5]. The A wave is likely to
complete at a level of around 11000. Next, the price should turn down
and start following a new downtrend.

###  **Elliott wave analysis for[ETHUSD][4]**

Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, EOS and Ripple][5]

The ETHUSD [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) chart displays the formation of the triple zigzag
[W]-[X]-[Y]-[X]-[Z], where the linking up wave [X] is currently
unfolding. The [X] wave is likely to be developing as a double zigzag
(W)-(X)-(Y). The first two sub-waves (W) and (X) of this double zigzag
have completed, and there is now forming the final wave (Y) as a plain
zigzag A-B-C. Let us study the chart structure in a shorter timeframe.

In the new bullish zigzag currently unfolding, there is developing its
first element, the impulse wave A. It is composed of five sub-waves. The
first four sub-waves have completed, the impulse [5] is yet developing.
This trading week, the price should continue moving up in the sub-waves
3-4-5 towards a level of 270.00, as it is outlined in the chart.

###  **Elliott wave analysis for[LTCUSD][7]**

 **![LiteForex: Weekly cryptocurrency forecast. Elliott wave analysis
for Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, EOS and Ripple][8]**

The LTCUSD market is following the global down triple zigzag
[W]-[X]-[Y]-[X]-[Z], where the sub-waves [W], [Y], and [Z] are simple
bear zigzags. Wave [Z] isn’t yet completed, it is composed of the sub-
waves (A)-(B)-(C). There is now forming the upward correction (B) that
may complete at a level of around 83.00, which is the previous high made
by wave 4. Let us see the structure of the (B) correction in more detail
in the shorter timeframe.

Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, EOS and Ripple][9]

It is clear from the H8 LTCUSD timeframe that, within the upward
corrective wave (B), there have completed the bullish impulse wave A,
and the sideways correction B that is likely to be a double three. There
could be now developing the initial phase of the impulse wave C. As
there have completed only two sub-waves within the C impulse, the price
should be rising over the next few weeks.

###  **Elliott wave analysis for[EOSUSD][10]**

 **![LiteForex: Weekly cryptocurrency forecast. Elliott wave analysis
for Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, EOS and Ripple][11]**

It is clear from the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) chart that the EOSUSD market, like other
major cryptocurrencies, is forming the bearish triple zigzag
[W]-[X]-[Y]-[X]-[Z]. There is now developing the linking wave [X] that
is composed of the sub-waves (A)-(B)-(C). The (A) impulse has completed,
the corrective wave (B) is still forming. Let us see the chart structure
in more detail.

![LiteForex: Weekly cryptocurrency forecast. Elliott wave analysis for
Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, EOS and Ripple][12]

The corrective wave (B) can be developing as a horizontal contracting
triangle A-B-C-D-E, with the D wave developing as simple zigzag
[a]-[b]-[c] within the (B) wave. The sub-waves D and E should complete
soon. Next, the market should start rising in the bullish impulse wave
(C), as it is outlined in the chart.

###  **Wave analysis for[XRPUSD][13]**

 **![LiteForex: Weekly cryptocurrency forecast. Elliott wave analysis
for Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, EOS and Ripple][14]**

The XRPUSD market is also forming the global down triple zigzag. The
chart displays the middle part of this formation. It is clear that the
second upward linking wave [X] has started after wave [Y] completed as a
double zigzag. Let us see the structure of the [X] wave currently
unfolding in more detail.

![LiteForex: Weekly cryptocurrency forecast. Elliott wave analysis for
Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, EOS and Ripple][15]

The upward linking wave [X] may complete as a simple zigzag (A)-(B)-(C).
The impulse wave (A) has completed. The corrective wave (B), which is
composed of the sub-waves W-X-Y, also looks complete. The market is now
following the final element of the impulse wave (C) that is composed of
the sub-waves 1-2-3-4-5. Presumably, the price will continue rising to a
level of 0.290. An approximate trajectory of the Ripple future price
movement is outlined in the chart.
