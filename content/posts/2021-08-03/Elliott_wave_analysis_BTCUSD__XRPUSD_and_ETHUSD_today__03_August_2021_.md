Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 03.08.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

All three cryptocurrencies covered in the article should be falling in
prices in the bearish impulses.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

The BTCUSD market must have completed forming the large corrective wave
[B] as a double zigzag (W)-(X)-(Y). Next, the market turned down and
started declining. There must be forming the inceptive element of the
bearish wave, which could be unfolding as an impulse. The sub-waves (1)
and (2) must have finished. The Bitcoin price should continue declining
in wave (3) to a level below 36370.00, marked by the B correction.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Sell 38626.00, TP 36370.00

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

The XRPUSD must have completed the large linking wave (X) as a flat
A-B-C. Therefore, there is developing the initial part of the new
bearish wave, presumably, an impulse. The first two small sub-waves [1]
and [2] could have completed, and there should be unfolding the impulse
wave [3]. The price could go down far below level 0.695, marked by
correction 4.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] **** today:

Sell 0.721, TP 0.695

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

The ETHUSD market, like the BTCUSD, finished forming the large
corrective wave B. Wave B is a simple zigzag [A]-[B]-[C]. Therefore,
there should be unfolding the initial part of the new bearish wave. The
price should soon reach level 2302.00, where the triangle correction (4)
completed. Next, the market should continue declining to lower levels.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Sell 2526.08, TP 2302.00
