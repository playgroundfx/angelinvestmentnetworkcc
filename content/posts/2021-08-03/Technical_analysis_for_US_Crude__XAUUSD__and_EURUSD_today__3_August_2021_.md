Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 03.08.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

The oil price broke out the Additional Zone 72.51 – 72.38 and started a
deep correction down in the short-term uptrend.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

The oil price broke out the Additional Zone 72.51 – 72.38 and started a
deep correction down in the short-term uptrend yesterday. As a part of
the correction, the price tested the Intermediary Zone 71.15 - 70.88,
which is the trend border. Buyers are holding up the zone, so it is
relevant to look for buy entries with a target at 73.80.

An alternative scenario suggests the price should break out the
Intermediary Zone and close below at the US session. If so, the trend
will turn down, and the sell target will be the lower Target Zone 68.43
— 67.88.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

Buy according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 71.15 - 70.88.
TakeProfit: 73.80. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

Yesterday, the gold price tested the key support 1810 - 1807 of the
short-term uptrend. The buyers reacted, and the price went up. The
growth was stopped in the Additional Zone 1818 – 1817. The gold price is
now going down and testing the Intermediary Zone.

Sell trades entered on the correction in the Additional Zone should be
exited at the breakthrough of yesterday’s low. If the price consolidates
below yesterday’s low, the gold short-term trend will reverse down.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

Monitor the market.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

The EURUSD traders were testing the Additional Zone 1.1864 – 1.1860
yesterday. The price performed a short-term growth but hasn’t broken out
the high of last Friday. The euro price is again approaching the
Additional Zone today.

Today, the price could break out the Additional Zone and enter the range
of 1.1850 – 1.1811. One should look for a buy pattern in the zone and
buy the euro with a target in the Target Zone 1.1948 — 1.1930.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

Buy according to the pattern in the zone of 1.1850 - 1.1811. TakeProfit:
Target Zone 1.1948 - 1.1930. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.
