Economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the week 24.05.2021 – 30.05.2021Jana Kane

##  **Review of the main events of the Forex economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the
next trading week (24.05.2021 – 30.05.2021)**

 **Trading on key Forex [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/): next week we expect the publication of
important macro statistics from the US, as well as the results of the
meeting of the central bank of New Zealand.**

The dollar ended last week with another decline. As follows from the
minutes published last Wednesday, following the April meeting, the Fed
announced that it will continue to buy assets at the current pace until
the economy shows “further significant progress” towards the Fed's goals
- maximum employment and inflation, at 2% on average. At the same time,
the Central Bank does not intend to raise interest rates until these
goals are fully achieved or even exceeded.

“Based on the April labor market report, we have not made further
significant progress,” said Fed Deputy Chairman Richard Clarida last
Monday. Clarida also noted that central bank officials “need to watch
and be attentive to the incoming data,” although he thinks that the
recent rise in inflation is likely to be temporary for the most part.

After rethinking the results of the April Fed meeting and carefully
studying the minutes published last Wednesday, market participants
returned to selling the dollar.

So far, the trend of its further weakening continues.

The next week will not be full of important macro statistics.
Nevertheless, financial market participants will pay attention to the
publication of important macro statistics from the US and the results of
the meeting of the central bank of New Zealand.

 **Traders should pay attention to the publication of the following
macro indicators:**

 ***during the coming week, new events may be added to the [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) and
/ or some scheduled events may be canceled**

 ****GMT time**

###  **Monday, May 24**

No important macro statistics are scheduled to be published. Banks in
several European countries are closed, and Catholics around the world
celebrate Whit Monday. The trading volumes on this day will be low.

Market participants trading in the yen will want to pay attention to the
speech (at 11:05 GMT) by the head of the Bank of Japan Haruhiko Kuroda.
In his speech, Kuroda will probably give some comments on the bank's
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), although traders hardly should expect anything new from
him in this regard. “We need to patiently continue to ease monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/),” Kuroda has traditionally said. If he does not touch on monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) issues, the reaction to his speech will be weak.

###  **Tuesday, May 25**

No important macro statistics are scheduled to be published.

###  **Wednesday, May 26**

###  **02:00 NZD Interest rate decision by the Reserve Bank of New
Zealand. Accompanying statement. Monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) comment**

After the bank's management decided to cut the rate by 0.75% at an
unscheduled meeting in March 2020, the current interest rate of the
Reserve Bank of New Zealand is at 0.25%. The bank's management explained
its decision by a loss of momentum in the New Zealand economy and a
sharp slowdown in the global economy amid the coronavirus pandemic.

“Global economic activity continues to weaken, which wears down demand
for goods and services from New Zealand. Increased uncertainty and
contraction in international trade are contributing to lower economic
growth in trading partner countries,” a recent statement from the RBNZ
said.

The RBNZ believes that wages growth remains weak. At the same time,
inflationary expectations are declining, and low levels of business
confidence indicate a slowdown in hiring and wages growth.

Restrained economic growth (New Zealand's GDP growth has slowed since
the second half of 2018) and a weakening labor market, as well as
escalating international trade wars and a deteriorating global economic
outlook, are forcing the Reserve Bank of New Zealand to keep interest
rates low. An additional and unforeseen risk to the global and New
Zealand economies is the coronavirus epidemic.

It is expected that at this meeting, the RBNZ will not cut or increase
the rate yet, but may speak in favor of lowering it in the coming months
if the economic situation in the country and in the world worsens.

In the accompanying statement and comments, the RBNZ management will
provide an explanation of the decision on the interest rate and comments
on the economic conditions that facilitated the adoption of this
decision.

At this time, the volatility in the quotations of the New Zealand dollar
may rise sharply.

Earlier, the RBNZ stated that against the background of "many factors of
uncertainty" monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) "will remain soft for the foreseeable
future," but "may be adjusted accordingly." According to the bank's
management, for a stable recovery of the New Zealand economy and
inflation growth, "a lower rate of the New Zealand dollar is necessary."

Probably, the head of the RBNZ Adrian Orr will reaffirm the bank's
propensity to pursue a soft monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), which will lead to
continued pressure on the New Zealand currency.

###  **03:00** **NZD Press conference of the RBNZ**

During the press conference, the head of the RBNZ Adrian Orr will make
an explanation of the bank's decision. His speeches often serve as an
unofficial source of information on the future direction of the RBNZ's
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). In his opinion, the country's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) should
correlate with the dynamics of employment and financial stability of the
state.

Earlier, the RBNZ stated that against the background of "many factors of
uncertainty" monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) "will remain soft for the foreseeable
future," but "may be adjusted accordingly." For a stable recovery of the
New Zealand economy and rising inflation, "a weaker NZ dollar is
needed."

It is likely that the head of the RBNZ Adrian Orr will reaffirm the
bank's propensity to pursue a soft monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), which will lead to
continued pressure on the New Zealand currency.

In any case, volatility in the New Zealand dollar trade is expected to
rise during the RBNZ press conference.

###  **12:30 USD Durable goods orders. Capital goods orders (ex defense
and aviation)**

This indicator reflects the value of orders received by manufacturers of
durable goods and capital goods (capital goods are durable commodities
used to produce durable goods and services) involving large investments.
The goods produced in the defense and aviation sectors of the US economy
are not included in this indicator. A strong result strengthens the USD.
Previous values ​​of the indicator "durable goods orders": +1% in March,
-1.2% in February, +3.4% in January 2021, +1.2% in December, +1.3% in
November, +1.8% in October, -18.3% in April, -16.7% in March, +2.0% in
February, -0.2% in January 2020.

Previous values ​​of the indicator "capital goods orders ex defense and
aviation": +1% in March, -0.9% in February, +0.6% in January 2021, +1.5%
in December, +1.2% in November, +1.9% in September, +2.1% in August,
-6.6% in April, -1.3% in March, -0.6% in February, +0.9% in January 2020
year.

In theory, the relative growth of the indicator has a positive effect on
the dollar; the market reaction to its negative value may be negative
for the dollar in the short term. Data worse than the previous value
will also negatively affect the dollar quotes.

Forecast for April: +0.8% (durable goods orders), +1.5% (capital goods
orders ex defense and aviation).

It seems that the growth of indicators continues after their recovery in
previous months from a strong drop in March and April 2020, which should
have a positive effect on the dollar quotes. Better-than-expected data
will also have a positive impact on the dollar.

###  **12:30 USD US Annual GDP for Q1 (second estimate)**

GDP data is one of the key indicators (along with data on the labor
market and inflation) for the Fed in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of its monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).
Strong result strengthens the US dollar; weak GDP report negatively
affects the US dollar. In the previous 4th quarter, GDP grew by +4.3%
after rising +33.4% in Q3 2020, and after falling -31.4% in Q2 and -5.0%
in Q1 2020.

If the data indicate a decline in GDP in the 1st quarter, the dollar
will be under pressure. The positive data on GDP will support the dollar
and the American stock indices, although they are already mostly priced
in. The preliminary forecast for the 1st quarter of 2021 was +6.4%.

###  **Friday, May 28**

No important macro statistics are scheduled to be published.

However, traders should still pay attention to the publication in the
period from 12:30 to 14:00 (GMT) of the block of macro statistics for
the United States, which includes data on personal income/expenses of
Americans, as well as the PMI index in Chicago for April and updated
Consumer Confidence Index by the University of Michigan for May. This
indicator reflects the confidence of American consumers in the economic
development of the country. The indicator is expected to come out in May
with a revised value of 82.9, which is better than the preliminary value
of 82.8.

It is likely that at the end of the last full trading week of the month,
many market participants will want to take profit or loss. The driver of
these decisions can be the publication of the above economic indicators.
