Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 22.04.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

Yesterday, gold updated April 19 high. The priority buy pattern in the
Intermediary Zone yielded profits.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

Yesterday, oil broke out the Intermediary Zone 61.80 - 61.54. The next
target within the short-term downtrend is the Target Zone 59.25 - 58.74.

Sell oil on correction at strong resistances. According to the
methodology, the most favorable sell prices are in the zone of 62.24 -
61.91. It is possible to use level 60.75 as a target to take a part of
the profit.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

Sell from the zone of 62.22 - 61.91. TakeProfit: 60.75, Target Zone
59.25 - 58.74. StopLoss: 63.05.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

Yesterday, gold updated April 19 high. The priority buy pattern in the
Intermediary Zone yielded profits. Yesterday, the price also
consolidated above the Target Zone 1782 - 1777. The next growth target
is the Gold Zone 1805 - 1802.

It is profitable to consider new gold purchases according to the
patterns at strong supports: Additional Zone 1785 - 1784 and
Intermediary Zone 1772 - 1770.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

  1. Buy according to the pattern in Additional Zone 1785 - 1784. TakeProfit: Gold Zone 1805 - 1802. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. Buy according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 1772 - 1770. TakeProfit: Gold Zone 1805 - 1802. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

EURUSD traders tested the Additional Zone 1.2036 - 1.2031. At some
point, they even managed to break it out and approach the Intermediary
Zone 1.1992 - 1.1983. However, the US trading session closed the price
inside the support at level 1.2034.

Thus, today, the short-term euro uptrend continues. Level 1.2072 serves
as the growth target. It is possible to consider long trades at the
current prices with a stop beyond the Additional Zone.

It will be possible to sell the euro if the price breaks out the
Additional Zone again. In this case, open a short trade and close it in
the Intermediary Zone.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

  1. Buy in Additional Zone 1.2036 - 1.2031. TakeProfit: 1.2072. StopLoss: 1.2020.

  2. Open sell positions below level 1.2020. TakeProfit: Intermediary Zone 1.1992 - 1.1983. StopLoss: 1.2038.
