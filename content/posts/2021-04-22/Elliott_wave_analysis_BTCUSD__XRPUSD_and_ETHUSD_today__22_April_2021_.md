Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 22.04.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

Bitcoin is forming a skewed triangle. Therefore, after the triangle
completes, the price will resume declining.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

The BTCUSD market is forming a descending double zigzag W-X-Y. Wave X
seems to be unfolding as a triangle. There have finished the sub-waves
[A]-[B]-[C]-[D], so the price should start rising soon in the final sub-
wave [E] to a level of 57300.00. At this level, the X wave will reach
the 50% Fibonacci level of the triple zigzag W. One could enter buy
trades in the current situation.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 53911.00, TP 57300.00

* * *

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

The XRPUSD market is developing the corrective down wave [2] as a
regular zigzag (A)-(B)-(C). Wave (A) is a leading diagonal, wave (B) is
likely to be a double zigzag W-X-Y. There is developing wave Y, with the
sub-waves [A] and [B] competed inside. The Ripple price should be rising
in the [C] impulse to a level 1.550, where wave (B) will retrace wave
(A) by 50%. One could enter long trades in the current situation.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] today:

Buy 1.302, TP 1.550

## Elliott wave Ethereum analysis

The ETHUSD continues forming the upward linking wave (X) as a double
zigzag W-X-Y. The final leg of this zigzag, sub-wave Y, is unfolding as
a triple zigzag [W]-[X]-[Y]-[X]-[Z]. The final sub-wave [Z] should
conclude the entire pattern at a level of 2550.00, where wave (X) will
be 100% of wave (W). One could enter purchases in the current situation.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Buy 2372.09, TP 2550.00
