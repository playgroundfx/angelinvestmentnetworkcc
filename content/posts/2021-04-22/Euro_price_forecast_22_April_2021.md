Euro throws out a feeler. Forecast as of 22.04.2021Dmitri Demidenko

The ECB hawks express discontent with the ultra-easy monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/),
and [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are worried that Christine Lagarde's departure from the
dovish rhetoric will cause panic among the [EURUSD][1] bears. Let us
discuss the Forex outlook and make up a trading plan.

## Weekly euro fundamental forecast

Central banks do not act in isolation, they follow general trends. The
trend is usually determined by the Fed. However, if the Fed is willing
to remain passive and allow the US economy to overheat, why shouldn’t
another central bank go ahead? The Bank of Canada's optimism about the
prospects for domestic GDP, its hints about an overnight rate hike in
late 2022, and the move to tapering the QE support not only the loonie
but also other G10 currencies competing with the US dollar. There could
be a different leader among central banks.

In theory, the Fed should be the first to hike interest rates. According
to 100 Reuters experts, the US economy will expand by 6.2% in 2021,
which will be its best growth since 1984. The consensus forecast is
lower than that of the IMF (6.4%) or the Fed (6.5%), but 15% of
respondents reported growth of 7% or more. In such circumstances, the
central bank must consider monetary tightening to prevent an
uncontrolled inflation acceleration. But consumer prices have been in a
depressed state for so long that the Fed does not believe that they will
stay above 3% for a long time. Yes, the PCE will jump sharply in the
coming months, but it should quickly decline.

The Fed prefers to wait and see, but other regulators may have different
views on the overheating of their economies. The first one to take
active steps has been the Bank of Canada, which is tapering the QE
earlier than the Fed; the BoC is also willing to hike the interest rates
before the US central bank. Other central banks could follow the BoC,
including the ECB, with more and more central bankers discontent with
the ultra-easy monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).

Forex analysts suggest the Governing Council hawks have agreed to boost
the weekly pace of assets purchases under the PEPP in the second quarter
with one condition, they call for the QE reduction in the third quarter.
The president of the Dutch central bank, Klaas Knot, openly speaks about
this. If the euro-area economic growth and inflation improve during the
rest of the year, the ECB may begin a gradual elimination of monetary
stimulus starting from the third quarter. According to Jens Weidmann,
the President of the Deutsche Bundesbank, the PEPP should not become a
permanent fixture. The Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme is
associated with the crisis and should end when the crisis is over.

The ECB hawks throw out a feeler and watch the market reaction.
Furthermore, the EU vaccination rate increases (Brussels has set
ambitious plans to vaccinate 70% of the adult population by the end of
the summer). The European Recovery Fund should soon start operating, and
consumers have accumulated billions of euros in extra savings.
Therefore, the [EURUSD][1] rally looks quite natural.

### Weekly [EURUSD][1] trading plan

Of course, Christine Lagarde will be cautious, keeping the dovish stance
until at least June, when the forecasts are to be updated. However, if
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s notice the ECB split, the [EURUSD][1] bulls should go ahead.
The strategy of buying the euro on the corrections down yields the
profit, so it remains relevant. If the price breaks through April’s
high, it will continue the rally up to 1.2155 and 1.218.
