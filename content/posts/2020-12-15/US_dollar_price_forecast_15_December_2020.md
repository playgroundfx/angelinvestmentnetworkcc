Dollar is gathering black swans. Forecast as of 15.12.2020Dmitri
Demidenko

Next year, the USD index could drop by 15%, or the euro could go down to
$1.06. Which of these forecasts will come true? Let us discuss the Forex
outlook and make up a [EURUSD][1] trading plan.

## Weekly US dollar fundamental forecast

While the [EURUSD][1] is jumping up and down, responding to the [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/)
about Brexit and the stimulus negotiation between Republicans and
Democrats, large banks and international corporations scare the
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s with shocking Forex forecasts. Standard Chartered presented a
list of eight black swans that could shake financial markets in 2021.
The company accurately predicted that the Fed would lower the federal
funds rate in 2020, the gold price would reach $2000 per ounce, and was
close to the [S&P 500][2] rally this year, suggesting a 20% rise.
Therefore, it could make sense to consider its Forex projections.

Out of eight events, unlikely but still possible, I would like to
consider three ones directly related to the [EURUSD][1] pair. According
to Standard Chartered, the euro could go down to $1.06 by mid-2021 amid
the disappointment of the EU fiscal stimulus and the ECB's failure to
provide the euro-area economic recovery because of the QE's low
efficiency. Otherwise, if Democrats and Republicans do not agree on the
additional fiscal stimulus package, the US administration could abandon
the strong dollar [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). In this case, the US Treasury could drop the
USD index by 15% through currency interventions. The third black swan
for the euro-dollar could become the resignation of Joe Biden. In this
case, the [S&P 500][2] should crash, thereby strengthening the
greenback.

The shocking projections convince only of one thing, the [EURUSD][1] can
go both up and down, and those who don’t hedge against the risks could
quickly go bankrupt. Projections are a matter of probability. Now,
financial markets are focused on the global economic recovery amid the
expectations of a soon victory over the pandemic. Yes, the US economy
can also be expanding quite well, but the reflation environment will
support risky assets' demand. The major difficulties are the people’s
reluctance to take vaccines and problems of transportation and
vaccination. With this regard, the information about the growing share
of American adults willing to get vaccinated is good [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) for the
[EURUSD][1]. However, some states claim about insufficient funding,
which is a negative factor.

The euro/dollar still depends on the Brexit results and stock indexes.
Besides, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s do not think the FOMC December meeting can trigger a
strong [EURUSD][1] move. Only 19% of the 47 experts polled by Bloomberg
expect that the Fed will increase the QE size before the end of 2021.
32% of respondents, on the contrary, believe that the Fed should
decrease.

### Projections for changes in QE size

One out of three economists expects an extension of the emergency asset
purchase program. However, only 23% of them suggest the Fed report this
in December. The Fed is likely to explain the future QE pace by the
unemployment and inflation rate, but it may not occur at the December
meeting.

###  ** **Weekly[EURUSD][1] trading plan****

I don’t think the issues of Brexit and US fiscal stimulus will be
settled before Christmas. Therefore, the pound volatility is likely to
increase, while the [EURUSD][1] and [S&P 500][2] should stabilize. The
euro could enter the consolidation range of $1.204-$1.224.
