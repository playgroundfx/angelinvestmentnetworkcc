Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 15.12.2020Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I suggest entry signals
to trade each cryptocurrency.

All the three cryptocurrency pairs covered in the article have recently
finished corrective waves and started rising in new bullish impulses.
Let us see the situation in more detail.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

 ****

The BTCUSD market started forming the bullish impulse C more than two
months ago. There have completed the sub-waves [1]-[2]-[3]-[4], and the
price is rising in the final wave [5]. Wave [5] is a five-wave impulse.
The deep corrective wave (4) composed of the sub-waves a-b-c has
recently finished, and the price is now rising in wave (5). The market
should be running up to a level of 20900.00, where the impulse waves (5)
and (3) will be equal.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 19434.500 TP 20900.000

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

 ****

The Ripple market is forming the large upward zigzag A-B-C. The A
impulse and the B correction have completed. The C wave is still forming
as an impulse. The bearish correction [4] has recently ended; its final
sub-wave (c) is an ending diagonal. The market is following the initial
element of the bullish impulse [5]. The price should be rising above
level 0.625.

### Trading plan for **[XRPUSD][2]** today:

Buy 0.493, TP 0.625

* * *

## Elliott wave Ethereum analysis

 ****

The ETHUSD market is also forming the impulse wave C of a larger degree.
The four legs out of five have finished within the C wave at the time of
writing. The most recent chart section displays the structure of the
final wave [5], which is an impulse (1)-(2)-(3)-(4)-(5). The corrective
wave (4) must have finished as a bearish triple zigzag. Next, there
completed the first two legs of the fifth wave. Therefore, the market
should continue rising in wave (5) above level 634.00.

### Trading plan for  **[ETHUSD][3] **today:

Buy 590.31, TP 634.000
