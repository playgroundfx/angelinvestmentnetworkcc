XAUUSD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 02.04.2021 –
09.04.2021Alex Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 1755.42 with a target of 1650.00 – 1620.09.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
1755.42 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 1799.64
– 1875.25.

 **Analysis:** Daily time frame: presumably, the ascending third wave of
larger degree (3) formed, and a descending correction continues
developing as wave (4). Wave С of (4) appears to be forming on the H4
time frame, with wave iii of C formed and corrective wave iv of C
completed inside. Apparently, wave v of C started developing on the H1
time frame, with corrective wave (ii) of v coming to its end inside. If
the presumption is correct, the pair will continue to drop to the levels
of 1650.00 – 1620.09. The level of 1755.42 is critical in this scenario,
as the breakout will enable the pair to continue rising to the levels of
1799.64 – 1875.25.
