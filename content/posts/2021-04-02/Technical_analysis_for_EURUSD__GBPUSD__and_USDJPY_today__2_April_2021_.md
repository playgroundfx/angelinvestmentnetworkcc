Short-term analysis for EURUSD, GBPUSD and USDJPY for 02.04.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for EURUSD,
GBPUSD, and USDJPY using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

The USDJPY price is correcting to a short-term uptrend. Yesterday the
Additional Zone 110.65 - 110.63 was broken out.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Euro price forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

Yesterday, the EURUSD price broke out the Additional Zone 1.1748 -
1.1744 and is now trading in a deep correction. Today the price will
reach the Intermediary Zone - the border of the trend (1.1792 - 1.1784).
While this resistance is being held, it is profitable to look for euro
sales with two targets: the level of 1.1751 and the price area of
​​1.1715 - 1.1706.

If the Intermediary Zone is broken out with price consolidation at the
US trading session, for example, on Monday, the short-term trend will
reverse up. In this case, from the next trading day, consider buying the
euro with a target in the Margin Zone 1.1880 - 1.1864.

### [EURUSD][1] trading ideas for today:

Sell according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 1.1792 - 1.1784.
TakeProfit: 1.1751, 1.1715. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Pound price forecast for today: GBPUSD analysis

Yesterday, the British pound updated its Monday high. The pair's price
growth was caused by a general fall in the US dollar price. However, the
short-term GBPUSD trend remains down.

At the moment, the price is approaching the trend border in the
Intermediary Zone 1.3881 - 1.3862. While this zone is being held, it is
profitable to look for the pound sales with the target at level 1.3678.

Buy the pound if the level of 1.3881 is broken out. The target for
purchases will be the Margin Zone 1.4092 - 1.4054.

### [GBPUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

Sell according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 1.3881 - 1.3862.
TakeProfit: 1.3762, 1.3678. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.
