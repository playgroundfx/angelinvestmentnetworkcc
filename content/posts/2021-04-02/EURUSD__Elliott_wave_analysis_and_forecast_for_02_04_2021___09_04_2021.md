EURUSD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 02.04.2021 –
09.04.2021Alex Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 1.1845 with a target of 1.1600 – 1.1489.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
1.1845 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 1.1989 –
1.2172.

 **Analysis:** Daily time frame: presumably, the first wave of larger
degree 1 of (3) has formed, and a downside correction is forming as wave
2 of (3). Apparently, wave a of 2 is developing on the H4 time frame
with wave (c) of a forming inside. Supposedly, the fifth wave of smaller
degree v of (c) is developing on the H1 time frame. If the presumption
is correct, the pair will resume falling to the levels of 1.1600 –
1.1489. The level of 1.1845 is critical in this scenario. Its breakout
will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 1.1989 – 1.2172.
