Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 02.04.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

Bitcoin and Ripple should decline slightly in corrective waves. Next,
the prices will resume growth.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

The BTCUSD market continues forming the upward impulse 5. The market has
finished developing the first three legs of the impulse, and the price
is now being corrected in wave [4]. Correction [4] could complete as a
regular zigzag (A)-(B)-(C). Wave (B) may have finished as a zigzag. The
price could go down in impulse (C). Next, having finished the corrective
wave, the market will start rising in the final wave [5]. The BTCUSD
should be rising to a level of 65000.00. One could enter buy trades.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 59502.88, TP 65000.00

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

The most recent chart section displays the structure of the upward wave
(Z), unfolding as a zigzag A-B-C. Wave (Z) will conclude the triple
zigzag of a larger degree. After wave A completed as a bullish impulse,
there has started the corrective wave B. Wave B must be unfolding as a
double zigzag [W]-[X]-[Y]. In the near future, the [Y] wave should
finish the bearish corrective wave B. Next, the market should start
rising in the final bullish impulse C of (Z) towards a level of 0.645,
as outlined in the chart. One could enter purchases in the current
situation.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] today:

Buy 0.567, TP 0.645

## Elliott wave Ethereum analysis

The ETHUSD pair continues developing the final zigzag-shaped wave 5 of
the ending diagonal (5). Wave 5 is composed of the sub-waves
[a]-[b]-[c]. The market is now forming the bullish impulse wave [c],
namely, the beginning of the upward impulse wave (3). The market should
continue growing in the near future, as outlined in the chart. The
entire wave [c] could complete at a level of 2100.00. Therefore, it is
relevant to open buy positions in the current situation.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Buy 1996.96, TP 2100.00
