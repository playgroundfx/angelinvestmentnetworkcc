USDJPY: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 02.04.2021 –
09.04.2021Alex Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions from corrections above the
level of 108.37 with a target of 112.50 – 114.00.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
108.37 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of 106.90
– 104.52.

 **Analysis:** Daily TM: apparently, a descending correction of larger
degree finished forming as wave B, and wave С started developing, with
the first wave (1) of С forming inside.

On the H4 time frame, the third wave of smaller degree 3 of (1) is
developing, with wave iii of 3 forming inside. On the H1 time frame,
apparently, wave (i) of iii formed, correction (ii) of iii is completed,
and wave (iii) of iii is developing. If the presumption is correct, the
pair will continue to rise to the levels of 112.50 – 114.00. The level
of 108.37 is critical in this scenario as the breakout will enable the
pair to continue declining to the levels of 106.90 – 104.52.
