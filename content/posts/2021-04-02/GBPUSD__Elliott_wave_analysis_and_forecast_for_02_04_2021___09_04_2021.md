GBPUSD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 02.04.2021 –
09.04.2021Alex Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 1.4000 with a target of 1.3572 – 1.3158.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
1.4000 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 1.4237 –
1.4400.

 **Analysis:** Daily time frame: presumably, the first wave of larger
degree (1) finished developing, with wave 5 of (1) formed inside. A
downward correction started developing as wave (2) on the H4 time frame,
with wave A of (2) forming inside. Apparently, the third wave of smaller
degree iii of A is forming on the H1 time frame, with corrective wave
(iv) of iii completed and wave (v) of iii developing inside. If the
presumption is correct, the pair will continue to drop to the levels of
1.3572 – 1.3158. The level of 1.4000 is critical in this scenario as the
breakout will enable the pair to continue rising to the levels of 1.4237
– 1.4400.
