Forex believes in vaccine. Forecast for NZDUSD, AUDUSD, and USDNOK as of
14.01.2021Dmitri Demidenko

The correction of January's USD index indicates that [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s doubt the
victory over the pandemic. Confidence can only be restored by successful
vaccination. Let us discuss the Forex outlook and make up [NZDUSD][1],
[AUDUSD][2] and [USDNOK][3] trading plans

## Fundamental New Zealand Dollar, Australian Dollar, Norwegian Crown
forecast for six months

When [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are not worried about anything, the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) takes
the lead in Forex. But as soon as there are fears of a global scale, the
new market drivers appear. From 2018 to 2019, market was focused on
trade wars, in 2020 on the pandemic. I don't think COVID-19 will be
quietly eradicated. On the contrary,  it will continue to terrorize
financial markets in 2021. But you need to look at the coronavirus from
a different angle. Last year, investment plans were influenced by the
speed of its spread and the amount of damage caused to the economies of
individual countries and regions. This year the efficiency of the
vaccination process will be decisive in the world economy.

You can talk as much as you want about the reasons for the USD
strengthening in early 2021. However, the reduction of speculative short
positions on the greenback only occurs if [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s begin to doubt their
own plans' feasibility. Most of them hoped that defeating the pandemic
would trigger explosive growth in global GDP and international trade and
also support both risky assets and the currencies of export-oriented
countries and regions, including the euro. Such a scenario is only
possible if vaccines are introduced quickly and successfully. Alas,
there are still numerous problems. By the end of 2020, the United States
vaccinated only 2.8 million people, but the original plan included 20
million people. By mid-January, they have 25.4 million doses at their
disposal, but only 8.9 million Americans received the vaccine. However,
the vaccination campaign's speed in the United States is one of the
highest in the world.

There is certainly some good [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/). Joe Biden has promised to produce the
vast majority of COVID-19 vaccines and speed up its delivery, while the
European Union will double purchases of BioNTech/Pfizer. I am an
optimist and sincerely believe that everything will end well. The only
question is when?

Earlier, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s assumed that the first quarter of the year would be
challenging. But already we are expecting rapid GDP growth in the second
or third quarter. In November-December, they made bets on the emerging
markets' currencies and bought [EURUSD][4]. However, the slow
vaccination process makes them reconsider their plans in January. What
if the second quarter turns out to be tough? Is it too early to buy
euros and EM assets? Perhaps their time will come in March-April, and
now it would be worthwhile to return to the US dollar?

In my opinion, only a complete failure of the vaccination process can
break the USD index downtrend. I do not want this to happen. Otherwise,
the correction will end sooner or later, and the trend will begin to
recover. As a result, a question about the purchases will arise. The
sensitivity of the various currencies to vaccine introduction will
provide guidance.

The good [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) about vaccinations acts as a catalyst for the growth of
the New Zealand and Australian dollars, the Norwegian crown, and
emerging market currencies. In this regard, [NZDUSD][1] and [AUDUSD][2]
corrections should be used for purchases with targets at 0.75 and 0.82,
respectively. A pullback in [USDNOK][3] should be used to enter sell
trades with a target at level 8.
