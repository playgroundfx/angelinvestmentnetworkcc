Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 14.01.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

Ethereum is forming the initial element of a bearish trend. Ripple is
forming the corrective wave (2) of the upward impulse. Bitcoin is about
to finish the bearish impulse.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

The BTCUSD market is forming the impulse wave 5, with four legs out five
of a smaller degree completed inside. There is forming wave [5] as an
impulse; wave [5] has also completed four legs out five within the
pattern. The price is rising in the sub-wave (5), with a corrective wave
completed inside as a standard zigzag. Over the next few days, there
should be developing the sub-waves [3]-[4]-[5] of a smaller degree,
which make up wave 5, up to a level above the previous high marked by
impulse 3. Therefore, impulse 5 should end at a level above 42050.00.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 37201.00 TP 42050.00

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

As it is clear from the most recent chart section, the market has
started developing the initial element of the bullish impulse. The
upward wave (1) has complete, and the price is now declining in the
corrective wave (2). Wave (2) should also complete as a standard zigzag
a-b-c. Correction b seems to have finished as a double zigzag. The
market should be declining in the c impulse towards a level of 0.200.

### Trading plan for **[XRPUSD][2]** today:

Sell 0.281, TP 0.200

## Elliott wave Ethereum analysis

The ETHUSD market is forming a new bearish trend. There is likely to be
forming the first impulse wave of the downward zigzag [A]-[B]-[C]. The
bearish correction (4) might have finished as a zigzag a-b-c within the
[A] impulse. Over the next few days, the price could be declining in
wave (5) to a level of 784.00. After the [A] wave ends, the market
should turn up and start forming the bullish correction [B], as outlined
in the chart.

### Trading plan for  **[ETHUSD][3] **today:

Sell 1100.78, TP 784.00
