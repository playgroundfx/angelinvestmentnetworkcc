The dollar holds its breath. Forecast as of 22.06.21Dmitri Demidenko

The growing number of Fed’s hawks shook the markets. However, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s
are calming down and trying to clarify the position of the US central
bank. Let us discuss the Forex outlook and make up a [EURUSD][1] trading
plan.

## Weekly US dollar fundamental forecast

The Fed’s members were unanimous during the recession, which helped to
save the economy. However, the US growth is recovering, and [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s
should be prepared for a split among the US central bankers. FOMC
members have different opinions on the prospects for achieving inflation
and unemployment goals. There are many hawks in the Committee, and the
Fed will try to discourage them. If so, the [EURUSD][2] bulls will be
able to go ahead.

The first to attack the FOMC hawks was New York Fed President John
Williams, who announced that the federal funds rate would be raised when
the US reaches full employment and inflation slightly exceeded the 2%
target on a sustainable basis. Despite the economic recovery, its
progress is not yet enough to start tapering the QE. Everything is
extremely clear and understandable. Conversely, the comments of St.
Louis Fed President James Bullard are vague and ambiguous. He says that
the rate might be raised at the end of 2022. Dallas Fed President Robert
Kaplan is worried about the housing market and that the easy money
policies would increase surpluses and imbalances.

The US economy is progressing. According to the Fed’s forecasts, the GDP
could reach 7% in 2021, so the growing number of hawks in the FOMC is
natural. The market was simply not prepared for the number of hawks to
increase so quickly. If they continue to multiply, tightening monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) is inevitable. Another matter is whether they will be allowed to
start monetary normalization. Talks about potential monetary tightening
pushed up two-year and five-year yields, flattening the US Treasury
yield curve. Remember, the yield curve inversion in 2019 was a clear
signal of recession while the Fed’s officials ignored the signals
referring to the US economy’s strength. Next, the pandemic started.

Following John Williams’ speech, the US stock indexes recovered after a
sell-off the day before resulted from Bullard’s announcement about a
rate hike in 2022. The [EURUSD][2] went up above the bottom of figure
19. Investors are looking forward to Jerome Powell’s testimony before
Congress. In testimony prepared for delivery to Congress, Powell said
that employment will be rising in the next few months while the
inflation pressure should weaken.

### Weekly [EURUSD][2] trading plan

Forex is gradually stabilizing after the shock resulted from the change
in the FOMC rate forecast. I do not think the Fed will allow the hawks
to go ahead; the US central bank is likely to proceed towards monetary
normalization very slowly. Therefore, it will be relevant to buy the
[EURUSD][2] when the price breaks out the resistance at 1.1925.

The euro could be supported by the release of Germany’s and euro-area
PMIs. However, traders could bet on the USD longs ahead of the
publication of the Personal Expenditure Index. This week, I expect
increased volatility, so enter trades with narrow targets.
