Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 22.06.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

The euro is trading in a short-term downtrend, the border of which is at
level 1.1921.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

Yesterday, a short-term oil uptrend continued, as a result, the Target
Zone 2 72.64 - 72.11 was broken out. The next growth target is Gold Zone
2 75.03 - 74.76.

It is profitable to look for new oil purchases at strong support zones.
Additional Zone 71.81 - 71.68 and Intermediary Zone 70.49 - 70.22 are
among the strong supports at the moment.

Today it is reasonable to wait for a correction in the levels indicated
above and look for a new buy pattern with the target at 73.05.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

Open buy positions according to the pattern in 71.81 - 70.97.
TakeProfit: 73.05. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

Gold buyers are testing the border of the short-term downtrend 1794 -
1783. Until the price breaks out the zone, it is profitable to look for
sales according to the pattern. As soon as level 1794 is broken out,
enter gold purchases.

The sales target will be the June 18 low. After the trend reversal, the
target for purchases will be the upper Target Zone 1810 - 1805.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

Sell according to the pattern in the zone of 1794 - 1783. TakeProfit:
1762. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

The euro is trading in a short-term downtrend, the border of which is at
level 1.1921. The trend's target is to reach the Gold Zone 2 1.1826 -
1.1817.

Now the price is trading in the supply zone 1.1921 - 1.1891. Today it is
profitable to look for a sell pattern. It would be reasonable to take a
part of profits at yesterday's low if the price moves in the direction
we need.

Euro purchases require a trend reversal by breaking out level 1.1921 and
price consolidation higher.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

Sell according to the pattern in the zone of 1.1921 - 1.1891.
TakeProfit: Gold Zone 2 1.1826 - 1.1817. StopLoss: according to the
pattern rules.
