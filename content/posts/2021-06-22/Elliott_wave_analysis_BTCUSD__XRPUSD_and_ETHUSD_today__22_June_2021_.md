Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 22.06.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

All three cryptocurrency pairs covered in the article should continue
declining, so it is still relevant to sell.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

The hourly BTCUSD chart displays the descending wave (A) unfolding as a
simple five-wave impulse. The corrective wave 4 composed of sub-waves
[W]-[X]-[Y] must have completed. The market has started declining in the
bearish wave 5. There should be developing sub-waves [4]-[5] to a level
of 26060.00, impulse [3] looks complete. One could enter sell trades in
the current situation.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Sell 33167.65, TP 26060.00

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

The XRPUSD market is declining in the impulse wave C composed of sub-
waves [1]-[2]-[3]-[4]-[5]. There is unfolding the final wave [5]. So
far, the sub-waves (1)-(2)-(3)-(4) have completed, and the final sub-
wave (5) is still developing. The Ripple price is likely to continue
falling to a level of 0.560, as is outlined in the chart. Next, there
should start a new bull trend. One could enter sell trades in the
current situation.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] today:

Sell 0.645, TP 0.560

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

The ETHUSD market continues forming the descending wave (A) as a simple
five-wave impulse composed of sub-waves [1]-[2]-[3]-[4]-[5]. The first
four waves must have completed within the (A) wave, and there is
unfolding the descending wave [5]. The down impulse wave (3) seems
complete. The price should rise a little in correction (4), and then,
the market will go down in wave (5), as is outlined in the chart. The
entire impulse wave A should end at a level of 1700.00. This is the
previous low made by wave [3]. One could enter sell trades in the
current situation.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Sell 1985.02, TP 1700.00
