Loonie is ahead of US dollar. Forecast as of 22.06.2021Dmitri Demidenko

BoC's earlier start of the monetary restriction [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) compared to the
Fed, the bullish oil trend, and capital inflows to the Canadian stock
market raise doubts about the breakout of the [USDCAD][1] downtrend. Let
us discuss the Forex outlook and make up a trading plan

## Weekly Canadian dollar fundamental forecast

What happened in Forex after the June FOMC meeting is a fair market
reaction to the change in the Fed's outlook. However, not all dollar
pairs should have responded so violently to the hawkish stance of the
Fed rate forecasts. The rise of [USDCAD][1] against the background of
the strong oil and the outstripping pace of the Canadian monetary
restriction over the US one looks excessive, and the loonie rate is
undervalued.

The shift in expectations for a federal funds rate hike to 2023 is an
important milestone in Forex. However, the Bank of Canada intends to
tighten monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) ahead of the Fed, namely in 2022. Moreover, this
time the overnight rate may rise to 2% or higher, exceeding its previous
high for the first time in four cycles of monetary restriction.
Previously, borrowing costs fell short of the extremes seen in old
cycles. In 2020, the overnight rate was 1.75%.

The hot real estate market and soaring inflation are good reasons not
only for QE tapering but also for raising borrowing costs. The BoC is
already tapering QE, in contrast to the Fed, which so far is only
talking about the withdrawal of monetary stimulus. According to
Bloomberg estimates, Canada is ranked second in the list of real estate
bubbles after New Zealand. Unlike RBNZ, which is already ready to
tighten monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), Tiff Macklem and his colleagues are passive,
fearing to provoke the loonie strengthening. Sooner or later they will
have to act.

Inflation adds fuel to the fire: consumer prices in Canada accelerated
to 3.6%, base CPI to 2.3%, which is the highest level since 2011 and
2009, respectively. The central bank continues to repeat the mantra
about the temporary nature of the inflation acceleration. The Fed did
the same as well. As soon as the US regulator changed its stance, the
greenback immediately soared. Loonie is next?

### Dynamics of Canadian inflation

The sharp rise in interest in the US dollar after the FOMC meeting led
to the formation of divergence between oil and [USDCAD][1]. As [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/)
shows, such discrepancies end anyway, while a serious correction in the
oil market looks extremely dubious. According to Trafigura, in the next
12-18 months [Brent][2] may exceed $100 per barrel due to increased
consumption and structural underinvestment in production. Ultimately,
the market will face a situation where demand will not only recover, but
also exceed pre-pandemic levels, and supply will not have the capacity
it needs.

The outstripping nature of the BoC's monetary restriction in comparison
with the Fed and strong oil are not the only loonie's advantages. In
2020, the Canadian securities market lagged behind the US one due to the
low share of technology companies in the TSX Composite structure.
Nowadays, this circumstance contributes to the inflow of capital.

### Weekly [USDCAD][1] trading plan

In my opinion, it is now profitable to buy loonie against USD. The
inability of the [USDCAD][1] bulls to return above 1.24 is a sign of
their weakness and a reason to sell the pair.
