Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 25.09.2020Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I suggest entry signals
to trade each cryptocurrency.

Bitcoin and Ripple have finished down impulse waves. Both
cryptocurrencies are forming the bullish corrective waves. One could
enter purchases under the current conditions.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

 ****

After the bullish impulse wave A completed, there has started the
corrective wave B. The B wave mus be unfolding as a double zigzag
[W]-[X]-[Y]. There have finished waves [W] and [X], and the bullish
correction (B), which is the final leg of the [Y] wave, is currently
forming. It may complete at a level of around 10935. Next, there should
be developing the bear impulse wave (C) that will conclude the large
corrective wave B.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

The upward linking wave (X) has lately completed as a triple zigzag
W-X-Y-XX-Z. Next, there has started forming a down zigzag. The bearish
wave A has completed as a five-wave impulse. The market is now forming
an upward corrective wave B that may reach level 0.249. After this level
