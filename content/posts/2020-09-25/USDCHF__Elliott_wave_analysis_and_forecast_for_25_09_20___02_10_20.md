USDCHF: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 25.09.20 - 02.10.20Alex
Geuta

 **Main scenario:** Consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 0.9304 with a target of 0.8900 – 0.8800.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
0.9304 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 0.9398 –
0.9497.

 **Analysis:** Presumably, a descending third wave of larger degree (3)
continues developing on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame, with wave 1 of (3) forming
inside. Wave v of 1 is developing on the H4 time frame. Wave (iii) of v
formed and a local correction is nearing completion in the form of wave
(iv) of v inside wave v of 1. Apparently, wave c of (iv) is nearing
completion on the H1 time frame. If the presumption is correct, the pair
may be expected to fall to the levels of  0.8900 – 0.8800. The level of
0.9304 is critical in this scenario. Its breakout will allow the pair to
continue rising to the levels of 0.9398 – 0.9497.
