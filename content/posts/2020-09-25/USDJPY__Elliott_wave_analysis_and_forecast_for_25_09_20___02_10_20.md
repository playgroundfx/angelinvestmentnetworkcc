USDJPY: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 25.09.20 – 02.10.20Alex
Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions from corrections above the
level of 103.95 with a target of 106.63 – 108.14.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
103.95 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of 103.00
– 102.00.

 **Analysis:** On the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame, apparently a descending
correction of larger degree finished forming as wave B, and wave С
started developing, with the first wave 1 of (1) of C formed inside. On
the H4 time frame, a descending correction of smaller degree presumably
finished forming as wave 2 of (1), with wave c of 2 developed inside.
Apparently, the third wave 3 of (1) started developing on the H1 time
frame, with the first counter-trend wave (i) of i of 3 forming inside.
If the presumption is correct, the pair will continue to rise to the
levels of 106.63 – 108.14. The level of 103.95 is critical in this
scenario, as the breakout will enable the pair to continue declining to
the levels of 103.00 – 102.00.
