Did you ask for cheap euro? Review as of 25.09.2020Dmitri Demidenko

While the optimist and the pessimist are arguing about how full or empty
the glass is, the realist is finishing his bottle. Who benefits from
[EURUSD][1]’s correction?

## EURUSD buyers are banned from long positions. Why?

It turned out at the end of September that the euro fans aren’t devoted
enough to stay on the battlefield when they smelt trouble.  The US stock
indexes’ correction and the pandemic’s second wave in Europe made them
forget that the US’ and the eurozone’s economies are recovering at a
different pace. Ultimately, speed isn’t as important as direction!

[EURUSD][1]’s correction came true as a result of the ECB members’
verbal interventions. Christine Lagarde and her peers from the Executive
Board would constantly mention the importance of the euro rate to
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). They said, the euro rate must be considered when making
inflation forecasts, so it was vital to follow what was happening in the
Forex market.  It is strange that Donald Trump, who asked for
depreciating the dollar a few days later, didn’t mention Europe and
blamed China for yuan manipulations. Even more so strange as [USDCNH][2]
had collapsed. However, some people never listen to others. They just
wait for their turn to speak.

As they explained to Trump, it’s impossible to make the dollar dance to
his tune; the greenback should be free-floating. It seems that
Washington is a venue for pessimists. The SNB, for example, not only
buys foreign currency to depreciate the frank; it also plans to publish
quarterly reports on interventions instead of annual ones. The ECB is
optimistic about its talent to talk [EURUSD][1] bulls into not going
north, saying that the euro is closely watched over.

While the optimist and the pessimist are arguing about how full or empty
the glass is, the realist is finishing his bottle. The euro corrected as
long positions were phased out. Someone really needs  market uncertainty
to make the main currency pair drop: the Congress can’t decide on fiscal
stimulus, no one knows who will win the presidential election in the
USA, and the dollar doesn’t have alternatives as a safe haven currency.
It’s all fine, but let’s try looking into the future. Does anyone really
believe that the second wave of Covid will be stronger than the first
one, or that the global economy will fall into a double recession, or
that the [S&P 500][3] may collapse below March’s trough? An appetite for
risk is a changeable thing. You may have it today, but you may lose it
tomorrow.

No doubt, no one can make a 100% guarantee in Forex. No one can promise
that the euro will cost $1.25 in 2021. It’s like believing that you can
measure your weight using a scale.

A girl stepped onto a scale and destroyed it. So she never understood if
she was fit. Anything can happen in a market.
