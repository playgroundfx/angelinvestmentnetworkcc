Medium-term forecast for oil, gold, and EURUSD 25.09.2020Alex Rodionov

I welcome my colleagues! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest trading
signals for traders who trade in medium-term trends.

Gold has reached all sell targets this week. The medium-trend gold trend
is down. The downside target for next week is Target Zone 2 [1829.4 —
1820.1].

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for next week: USCrude analysis

The oil medium-term uptrend continues. The volatility has been low this
week. The traders must be accumulating trading positions. The upside
targets for the trend are the high of August and Target Zone 6 [49.17 –
48.42]. I recommend entering purchases at the Fibonacci levels of 50 and
61.8 according to the technical and Price Action patterns.

Alternative scenario. The price breaks out the trend key support [37.34
- 36.72]. If so, the medium-term trend will turn down, and we shall sell
oil with a target in Target Zone 2 [31.14 — 30.52].

### [USCrude ][1]Trading tips for the upcoming week:

  1. Hold up purchases entered according to the pattern in Target Zone [37.34 - 36.72]. TakeProfit: 43.50. StopLoss: at breakeven. 
  2. Buy according to the pattern at the Fibonacci levels of 50 and 61.8. TakeProfit: 43.50. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Gold price forecast for next week: XAUUSD analysis

In the previous weekly forex analytics, I wrote “I recommend holding
down the sell trades entered according to the Price Action pattern or
entering new ones at the current levels with a stop loss above the high
of this week. The sell targets will be at levels 1903.0 and 1862.3.”

This week, gold has achieved all sell targets. According to the margin
zones, the medium-term trend has turned down, Two US sessions closed
below the support zone of [1922.4 – 1913.1].

So, there is another downside target for next week, it is Target Zone 2
[1829.4 - 1820.1].

I recommend entering new sell trades on the correction in the resistance
zones of 1922.4 - 1902.9] and [1951.0 - 1941.7]. The trend border is at
1951.0.

### [XAUUSD][2] Trading tips for the upcoming week:

  1. Sell according to the pattern in the zone of [1922.4 - 1902.9]. TakeProfit: Target Zone 2 [1829.4 - 1820.1]. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. Sell according to the pattern in Target Zone [1951.0 - 1941.7]. TakeProfit: Target Zone 2 [1829.4 - 1820.1]. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Euro/dollar price forecast for next week: EURUSD analysis

This week, the medium-term trend has turned down. The price broke out
Target Zone [1.1811 – 1.1791] and consolidated below. The price also
broke out the key level of 1.1752.

The downside target for the next week is Target Zone 2 [1.1611 –
1.1591].

The price is currently being corrected up. One could enter sell trades
when the price tests level 1.1752 and the trend key support and there
emerges a sell setup.

### [EURUSD][3] Trading tips for the upcoming week:

  1. Sell according to the pattern at level 1.1752. TakeProfit: Target Zone 2 [1.1611 - 1.1591]. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.
