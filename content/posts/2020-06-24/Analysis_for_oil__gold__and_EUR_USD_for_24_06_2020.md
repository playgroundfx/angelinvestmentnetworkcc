Analysis for oil, gold, and EUR/USD for 24.06.2020Alex Rodiоnov

###  **USCrude –** **oil** ****

Oil reached Target Zone 5 [41.67 – 40.92] in the middle-term uptrend. If
buyers break this zone out, the next will be Target Zone 6. Otherwise,
the price will be corrected down.

The trend key support is in the zone [32.04 — 31.14].

The oil short-term trend is also up. The price is now being corrected,
it is rolling down from TZ5. The first target of the corrective move is
to test Additional Zone [39.49 – 39.30].

After AZ is tested, I suggest looking for a pattern to buy oil with the
target to break through the local high.

If AZ is broken out downside, the correction will continue down to the
target in Intermediary Zone [37.54 - 37.15]. After IZ is tested, we
shall enter buy trades in the trend.

###  **XAUUSD – gold**

Gold has reached all targets for buy trades entered in the key support
zone of the medium-term uptrend, the high of May has been broken
through. Now, we shall see if buyers will consolidate the price above
Target Zone 5 [1757.2 – 1751.2]. If they do, the next upside target will
be TZ 6 [1817.2 — 1811.2].

Let us switch to the short-term chart to analyze the local trend.

Based on margin zones, the XAUUSD is trading in the short-term uptrend.
The price is now trading in the strong resistance zone [1771.3 – 1762.2]
trying to break it out. If bulls succeed, the next growth target will be
Gold Zone [1812.5 – 1808.0].

Otherwise, there should start a correction. If there is a correction
down, I suggest looking for purchases according to the patterns in the
strong support zones.

###  **EURUSD – euro/dollar**

The EUR/USD was corrected up to the key resistance of the middle-term
downtrend [1.1368 – 1.1350]. Expect a sell pattern and enter short
trades with the target at the low of last week.

![LiteForex: Analysis for oil, gold, and EUR/USD for 24.06.2020][7]

The EUR/USD short-term trend turned up yesterday, as the price broke out
the trend key resistance [1.1268 – 1.1259] and reached Target Zone
[1.1368 - 1.1350].

The price is now being corrected down in the new uptrend. I recommend
entering short-term purchases according to the pattern either in
Additional Zone [1.1303 – 1.1298] or in Intermediary Zone [1.1257 -
1.1248]. The buy target will be to break through yesterday’s high.

breakout.
