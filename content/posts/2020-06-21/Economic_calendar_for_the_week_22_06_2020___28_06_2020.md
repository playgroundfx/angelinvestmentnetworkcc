Economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the week 22.06.2020 – 28.06.2020Jana Kane

##  **Overview of the main events of the Forex economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the
next trading week 15.06.2020 to 21.06.2020**

 **Trading on key Forex [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/): we are expecting the publication of
important macro statistics from Germany, the Eurozone, the US, Great
Britain, Japan, the minutes of the ECB June meeting, as well as the
results of the meetings of the central banks of China and New Zealand.**

Neither the Bank of England, nor the National Bank of Switzerland, nor
the Bank of Japan began making changes to their monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) last
week. The Bank of England decided to increase the quantitative easing
program by £100 billion, which was good [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) for [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s but signaled
a high uncertainty about the prospects for the British economy suffering
one blow after another before December 31, the completion date of the
Brexit transition. According to media reports, the United Kingdom will
not extend this period, and the EU ambassador to the United Kingdom Joao
Vale de Almeida said last Thursday that the EU will introduce full
customs control and inspection for goods from the UK in 2021.

The US dollar rose last week, while global and US stock indices also
ended the past week in a positive territory.

The Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, who spoke last week in Congress,
reiterated that the Central Bank will support the economy until its
recovery, advising Congress not to scale back support measures too
quickly. Soft rhetoric of Powell’s statements, as well as billions of
dollars sent by the Fed to the financial system, are a positive factor
for the stock market. However, Powell also stated (after the Fed’s
meeting) that “the pandemic is causing great damage and creates great
uncertainty about the future,” the scale of the recession is “veiled by
extreme uncertainty,” and it will depend on whether the virus can be
contained. Powell believes that "the labor market may have bottomed out,
but we (the Fed) do not know for sure," repeating that the pandemic
"creates great uncertainty about the future."

So, judging by the mood prevailing among the leaders of the largest
world central banks, the situation in the world economy is far from
stable, and high volatility and multidirectional movements will continue
to be observed in world financial markets, providing traders with
earning opportunities.

Next week, two more major world central banks (RB of New Zealand and
People’s Bank of China) will hold their meetings and make decisions on
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). They are also unlikely to change their monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).

Investors will also pay attention to the publication of important macro
statistics from Germany, the Eurozone, the US, Great Britain, Japan, and
the minutes of the ECB meeting in June.

 _ **Traders should pay attention to the following significant
macroeconomic data expected next week:**_

 *** during the coming week new events may be added to the [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) and
scheduled events may be canceled**

###  **Sunday, June 21**

###  **23:00 AUD Speech by head of the RBA Philip Lowe**

In his speech, Philip Lowe will give an assessment of the current
situation in the Australian economy and indicate further plans for the
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the agency. Any signals regarding changes in RBA
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) plans will cause a sharp increase in volatility in the
AUD trading and in the Australian stock market. If he does not touch on
the topic of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), then the reaction of the market to his
speech will be weak.

Market participants would also like to hear Lowe's opinion on the
policies of the central bank in the context of the ongoing pandemic of
the coronavirus and, as economists believe, the beginning of a recession
in Australia's economy, the first in 30 years.

“There is significant uncertainty about the short-term prospects of the
Australian economy,” said Philip Lowe after one of the RBA meetings.

The key interest rate of the RBA remains at a record low of 0.25%, while
the target rate of return on 3-year government bonds is also at 0.25%.
The decision to lower the rate and determine the current target level of
government bond yields was made at an unscheduled meeting of the RBA on
March 19 in order to support Australian businesses and citizens amid the
rapid spread of the coronavirus pandemic.

###  **Monday, June 22**

###  **01:30 CNY Bank of China's interest rate decision**

Since May 2012, the People's Bank of China has been steadily lowering
the interest rate to support Chinese producers. The last time the bank
lowered its interest rate was in April (by 0.20% to 3.85% at the
moment).

In recent months, in the context of international trade conflicts and a
slowdown in the global economy, the world's largest central banks are
moving towards easing their monetary policies in order to support
national economies and increase the competitiveness of goods exported
from these countries.

The People's Bank of China is also in line with this process. The
depreciation of the yuan has become particularly relevant in the last 2
years, when the confrontation between the two most powerful economies in
the world began. One of the measures to mitigate the negative
consequences of increased duties on the import of Chinese goods into the
United States was the depreciation of the national currency of China.
This measure was supposed to maintain the previous volumes of imports of
Chinese products to the United States, which would cost American buyers
less due to the difference in the exchange rates of national currencies
of the United States and China.

Now, another strong negative factor has been added to this - the
coronavirus pandemic.

It is likely that at this meeting, the People’s Bank of China will keep
the interest rate at the same level of 3.85%, although a rate cut is
also possible.

However, if the People's Bank of China makes unexpected statements or
decisions, then volatility may increase in the entire financial market.
Investors will also be interested in the bank’s assessment of the
consequences of coronavirus for the Chinese economy and its [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) in
the near future in this regard.

###  **15:00 CAD Speech by Head of the Bank of Canada  Tiff Macklem**

Tiff Macklem replaced Stephen Poloz as head of the Bank of Canada on
June 3, 2020. Macklem, in fact, has the same objectives as his
predecessor on this position.

Annual inflation in Canada reached a negative level in April. The last
time the annual drop in consumer prices occurred was in September 2009.
The Canadian economy, as well as the entire global economy, is showing
signs of slowdown in the first half of this year, due to a downturn in
business activity due to the coronavirus pandemic. Earlier this year,
Stephen Poloz said that the Canadian economy is stable enough to keep
rates unchanged, despite the worsening situation in the global economy.
However, the situation is rapidly changing, and not for the better. It
will now be interesting to listen to McMlem's opinion on the stability
of the Canadian economy and the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the central bank. If
Tiff Macklem touches on the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the Bank of Canada, the
volatility in the Canadian dollar quotes will increase sharply. The
harsh tone of his speech will help strengthen the Canadian dollar. The
soft rhetoric and the intention to pursue a soft monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) will
negatively affect the CAD quotes.

Probably, it can also provide some guidance for [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s before the
next meeting of the Bank of Canada, which will be held in the middle of
next month (July 15).

###  **Tuesday, June 23**

###  **07:30 EUR PMI in the manufacturing sector of the German economy
according to Markit Economics (preliminary release). Composite PMI of
the German economy according to Markit Economics (preliminary release)**

PMI in the manufacturing sector of the German economy is an important
indicator of business conditions and the general state of the German
economy. This sector of the economy forms a significant part of German
GDP. A result above 50 is seen as positive and strengthens the EUR,
below 50 - as negative for the euro. Forecast for June (preliminary
release): 39.2.

Previous values: 36.6 in May, 34.5 in April, 45.4 in March, 48 in
February, 45.3 in January, which indicates a slowdown in business
activity in this sector of the German economy. The growth of the
indicator above the previous value may support the euro (in the short
term), although its value is still below 50. Data worse than the
forecast will have a negative impact on the euro.

Composite PMI of the German economy is an important indicator of the
business environment and general state of the German economy. A result
above 50 is seen as positive and strengthens the EUR, below 50 - as
negative for the euro. Forecast for June (preliminary release): 34.1
against 32.3 in May, 17.4 in April, 35 in March, 50.7 in February, 51.2
in January. The publication of this indicator with the indicated
expected value is unlikely to strongly support the euro. The data worse
than the forecast and below the value of 50.0, as a rule, have a
negative impact on the euro.

###  **08:00 EUR Composite PMI in the manufacturing sector of the
Eurozone economy according to Markit Economics (preliminary release)**

Eurozone's PMI is an important indicator of the state of the entire
European economy. A result above 50 is seen as positive and strengthens
the EUR, below 50 - as negative for the euro. Forecast for June
(preliminary release): 25.0 (against 31.9 in May, 13.6 in April, 29.7 in
March, 51.6 in February, 51.3 in January), which is probably unlikely to
have any positive impact on the euro. If the data turn out to be worse
than the forecast, then the euro may fall sharply in the short term.

###  **08:30 GBP UK's PMI in the services sector according to Markit
Economics (preliminary release)**

PMI in the UK's services sector is an important indicator of the state
of the British economy, although the service sector does not have such a
strong impact on the country's GDP as PMI in the manufacturing sector.

If the data turn out to be worse than the forecast and the previous
value, the pound will most likely fall sharply in the short term. Data
better than forecast and the previous value will have a positive impact
on the pound. At the same time, a result above 50 is considered positive
and strengthens the GBP, below 50 - as negative for the GBP.

Previous indicator values: 29.0 in May, 13.4 in April, 34.5 in March,
53.2 in February, 53.9 in January.

###  **02:00 NZD The decision of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand on the
interest rate. RBNZ's accompanying statement**

After the bank management made a decision to lower the rate by 0.75%
during an unscheduled meeting on March 15, the current interest rate of
the Republic of New Zealand is at 0.25%. The management of the bank
explained its decision by the loss of momentum in the New Zealand
economy and the sharp slowdown in the global economy amid the
coronavirus pandemic.

"World economic activity continues to weaken, which reduces the demand
for goods and services from New Zealand. Increased uncertainty and a
decline in international trade contribute to a decrease in economic
growth in the trading partner countries," the RBNZ said in a recent
statement.

The RBNZ believes that wage growth remains weak. At the same time,
inflationary expectations are reduced, and low levels of business
confidence indicate a slowdown in hiring and wages growth.

Restrained economic growth (New Zealand's GDP growth has slowed since
the second half of 2018) and a weakening labor market, as well as an
escalation of international trade wars and a worsening global economic
outlook, are pushing the Reserve Bank of New Zealand to keep interest
rates low. An additional and unforeseen risk for the world and New
Zealand economies was the epidemic of coronavirus in the world.

It is expected that at this meeting the RBNZ will not begin to lower or
raise the rate, but may argue in favor of lowering it in the coming
months in the event of a worsening economic situation in the country and
in the world.

In the accompanying statement, the RBNZ management will explain the
decision on the interest rate and comment on the economic conditions
that contributed to the adoption of this decision.

At this time, the volatility in trading on the New Zealand dollar could
rise sharply.

Earlier, the RBNZ stated that against the backdrop of a "set of
uncertainties," the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) "will remain soft in the foreseeable
future," but "may be adjusted accordingly." According to the bank’s
management, for a stable recovery of the New Zealand economy and rising
inflation “a lower New Zealand dollar rate is needed”.

Probably, the head of the RBNZ Adrian Orr will reaffirm the bank’s
intention to pursue a soft monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), which will preserve the
pressure on the New Zealand currency.

###  **11:30** **EUR** **Account of the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) meeting of the
ECB**

This document provides an overview of the current [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the ECB with
planned changes in the financial and monetary spheres. The publication
of this document may cause a surge in volatility in trading of the euro
and on the European stock market.

Investors will carefully study the text of the minutes of the recent ECB
meeting to catch additional signals regarding the QE program and the
prospects for monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). Recently, weak macro data from the
Eurozone has been indicating a slowdown in the European economy, which,
against the backdrop of international trade conflicts and the
coronavirus pandemic, is putting pressure on the ECB towards further
easing of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).

At a meeting on June 4, the ECB refrained from making changes to the
current [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the bank. However, the ECB increased the volume of the
emergency purchase program for PEPP bonds by another 600 billion euros.
In March, the regulator announced the allocation of 750 billion euros
for this purpose. Now, the total volume of the PEPP program will be 1.35
trillion euro.

As the ECB head Christine Lagarde said at a subsequent press conference,
the fall of the European economy has no precedent, and current macro
data indicate a serious deterioration in the labor market and a serious
drop in economic activity.

Volatility in trading on the euro may increase sharply if the minutes
from the ECB meeting in June contain unexpected statements or new
information regarding the prospects of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).

###  **12:30 USD Initial jobless claims in the US over the past week. US
annual GDP for the 1st quarter (final estimate). Orders for capital
goods (ex defense and aviation)**

The situation on the country's labor market is still deteriorating. Back
in February, the indicator of initial claims for unemployment benefits
was within its average values ​​of 193-252 thousand. However, then the
situation began to deteriorate sharply. Over the week of March 22-28,
6.9 million claims were submitted, then 6.606 million claims, shocking
observers and market participants. A similar indicator published last
Thursday (for the week of June 7 - June 13) came out with a value of
1.508 million new claims.

The US Department of Labor data published in early May showed an
increase in unemployment in the country to the level of 14.7%. In May,
the US unemployment rate was 13.3%. Economists attribute this to the
coronavirus, which has damaged the US economy. Many US companies
announced layoffs, and authorities ordered non-vital companies to close
their offices and stores in the wake of the coronavirus epidemic.
Current weekly growth rates of claims far exceed the previous record
level of 695,000, reached in October 1982. Then the number of initial
claims filed in four weeks was 2.7 million.

This indicator (the number of new claims for unemployment benefits)
reflects the state of the labor market. An increase in value negatively
affects consumption and economic growth. Under normal conditions, a high
result weakens the US dollar, while a low one strengthens it. However,
under current conditions (the coronavirus pandemic and a sharp economic
slowdown), the reaction of market participants to the publication of
this report by the US Department of Labor can be completely
unpredictable.

 **US annual GDP for the 1st quarter (final estimate).** GDP data is one
of the key indicators (along with labor market data and inflation) for
the Fed in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of its monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). A strong result strengthens the
US dollar; weak GDP report negatively affects the US dollar. In the
previous 4th quarter, GDP growth amounted to +2.1%. The preliminary
forecast for the 1st quarter of 2020 was -4.1%, but actually turned out
to be -5.0%. The data already takes into account the impact of
coronavirus on the US economy. However, experts predict an even stronger
slowdown in the 2nd quarter. It is likely that the publication of the
data will cause a short-term decline in the dollar. Data weaker than the
forecast may even more negatively affect the dollar quotes.

 **Orders for capital goods (ex defense and aviation).** This indicator
reflects the value of orders received by producers of capital goods
(capital goods are durable commodities used for the production of
durable goods and services) involving large investments. Goods
manufactured in the defense and aviation sectors of the US economy are
not included in this indicator. A high result strengthens the USD.
Previous indicator values: -6.1% in April, -0.8% (in March), -0.9% (in
February), +1.0% (in January). In theory, the relative growth of the
indicator has a positive effect on the dollar. However, the reaction of
the market to its negative value may be negative for the dollar in the
short term. Data worse than the previous value will also negatively
affect dollar quotes. Forecast for May: -10%.

###  **23:30 JPY Tokyo Consumer Price Index (CPI) (ex fresh food)**

This consumer price index published by the Bureau of Statistics of Japan
reflects an estimate of price dynamics obtained by comparing the retail
prices of the corresponding basket of goods and services. The CPI Tokyo
index, excluding fresh food prices, which is an important barometer of
changes in consumer trends, came out in March with a value of +0.4%, and
in April with a negative value of -0.1% (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)). Forecast for
June: -0.2%. Japan's inflation is still low. Relative growth of the
indicator can strengthen the yen in the short-term. However, a decrease
in the indicator will negatively affect the yen.

During the publication of CPI indices, volatility is expected to
increase in yen quotes and in the Japanese stock market, especially if
actual values ​​will differ significantly from the forecasts.

###  **Friday, June 26**

No important macro statistics planned to be released.
