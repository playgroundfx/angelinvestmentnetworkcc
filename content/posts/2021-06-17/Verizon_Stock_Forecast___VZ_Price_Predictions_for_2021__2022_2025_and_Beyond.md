Verizon Stock Prediction: Is It More Than a Great Dividend Stock?Jana
Kane

Shares in Verizon entered 2021 with the past year’s downtrend still
going strong. And while the same can be said about many companies
disrupted by the pandemic, this company has been consistently
underperforming for some time. But while it has not been a steady ride,
the stock has still attracted income-oriented [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s with its annual
dividend.

The overarching question is now whether [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s should have higher
hopes for the stock. There may be signs of potential earnings
acceleration in future years, along with growing capital returns.

Verizon holds a [dominant ][2][market][2][ position][2], with its
biggest competitor being AT&T. Each of the companies is roughly twice
the size of smaller rivals T-Mobile and Sprint. This allows Verizon to
have the financial flexibility to keep up the trend of advancing the
network, returning capital to shareholders, and acquiring new companies.

The current price of a Verizon share is 56.53 USD.

## Which Factors Impact Verizon Communications Inc.?

We’ve divided factors that influence the Verizon Communications stock
price into several categories.

### Economic Factors

If the following parameters are stable or on the rise, the VZ price
strengthens accordingly:

  * Infrastructure quality
  * Exchange rates and stability of a host country’s currency
  * Business cycle stage (e.g., prosperity, recovery)

### Political Factors

The systematic risks in the political environment that could negatively
affect both the projected and real stock prices are as follows:

  * Bureaucracy and interference in telecom services
  * Taxation and level of corruption
  * Trade [regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/)s and tariffs
  * Industrial safety [regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/)s

### Technological Factors

In the technology sector, the biggest impact is made by:

  * Recent technological developments by Verizon and competitors
  * Technology-led product offering
  * Rate of technological diffusion

By actively tackling the problems and delivering new solutions within
each group, Verizon has every opportunity to drive its stock to higher
levels. Namely, the new 5G Wireless technology might revolutionize
virtual reality (VR), mixed reality (XR), and augmented reality (AR).

### Social Factors

The last category that has a strong effect on the VZ price includes:

  * Demographics and skill level of the population
  * Culture (gender roles, social conventions, etc.)
  * Leisure interests

If Verizon Communications Inc. understands the customers of a given
market from a social perspective, it leads to better product and service
offerings, ultimately resulting in a higher stock quote.

## Analysts’ Verizon Stock Projections for 2021

Is Verizon stock a buy right now? Based on 13 Wall Street analysts that
have issued their ratings and [12-month price targets][3], the consensus
rating is “Hold”, and the average price target is $62.46. But let’s take
a closer look at several of the most recent analyst recommendations.

### HSBC

HSBC placed their price target on Verizon Communications at $62 from
$58, maintaining a “Hold” rating. The firm added that Verizon remained
strategically well-positioned as it scales in the wireless sector while
offering a decent dividend yield.

### Moffett Nathanson

At Moffett Nathanson, analyst Craig Moffett downgraded his rating from
“Buy” to “Neutral”. He added that Verizon previously had an attractive
financial outlook, but the situation has become less clear now. It might
even be on track to lose its best-network title.

### OPPENHEIMER HLD

The Verizon Communications stock forecast by Timothy Horan from
Oppenheimer is less eventful. In a report released recently, the analyst
maintained a Hold rating on the company.

### Tigress Financial Partners

Tigress Financial Partners turned bullish on Verizon Communications Inc.
Analyst Ivan Feinseth upgraded the company from “Neutral” to “Buy”. In
the upgrade note, he noted that after ending 2020 with a full-year
revenue decline of 2.71%, Verizon seemed to reverse its losses and was
on track to generate higher revenue this year.

### Bank of America

Bank of America reiterated their “Buy” rating as well as a price target
set at $64. The impact on the share price is considered medium.

## Technical Analysis of the VZ Price

Let’s apply chart scanning tools to get an assessment of [VZ][1] stock
from a technical perspective.

The price has broken below the trendline. However, SMI Ergodic
Oscillator is near the lower boundary of the range, which means there is
a possibility of price recovery. This signal will be confirmed as soon
as the 50 moving average line crosses the 200 MA bottom up.

Below are the support and resistance levels at the time of writing (June
3, 2021) calculated with Classic Pivot Points on a 1D timeframe:

  * S3: 49.79
  * S2: 53.62
  * S1: 55.06
  * P: 57.45
  * R1: 58.89
  * R2: 61.28
  * R3: 65.11

This forecast is pessimistic as it anticipates the price falling in
2025. There aren’t any other resources listing specific numbers. But to
even opinions out, here is why Verizon may _not_ go in the bearish
direction.

5G will cover [25% of the world's population][7] by 2030. And since
Verizon is one of the first companies to implement this technology, it’s
likely to have a strong standing in a market forecasted to grow to
[around $720 billion][8] in the next 10 years (compared to the current
$41.48 billion).

## Recent Price History of the VZ Stock

The question of “Why is Verizon stock down?” is a tricky one as the
[VZ][1] stock hasn’t been the most stable one recently. We will briefly
go over a few key moments and try to find the underlying cause for
[historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) price changes:

  * July 2017: Verizon data of 6 million users was leaked online, at which point the stock went through a downtrend and traded at around $43.
  * January 2018: Total consolidated revenue growth, which pushed the trading price up to 54 US dollars.
  * March 2018: Declining subscribership (dropping to $46).
  * November 2018: Verizon's 5G takes a giant leap toward mobility availability, putting the stock up to $60.

  * February 2019: Unsuccessful launch of another BOGO (buy one, get one free) deal, driving Verizon Communications, Inc. shares down to $53.
  * March 2019: Deployment of mobile 5G “ultra wideband” network in Chicago and Minneapolis (moving the price higher to $57).
  * May 2019: A data breach brought the price back down to $54.
  * December 2019: Revenue growth from Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals pushed the price to an impressive $62.

  * March 2020: The stock market crashed globally - with the price crashing to $51.
  * April 2020: Strong demand in network services - $58.
  * June 2020: The quarterly revenue report revealed that the total operating revenue fell due to a decline in device sales amid lockdown-led store closures. The stock price plunged to $53 at the time.
  * August 2020: Announcement of unlimited plans (shifting upwards to the $60 mark).
  * February 2021: News about a phishing scam targeting Verizon customers pushed the price down to $54.
  * May 2021: Verizon redeems itself and reaches the $58 mark.

Going all-in on 5G is considered a risky bet. But on a more positive
note, let’s take a second look at where Verizon excels. Despite the
pandemic uncertainty and stiff competition with AT&T, Verizon managed to
deliver solid end-of-year results in 2020 and rewarded shareholders with
a dividend this year.

As long as Verizon keeps its network stable and reliable, it should be
able to attract and retain business regardless of the economic
situation. This makes the [VZ][1] stock an attractive option for growth
and income [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s.
