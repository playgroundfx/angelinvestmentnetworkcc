Altria Stock Forecast: Will High Dividends Beat Negative Outlooks?Jana
Kane

Altria Group is one of the leading US tobacco manufacturers and sellers.
However, the company's shares have a low value. What are the reasons
behind this? Let's look at analysts' MO stock forecast and factors that
will either boost Altria stocks or pull them down.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Altria Group, Inc. Stock: a Brief Overview

[Altria Group][1], Inc. (previously named Philip Morris Companies) is
one of the world's largest manufacturers and sellers of tobacco,
cigarettes, and related products. Altria is a parent company of Philip
Morris USA, Philip Morris Capital Corporation, John Middleton Inc., Nat
Sherman, Nu Mark, US Smokeless Tobacco Company Inc., and Chateau Ste.
Michelle wine estates.

Its key operation segments are Smokeable Products, Smokeless Products
and Wine. The Smokeable Products segment consists of cigarettes produced
and sold by PM USA and large machine-made cigars and pipe tobacco
manufactured and sold by Middleton. The smokeless products are produced
and sold by or on behalf of USSTC and PM USA. The company is a producer
of Washington State wines. Altria owns wineries and distributes wines
from several other wine regions.

Check out some data on [Altria's stocks][2] (New York Stock Exchange: MO):

  * Market cap: $92.11 billion

  * Shares outstanding: 1.85 billion

  * Public float: 1.85 billion

  * P/E ratio: 21.36

  * Payout ratio: 75.27% (based on this year's estimates)

  * EPS: 2.33 

  * Dividend Yield: 6.91%

  * 52-Week Range: 35.83 - 52.59

  * Annual dividend: $3.44

  * MO Three Year Dividend Growth: 0.00%

  * Average volume: 9.26 million shares

The company was founded in 1919. It’s conveniently headquartered in
Henrico County, Virginia. However, the firm has had only 5 stock splits.
The first one took place on June 3, 1974; this was a 2:1 split. Altria's
4th stock split was held on October 11, 1989, with a 4:1 ratio. The last
split was on April 11, 1997 (3 stocks prorated to 1). Historically, when
such industry giants as Altria Group hold stock splits, market
capitalization before and after the event is stable, which means the
stockholders get more shares. Still, each one is valued at a lower
price.

How much is MO stock today? The current price is 46.84 US dollars.

MO's Return on Equity is predicted to be 318.5% vs. 136.05% (industry)
and 44.88% (market) in 3 years (by December 31, 2023). Analysts are sure
the company will be able to generate a return on equity efficiently.

## Major Factors That Affect The Altria Group, Inc. Share Price in 2021
& Beyond

We won't talk about common factors that impact the stock price direction
of any company. Just to mention them, they include financial outlook,
earnings reports, global political and economic events, internal company
[news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/), and events in the industry. Let's discover what can impact Altria
stocks in particular.

### Loss of Customers

Fewer and fewer people smoke cigarettes and use other tobacco products.
Just to compare, in 1965, over 40% of American adults smoked cigarettes.
In 2018, this number decreased to 10%. Other statistics show that the
percentage of those who smoke cigarettes in large quantities per day has
declined. Tobacco businesses are under threat.

Altria can't control this process. There won’t be such strong demand
anymore. Thus, it will keep losing its customers without the ability to
turn the situation in its favor. Moreover, it's unlikely the situation
will improve in the future. Although the company raised prices, this
strategy isn't effective in the long term as authorities worldwide keep
putting sanctions on tobacco products. Altria will continue struggling.

### Weak Investments

The company's 35% stake in JUUL plunged from $12.8 billion to $1.5
billion (March 2021). An investment in a cannabis company Cronos
resulted in a loss of over $200 million.

Currently, FTC has been trying to prove that Altria, forced by JUUL,
pulled its e-cigarettes off the market illegally as the two companies
were discussing a deal. The Federal Trade Commission wants to unwind
this deal.

Still, there are two promising Altria brands - iQOS, the heated tobacco
developed by Philip Morris International, and On nicotine pouches. If
these brands succeed, the stocks will rise.

### Regulations

Altria tries to contribute to tobacco [regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/). For instance, the
company supported legislation to raise the minimum age for all tobacco
products to 21.

However, there are other aspects that can negatively affect the value of
its stocks. Any restrictions on manufacturing and selling alongside tax
refund issues will lead to a depreciation in shares.

### Covid-19 and Its Effects

Coronavirus causes problems with the lungs. It’s logical that Covid-19
will continue to affect different industries, including the tobacco one.
Cigarette consumption will further decrease.

## Altria Stock Prediction for 2021: Analysts’ Recommendations

Will Altria still go up? The average 12-month price target by [12 Wall
Street analysts][3] is $51.10. The highest possible price is USD 58.00;
the lowest potential rate is $43.00. The consensus rating is "Buy" as 8
out of 12 analysts set it. 4 analysts claim a holding rating.

### Morgan Stanley

Analysts at Morgan Stanley boosted the price target for Altria stocks to
$52 from $49. The rating is overweight.

### Kristina Ruggeri, Argus Research

Kristina Ruggeri at Argus Research lowered the rating to "Hold" from
"Buy" without a price target.

### Stifel Nicolaus

A full-service brokerage and investment banking firm reiterated the
"Buy" rating and placed the stock quote target at USD 56.

### Piper Sandler

Analysts at Piper Sandler maintained the "Buy" rating. The price
expectation is $57.

### Owen Bennett, Jefferies Financial Group

Owen Bennett upgraded the "Hold" rating to "Buy," improved the Altria
Group, Inc. share forecast to $58 from $40.

upcoming price performance. The current trend is uncertain. The price

## MO Stock Forecast for 2022

What is the future of [Altria stocks][2]? There won’t be an increase
next year. Wallet Investor has a weak MO stock price forecast both for
2021 and 2022. The opening price projection in January next year is
$45.270, the closing price in December the same year is set at $38.608.

The source predicts a long-term downtrend. The maximum and minimum rates
will be near or the same as the opening/closing prices throughout the
year. This signals limited market fluctuations. Although low volatility
is positive for long-term [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s, Altria shares are not the best
option to invest in.

Still, not all the MO stock projections are so negative. The 5-year
Altria stock price forecast of [Gov.capital][5] is 401.272.

Long-term projections are subject to uncertainties as too many factors
affect the volatile stock market. The situation can change rapidly.
Thus, MO stock predictions for the long run should be taken with a grain
of salt.

## Altria's Price History: Timeline

Historical accuracy is a crucial part of stock price prediction. History
repeats itself. Even last month’s price fluctuations will provide ideas
on the future price direction. Thus, knowing the reasons for previous
stock performance, we have a clue to possible price movements.

The all-time high of $89.40 was set on January 11, 2007. Since then, the
price hasn’t come close to that level. Why was Altria going down? A
drastic plunge occurred on March 30, when the company announced its
plans to spin off Kraft Food. The enterprise owned 84% of the Kraft
company. In March 2008, another dramatic fall happened when Altria spun
off Philip Morris International.

The attempt to set a new all-time high took place on June 19, 2017, when
the stock peaked at $77.78. Nevertheless, the rally didn't last for a
long time. Within 4 days (July 27-31), the rate plunged from $73.96 to
$64.97.

An FDA announcement caused a dramatic decline. The Food and Drug
Administration said it planned a new tobacco and nicotine [regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/),
which was anticipated to shorten nicotine in cigarettes to non-addictive
levels. The agency was going to review many aspects of the [regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/) to
produce new products that were less harmful than cigarettes.

The price could recover only by December 19, when it reached $74.38.
However, it was only a short-term uptrend within the overall dramatic
plunge that started in the middle of 2017 and is still in place.

In 2018, the stocks struggled due to the inability to move away from
cigarettes and surprisingly awful investments in marijuana-grower Cronos
Group and e-cigarettes maker JUUL at the end of the year.

The first drastic decline occurred in April as analysts downgraded the
stocks, and Philip Morris reported weak growth from its IQOS product in
Japan. Starting the year at $71.51, the stocks plunged to $49.39 on
December 31.

The downtrend wasn't broken in 2019. The price was sliding during the
year. There was a significant surge in November when the firm reported
strong third-quarter financial data. Quarterly revenue increased by 2%.
The report could boost the price, so 2019 was closed at acceptable
levels of near to $50.

The rise didn’t last long as coronavirus hit the financial markets at
the beginning of 2020. Covid-19, a disease that affects the lungs,
wouldn’t contribute to the future growth of the cigarette manufacturer.
The price fell to $30 by the second half of March. During the rest of
the year, the stocks were stable, fluctuating within the $35-$44 range.

The beginning of 2021 has turned out to be promising for Altria's
shares. In March, the price managed to top $52.59. However, analysts'
price predictions don't encourage this positive trend.

## Is It Good to Invest in Altria (MO)?

How much will Altria stock be worth in 10 years? Although AI Pickup LLC
predicts a strong bullish trend for the next 10 years, there are high
risks for the Altria stock value. Firstly, the company can't control the
shortage of tobacco consumption. Secondly, the coronavirus pandemic and
its effects won't allow the company to increase sales.

Also, one should keep in mind that such a long-term prognosis is not
accurate as there are many factors that can affect the company's value.
Thus, there is no guarantee that the stock price predictions will work.

The high yield of Altria stocks is attractive. However, if we compare
the MO price with the total return, which considers reinvested
dividends, we will see that the dividends don't compensate for the long-
term decline in shares. As a result, Altria stocks are not recommended
for long-term investment.

Trading is an alternative that allows earning on up- and downward price
movements. As [Altria's stock value][2] is hardly predictable, it's
worth starting to trade on a demo account. A Liteforex demo account
provides real market conditions and an opportunity to pick up a tool
among a wide range of technical indicators, which will help you gain
experience without losing money.
