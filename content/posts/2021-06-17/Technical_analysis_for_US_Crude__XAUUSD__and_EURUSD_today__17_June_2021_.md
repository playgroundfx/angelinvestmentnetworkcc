Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 17.06.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

The euro false breakout sell pattern in the Additional Zone 1.2141 -
1.2136 yielded profits.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

Yesterday, after the Micro-zone 71.87 - 71.81 yielded profits according
to the recommendation and the local high was updated the oil price went
into correction. As a result, the Additional Zone 71.41 - 71.27, which
serves as a strong support, was reached. It is possible to enter
purchases according to the pattern in the beforementioned AZ. The target
for purchases will be level 72.57.

If the Additional zone is broken out during today's trading session,
then it will be possible to consider sales with a target in the
Intermediary Zone 70.08 - 69.82.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

Buy according to the pattern in Additional Zone 71.41 - 71.27.
TakeProfit: 72.57. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

The gold sell pattern yielded profits with a target at level 1845. As a
result, the June 14 low was updated. The Gold Zone 1835 - 1833 and
Target Zone 2 1813 - 1808 were also reached.

Now traders are testing Target Zone 2 in order to break it out and
consolidate the price below. If successful, the downtrend will continue,
and the Gold Zone 2 1790 - 1788 will become the target for taking
profits.

Enter new gold sales on corrections at strong resistances, for example,
the Additional Zone 1828 - 1826.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

Sell according to the pattern in Additional Zone 1828 - 1826.
TakeProfit: 1804. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

The euro false breakout sell pattern in the Additional Zone 1.2141 -
1.2136 yielded profits. Level 1.2096 has been tested. The Target Zone
1.2090 - 1.2072 was broken out. As a result, the price reached the Gold
Zone 1.2002 - 1.1993.

Now the bears are trying to break out the Gold Zone and lower the price
to the Target Zone 2 1.1914 - 1.1896.

It is reasonable to consider new euro sales on corrections at strong
resistances. The first significant resistance is the Additional Zone
1.2021 - 1.2017. The short-term downtrend's border is located at the
levels 1.2070 - 1.2061.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

Sell according to the pattern in Additional Zone 1.2021 - 1.2017.
TakeProfit: 1.1975. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.
