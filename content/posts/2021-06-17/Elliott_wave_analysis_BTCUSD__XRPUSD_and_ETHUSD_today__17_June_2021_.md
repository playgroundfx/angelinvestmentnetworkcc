Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 17.06.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

The ETHUSD market seems to be forming a corrective wave as a triple
zigzag.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

The BTCUSD market has started forming a large impulse down wave. The
first leg of this wave, impulse [1], completed. There is developing the
corrective up wave [2] as a simple zigzag (A)-(B)-(C). There is
unfolding the final wave (C) of this zigzag as a five-wave impulse.
There have completed sub-waves 1-2-3-4, the final wave 5 has just
started unfolding. Therefore, the price should be rising in wave 5 to a
level of 44500.00, where wave [2] will retrace wave [1] by 50%.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 38856.40, TP 44500.00

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

The most recent section of the XRPUSD chart displays the final wave Y,
an element of wave (X), unfolding as a double zigzag. Wave Y is composed
of sub-waves [W]-[X]-[Y], where the first two sub-waves seem to have
completed. There is forming the beginning of the upward wave [Y], which
is likely to be a simple zigzag (A)-(B)-(C). Therefore, the price should
be following this zigzag up to a level of 1.202, as outline in the
chart. At this level, wave (X) will be 38.2% оf wave (W).

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] today:

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

The ETHUSD market, like the BTCUSD, is forming the inceptive par of the
new impulse wave. The bearish wave 1 has completed as a five-wave
impulse. There is now developing corrective wave 2 as a triple zigzag
[W]-[X]-[Y]-[X]-[Z]. The final leg of this zigzag also looks like a
triple zigzag, composed of the sub-waves (W)-(X)-(Y)-(X)-(Z). Wave (Z)
should conclude the entire correction 2 at a level of 2940.00. At this
level, wave 2 will be 38.2% of wave 1.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:
