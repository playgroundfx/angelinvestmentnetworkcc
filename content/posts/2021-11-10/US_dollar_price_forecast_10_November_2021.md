Dollar: wag the dog. Forecast as of 10.11.2021Dmitri Demidenko

While the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the Fed and the ECB is quite transparent,
other central banks try to draw [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s’ attention. How does this
affect dollar pairs in general and [EURUSD][1] in particular? Let us
discuss the Forex outlook and make up a trading plan.

## Fundamental US dollar forecast today

Сentral banks’ unwillingness to tighten monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) in response to
the inflation rise is pushing real interest rates down. It hasn’t been
since the 1970s! On the one hand, this reduces debt servicing costs and
allows governments to increase the debt. On the other hand, it inflates
bubbles in asset markets and exacerbates the risks of financial
instability. For example, the [S&P 500][2] recorded eight new all-time
highs in a row, which has not happened since 1997. The correction of the
US stock index discouraged the [EURUSD][1] bulls, luring [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s back
safe havens.

Currently, the difference between nominal rates and inflation is -5.3%
in the US, -4.6% in Germany, and -3% in Britain. Without tightening
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), central banks will continue the party for financial
markets, but they will have to take away the punch bowl sooner or later.
Many regulators start considering raising the rates.

### Dynamics of real interest rates

Of the issuers of G10 currencies, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand has
already raised interest rates, and the Bank of Canada has finished the
QE. Expectations that the Bank of England would follow their path
inflated bond yields around the world, but frustration with its
reluctance to raise borrowing costs led to a sharp drop in yields. As a
result, a rather curious situation is developing in the world economy,
when the regulators of small economies influence the US and global debt
markets more than the Fed. It looks like the tail wagging the dog.

I have many times pointed out that the willingness of some central banks
to be ahead of the Fed in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of monetary tightening creates a
division between the dollar and other currencies. Hawkish signals of
central banks other than the Fed strengthen the entire class of
currencies. Differently put, the BoE’s refusal to hike the interest rate
pressed down not only the pound but the euro as well. However, Andrew
Bailey claimed that the BoE would still be tightened, which supported
both the sterling and the euro.

The euro has also been supported by the [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) that the ZEW indicator of
economic sentiment for Germany increased for the first time over the
past 6 months. Due to disruptions in supply chains, Germany is turning
from the locomotive of the euro-area economic growth into its brake, so
the good [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) from Berlin supported the [EURUSD][1] bulls. However, the
US producer price index increase by 0.6% from the prior month and 8.6%
from a year earlier and the [S&P 500][2] correction did not allow euro
buyers to consolidate the price above figure 16 against the US dollar.

### [EURUSD][1] trading plan today

The indicator change suggests the US inflation should remain high for a
longer time than the Fed expects, and it can further increase. The
growth of consumer prices by 0.8% M-o-M in October could be a reason to
continue selling the [EURUSD][1] if the price breaks out the support at
1.157. Bloomberg analysts expect the US CPI to increase 0.6% M-o-M and
5.8% Y-o-Y.
