Economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the week 25.10.2021 – 31.10.2021Jana Kane

##  **Review of the main events of the Forex economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the
next trading week (25.10.2021 – 31.10.2021)**

Speaking on Friday at the conference to mark the centenary of the
Virtual Bank for International Settlements, the Fed Chairman Jerome
Powell reaffirmed the bank's plan to cut bond purchases, but lowered the
likelihood of interest rate hikes in the coming months.

“Coping with the pandemic is key to the global economy,” was one of the
first tenets in Powell's speech. He expects that "higher inflation is
likely to be longer than anticipated," but a rate hike now "would be
premature." “Now is the time to wind down stimulus, not hike rates, and
the Fed is on track to complete the stimulus winding process by
mid-2022,” Powell said, adding that “The Fed will raise rates if it sees
serious inflationary risks". In his opinion, "the Fed's [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) is well
tuned."

The dollar mostly strengthened after Powell's speech. Nevertheless, the
DXY dollar index nevertheless declined last week, while US stock indices
rose, ending with an increase for the third week in a row. One way or
another, the Fed's [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) will remain soft. Even if the Fed begins to
gradually reduce the volume of purchases in the bond market, the
interest rate will remain near zero levels for a long time.

Next week, financial market participants will pay attention to the
publication of important macro statistics from Australia, the US,
Germany, and the Eurozone. But the main focus will be on the results of
the meetings of the central banks of Canada, Japan, and the Eurozone.

 ***during the coming week, new events may be added to the [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) and
/ or some scheduled events may be canceled**

 ****GMT time**

###  **Monday, October 25**

No important macro statistics scheduled to be released.

###  **Tuesday, October 26**

###  **08:00 EUR Euro Area Bank Lending Survey**

The survey on the state of the bank lending system is conducted by EU
financial experts 4 times a year. The main goal of the survey is to
obtain expanded information on the conditions of bank lending in the
Eurozone.

The obtained data are used by the ECB management when making decisions
on the bank's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). This report may cause increased
volatility in the euro quotes and on the European stock market at the
time of its publication if it contains unexpected conclusions regarding
the [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of lending to businesses and households in the Eurozone.

###  **Wednesday, October 27**

###  **00:30 AUD RBA trimmed mean core inflation index (Q3). Consumer
Price Index (Q3)**

This indicator is published by the RBA and the Australian Bureau of
Statistics. It reflects the dynamics of retail prices of goods and
services included in the consumer basket. The simple trimmed mean method
takes into account the weighted average kernel, the central 70% of the
index components. Previous index values: + 0.5% (+ 1.6% YoY) in Q2, +
0.3% (+ 1.1% YoY) in Q1 2021, +0 , 4% (+ 1.2% YoY) in Q4 2020. According
to the forecast, it is expected that the value of the indicator for the
3rd quarter of 2021 will be + 0.5% (+ 1.6% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)). Despite the
continuing dynamics, this is still a weak indicator. If the value of the
indicator turns out to be worse than the forecast, it is likely to
further negatively affect the AUD. The data indicate low inflationary
pressures in the country. The growth of the indicator above the forecast
should have a positive effect on the AUD in the short term.

Consumer Price Inflation Index (CPI) published by the RBA and the
Australian Bureau of Statistics measures the dynamics of retail prices
for goods and services in Australia. CPI is the most significant
indicator of inflation and changes in consumer preferences. A high
reading is positive for the AUD, while a low reading is negative.
Previous values ​​of the indicator: + 0.8% (+ 3.8% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) in
the 2nd quarter, + 0.6% (+ 1.1% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) in the 1st quarter of
2021, +0.9% (+ 0.9% YoY) in Q4 2020. According to the forecast, it is
expected that the value of the indicator for the 3rd quarter of 2021
will be + 0.7% (+ 3.8% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)). The CPI inflation target of the
Australian central bank is in the range of 2% - 3%. As follows from the
minutes of the October meeting of the RBA, “The Central Bank will not
raise rates until it reaches the target CPI inflation level of 2-3% on a
stable basis. This will not happen until 2024. "

Thus, the expected positive reading is likely to still not provide
significant support for the AUD. If the indicator comes out with a value
worse than forecast, it will negatively affect the AUD in the short
term.

###  **12:30 USD Durable goods orders. Capital goods orders (ex defense
and aviation)**

This indicator reflects the value of orders received by manufacturers of
durable goods and capital goods (capital goods are durable commodities
used to produce durable goods and services) involving large investments.
Commodities produced in the defense and aviation sectors of the US
economy are not included in this indicator. A strong result strengthens
the USD. Previous values ​​of the indicator "durable goods orders": +
1.8% in August, -0.1% in July, + 0.9% in June, + 2.3% in May, -1.3% in
April , + 1% in March, -1.2% in February, + 3.4% in January 2021.

Previous values ​​of the indicator "capital goods orders ex defense and
aviation": + 0.6% in August, 0% in July, + 0.7% in June, + 0.1% in May,
+ 2.2% in April, + 1% in March, -0.9% in February, + 0.6% in January
2021.

Theoretically, the relative growth of the indicator has a positive
effect on the dollar, while the decline in the indicator is negative.
The market reaction to its negative value can also be negative for the
dollar in the short term. Data worse than the previous value and / or
forecast will also negatively affect the dollar quotes.

Forecast for September: -0.2% (durable goods orders), 0% (capital goods
orders ex defense and aviation).

It looks like the growth of indicators has slowed down, although it
continues after their recovery in previous months from a sharp drop in
March and April 2020, which should negatively affect the dollar quotes.
Better-than-forecast data will have a positive impact on the dollar.

###  **14:00 CAD Bank of Canada's decision on interest rate. Bank of
Canada's accompanying statement. Bank of Canada Monetary Policy
Committee Report**

The Bank of Canada will decide on the interest rate. In March 2020, the
bank lowered the rate 3 times, bringing it to the level of 0.25%, to
mitigate the economic damage from the novel coronavirus pandemic.

In an accompanying statement, the central bank of Canada said that the
decision "aims to support the financial system, which plays a central
role in lending to the economy, as well as to create a foundation that
will allow the economy to return to normal." The central bank also said
in a press release that the spread of the coronavirus and the plummeting
global oil prices combined are weighing heavily on Canadians and the
Canadian economy.

In fact, quantitative easing and a significant cut in the interest rate
should contribute to the weakening of the national currency.

According to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics in late
August, Canada's GDP contracted 1.1% in the second quarter (on an
annualized basis), while economists had forecast its growth by 2.5%.
Many economists have lowered their forecast for the growth of the
Canadian economy in 2021.

The negative effects of the coronavirus on the Canadian economy and the
country's labor market, as well as the weakness of the housing market,
are putting pressure on the Bank of Canada to further ease monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).

However, the Bank of Canada is expected to keep its interest rate at
0.25% at its meeting on Wednesday.

Tough tone of the accompanying statement by the Bank of Canada on rising
inflation and the prospects for further tightening of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
will cause the Canadian dollar to strengthen. If the Bank of Canada
signals the need for soft monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), the Canadian currency will
decline.

The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Canada will release its
next quarterly report on current monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), containing information
on changes in monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). In this report, representatives of the
Bank of Canada will explain the bank's position and assess the current
economic situation in the country. Tough tone of the report will cause
the Canadian dollar to strengthen. If the Bank of Canada signals to
extend the period of maintaining a soft monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), the Canadian
currency will decline.

###  **15:15 CAD Press conference of the Bank of Canada**

During the press conference, head of the Bank of Canada Tiff Macklem
will explain the bank's position and assess the current economic
situation in the country. If the tone of his speech is tough on the
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the Bank of Canada, the Canadian dollar will
strengthen in the foreign exchange market. If Macklem speaks out for
maintaining a soft monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), the Canadian currency will decline.
In any case, high volatility in the CAD quotes is expected during the
period of his speech.

###  **Thursday, October 28**

###  **03:00 JPY** Bank of Japan's decision on interest rate. Bank of
Japan's press conference and monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) comments

The Bank of Japan will decide on the interest rate. At the moment, the
main rate in Japan is in negative territory, amounting to -0.1%. Most
likely, the rate will remain the same. If it is cut and deepens into
negative territory, such a decision will cause a sharp decline in the
yen in the foreign exchange market and an increase in the Japanese stock
market. In any case, during this period of time, a jump in volatility is
expected in trading in the yen and in the Asian financial market.

Since February 2016, the Bank of Japan has kept the deposit rate at
-0.1%. The target yield for 10-year bonds is currently around 0%. One of
the recent accompanying statements by the Bank of Japan said that the
bank's management will continue to "increase the monetary base until
inflation is stable above 2%." “We will not hesitate to take additional
mitigation measures if necessary,” the bank also traditionally said in a
statement.

During the press conference, the head of the Bank of Japan Haruhiko
Kuroda will comment on the bank's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). The Bank of Japan
continues to adhere to its super-soft monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). As Kuroda has
stated on several occasions, "it is appropriate for Japan to patiently
continue with its current loose monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)." Markets usually react
actively to Kuroda's speeches. Surely, he will again touch upon the
topic of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) during his speech, which will cause an increase
in volatility not only in the yen trade, but also throughout the Asian
and world financial markets.

If the bank's executives decide that the Japanese economy is stable and
the momentum of inflation towards the 2% target is not diminishing, they
will refrain from changing [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).

###  **06:00** **JPY Press conference of the Bank of Japan**

During the press conference, head of the Bank of Japan Haruhiko Kuroda
will comment on the bank's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). Despite the measures taken
earlier by the bank to stimulate the Japanese economy, inflation remains
low, production and consumption are falling, which negatively affects
export-oriented Japanese manufacturers. Markets usually react actively
to Kuroda's speeches. If he touches on the topic of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
during his speech, volatility will increase not only in the yen trade,
but throughout the Asian and global financial markets.

###  **11:45 EUR ECB's decision on rates**

The ECB will publish its decision on the key rate and on the deposit
rate. The ECB's tough stance on inflation and key interest rates
contributes to the strengthening of the euro, while the soft stance and
rate cuts weaken the euro. In September 2019, the European Central Bank
lowered its key interest rate on deposits by 0.1%, to -0.5%, for the
first time since March 2016, and began buying bonds worth 20 billion
euros a month, renewing the so-called quantitative easing program.
According to the ECB leadership, the balance of risks for the economic
prospects of the Eurozone "is still shifted to the negative side", and
"until inflation is in line" with the target level, which is just below
2%, the rate will remain low. The new forecasts of the ECB on rates and
the QE program can be viewed as a signal of the inclination to further
soften [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) amid unwilling inflation to accelerate.

After Brexit, trade conflicts, factors of political instability in
Europe, as well as the growing coronavirus pandemic, due to which
European countries are forced to introduce new quarantine restrictions
that negatively affect economic activity, are the main threats to the
European economy. Back in March 2020, the ECB signaled the possibility
of [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) easing, and the bank's representative admitted that the bank's
management could lower the already negative interest rates even more.

Probably, following the results of this ECB meeting, the key interest
rate will remain at the same level of 0%. The ECB's rate on deposits for
commercial banks is also likely to remain at -0.5%.

###  **12:00 EUR Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) in Germany
(preliminary release)**

This index is published by the EU Statistical Office and is calculated
on the basis of a statistical method agreed between all EU countries. It
is an indicator for assessing inflation and is used by the Governing
Council of the ECB to assess the level of price stability. A positive
result strengthens the EUR, a negative one weakens it.

Previous values ​​of the indicator: + 4.1% in September, + 3.4% in
August, + 3.1% in July, + 2.1% in June, + 2.4% in May, + 2.1% in April,
+ 2.0% in March, + 1.6% in January and February, -0.7% in December and
negative values ​​in the second half of 2020 (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)). If the
data for October turn out to be better than the previous values, the
euro may strengthen in the short term. The growth of the indicator is a
positive factor for the euro. The data suggests increasing inflationary
pressures in Germany. Data worse than the previous value will negatively
affect the euro.

###  **12:30 USD US Annual GDP for 3rd Quarter (first preliminary
estimate)**

GDP data is one of the key indicators (along with data on the labor
market and inflation) for the Fed in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of its monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). A
strong result strengthens the US dollar; a weak GDP report negatively
affects the US dollar. In the previous 2nd quarter, GDP grew by + 6.7%,
in the 1st quarter of 2021 by + 6.4%, in the 4th quarter of 2020 - by +
4.3% after growing by + 33.4% in Q3 2020, and after falling -31.4% in Q2
and -5.0% in Q1 2020.

If the data points to a decline in GDP in the 3rd quarter, then the
dollar will come under pressure. The positive data on GDP will support
the dollar and the American stock indices, although they are already
mostly included in prices. First preliminary forecast for Q3 2021: +
2.5%.

###  **13:30 EUR Press conference of the ECB**

The press conference will be of primary interest to market participants.
During it, a surge in volatility is possible not only in the euro
quotes, but also in the entire financial market, if the ECB leaders make
unexpected statements. The ECB leaders will assess the current economic
situation in the Eurozone and comment on the bank's decision on rates.
In previous years, based on the results of some ECB meetings and
subsequent press conferences, the euro exchange rate changed by 3% -5%
in a short time.

The softer tone of the statements will have a negative impact on the
euro. Conversely, a tough tone from ECB officials on central bank
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) will strengthen the euro.

###  **Friday, October 29**

###  **00:30 AUD Retail Sales Index**

Retail Sales Index is published monthly by the Australian Bureau of
Statistics and measures total retail sales. The index is often
considered an indicator of consumer confidence and reflects the health
of the retail sector in the near term. A rise in the index is usually
positive for the AUD; a decrease in the indicator will negatively affect
the AUD. The previous value of the index (in August) was -1.7% (after
declining by -2.7% in July and by -1.8% in June). If the data turns out
to be weaker than the previous value, the AUD may sharply decline in the
short term, if it's above the previous values, the AUD is likely to
strengthen. Outlook for September: + 0.2%.

###  **06:00 EUR Germany GDP for the 3rd quarter (preliminary release)**

GDP is considered the most important indicator of the overall health of
the economy. The growing trend in the GDP indicator is considered
positive for the national currency. The German economy is the locomotive
of the entire European economy. A high value of GDP is considered a
positive factor for the EUR, while a low one is considered negative.

The growth of the European and German economies slowed sharply in 2019,
and in 2020 the European economy has already entered a recession in many
ways. The risk of a coronavirus pandemic has been added to domestic
political risks after Brexit.

If the GDP data turn out to be weaker than the forecast, it will put
even more downward pressure on the euro. Better-than-expected data may
strengthen the euro in the short term. However, the risks for the euro
are directed towards its further weakening.

Forecast: German GDP grew by + 2.2% in the 3rd quarter (+ 2.4% in annual
[terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)).

###  **09:00 EUR Eurozone GDP for the 3rd quarter (first estimate).
Consumer Price Index. Core CPI (preliminary release)**

GDP is considered to be an indicator of the overall health of the
economy. The upward trend in GDP is considered positive for the EUR; a
poor result weakens the EUR.

Recently, macro data from the Eurozone have been indicating a gradual
recovery in the growth rate of the European economy after a sharp drop
in early 2020.

So, according to the forecast of economists, GDP growth in the Eurozone
is expected in the 3rd quarter of 2021 by + 1.9% (+ 3.5% in annual
[terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) after growth by + 2.2% (+ 14.3% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) in the 2nd
quarter and a decline of -0.3% (-1.3% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) in the 1st
quarter of 2021, by -0.7% (-4.9% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) in 4 Q3 2020, + 12.5%
​​growth (-4.3% YoY fall) in Q3, -11.8% Fall (-14.7% YoY) in 2 -3.6%
(-3.1% YoY) in Q1 2020.

If the data turn out to be weaker than the forecast, the euro may
decline. Better-than-forecast data may strengthen the euro in the short
term, although it is still far from the full recovery of the European
economy even to pre-crisis levels (quarterly growth within 0.2% - 0.4%).

###  **10:00 EUR Consumer price index. Core CPI (preliminary release)**

Consumer Price Index (CPI) is published by Eurostat and measures the
price change of a selected basket of goods and services over a given
period. The index is a key indicator for assessing inflation and changes
in purchasing habits. A positive result strengthens the EUR, a negative
one weakens it. At the end of 2020, the CPI index fell by -0.3%, which
indicates low inflationary pressures and even a slowdown in inflation.
Outlook for October 2021: + 3.7% (YoY) vs. + 3.4% in September, + 1.9%
in June, + 2.0% in May, + 1.3% in March, + 0.9% in January and February.
If the data turns out to be worse than the forecast, then the euro may
drop sharply in the short term. Data better than the forecast and / or
the previous value may strengthen the euro in the short term. The target
level of consumer inflation by the ECB is slightly below 2.0%.

Core Consumer Price Index (Core CPI) determines the change in prices of
a selected basket of goods and services for a given period and is a key
indicator for assessing inflation and changes in consumer preferences.
Food and energy have been excluded from this indicator to provide a more
accurate estimate. A high result strengthens the EUR, while a low result
weakens it. In September 2021, Core CPI rose by + 1.9%, + 0.9% in June,
+ 1.0% in May, + 0.7% in April (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) after more modest
values ​​of +0. 2% between September and December 2020. If the data for
October turn out to be worse than the previous value or forecast, this
may negatively affect the euro. If the data turn out to be better than
the forecast or the previous value, the euro is likely to respond with
an increase in quotations, but only in the short term. Core inflation in
the Eurozone remains low, which is a negative factor for the euro.
Forecast for October: + 1.9%.
