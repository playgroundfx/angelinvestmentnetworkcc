Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 12.11.2020Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I suggest entry signals
to trade each cryptocurrency.

The BTCUSD and ETHUSD market situations are similar. The markets have
recently completed corrective sub-waves as triangles. The bullish
impulses are currently developing. A detailed market description is
below.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

There continues developing the upward impulse wave C that is the part of
a larger zigzag. The sub-waves [1]-[2]-[3]-[4] have completed within
wave C. There is now forming the bullish wave [5] as a simple five-wave
impulse. The fourth wave of this impulse, correction (4), has finished
as a contracting triangle. The market should be rising in wave (5)
towards the level of 16700.00.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 15675.50, TP 16700.00

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

 ****

The XRPUSD market is forming the upward zigzag A-B-C, where the first
two legs have completed. Wave A is a five-wave impulse, corrective wave
B is a triple zigzag. Impulse wave C is still unfolding. There is now
forming the final wave [5], with four parts out of five completed
within. Therefore, the market should be rising in the final wave (5) to
a level of 0.272. At this level, the entire bullish correction (B) will
reach 50% Fibonacci of the (A) impulse.

### Trading plan for **[XRPUSD][2]** today:

Buy 0.255, TP 0.272

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

 ****

The ETHUSD market, like the BTCUSD, is rising in the impulse wave C. The
final leg of the C wave is currently unfolding, it is wave [5]. The
sideways corrective wave (4) has finished within impulse [5] as a
contracting triangle. The price is now rising in wave (5). Therefore,
the Ethereum price should be rising to a level of 507.00. One could
enter purchases in the current situation.

### Trading plan for  **[ETHUSD][3] **today:

Buy 458.29, TP 507.00
