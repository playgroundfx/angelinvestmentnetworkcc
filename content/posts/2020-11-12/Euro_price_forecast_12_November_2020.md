Euro and ‘fun isolation’. Forecast as of 12.11.2020Dmitri Demidenko

The [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) repeats. In late spring-early autumn, the [S&P 500][1]
pushes the EURUSD up. The same could occur in the rest of 2020. Let us
discuss the Forex outlook and make up a [EURUSD][2] trading plan.

##  ** **Monthly** **euro** **fundamental forecast****

I have often mentioned that the fourth quarter should be similar to the
second, although the disaster should be less dramatic. This is evident
from economic data, which suggests the current restrictions hit the
euro-area economy. However, the damage is far less than it was during
the previous lockdown. People continue going to work, manufacturing
operates, and the government restricts entertainment and retail trading.
The so-called ‘fun isolation’ suggests that vaccines' introduction will
allow the euro-area economy to recover soon. This fact lets me hope that
the [EURUSD][2] correction won’t be deep.

Of course, the ECB would like the euro to cost as little as possible,
which will support exports and accelerate inflation. In her recent
speech, Christine Lagarde highlighted the effectiveness of the Pandemic
Emergence Purchase Program (PEPP) and anti-crisis long-term refinancing
operation (LTRO). This was a clear signal that both of them will be
expanded in December. On the other hand, the ECB president did not say
anything about interest-rate changes. It is quite possible that by
increasing the scale of QE, the ECB will cause the same reaction in
[EURUSD][2] as the Bank of England did by its similar actions. Remember,
the pound rose in response to the BoE monetary easing in November.

But still, the primary growth driver for the EURUSD is not the liquidity
trap suggesting lower efficiency of the stimulating measures as their
volumes increase and inadequate response of the regional currency. That
is the rally of the US stock indexes, which supports the euro. Yes, the
[S&P 500][1] growth on November 9 unexpectedly supported the dollar. But
this situation resulted from the realization of the investment idea of
Biden’s victory in the US presidential election. The correlation between
the US stock market and the [EURUSD][2] should soon restore, which could
encourage the euro bulls to go ahead.

The record stimuli as the response to the recession have poured a huge
amount of money into the financial system. Ahead of the elections,
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s preferred to hold cash because of uncertainty. Now, that money
goes back into the market. Amid positive [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) about vaccines, the [S&P
500][1] rallies thanks to traditional industries, including industry and
banking. As soon as there are talks about a long vaccine introduction
process, the stock market is still rising. This time thanks to the tech
stocks.

### Monthly [EURUSD][2] trading plan

The current situation looks like that of the second quarter when the US
and the euro-area economies slid down into recession, and the [S&P
500][1] was growing. Investors expected the recession to end soon, and
the GDP recovery to be V-shaped. The same is now. It will take a long
time to introduce the COVID-19 vaccine after it has been approved.
However, the stock indexes are rallying up, suggesting purchases of the
[EURUSD][2] if the price closes above 1.18 and 1.1845. Otherwise, the US
stock market correction will send the euro down to $1.172 and $1.167.
