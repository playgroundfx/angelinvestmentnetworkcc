Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 30.09.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

Yesterday, the short-term euro downtrend continued.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

On Thursday morning, the short-term oil uptrend continues. Yesterday,
the traders tested the key support of the trend, Intermediary Zone 73.95
- 73.69, but unsuccessfully. Today expect a pattern to buy oil with the
target at level 76.41.

An alternative scenario suggests a breakout of the Intermediary Zone and
price consolidation below. In this case, the short-term trend will
reverse down, so start selling oil in the lower Target Zone 71.40 -
70.89.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

Buy according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 73.95 - 73.69.
TakeProfit: 76.41. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

Yesterday, gold sellers reached the Gold Zone 1725 - 1723. For a further
fall, traders need to break out the GZ and consolidate the price below.
In this case, the next target will be Target Zone 2 1704 - 1700.

Today, as part of the correction, the Additional Zone 1733 - 1731, which
serves as a strong resistance, was tested. Look for sales in the AZ
according to the take-profit pattern at the yesterday's low.

To enter purchases, traders need to break out the Additional Zone. This
will allow considering a long trade with a target in the Intermediary
Zone 1744 - 1742.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

Sell according to the pattern in Additional Zone 1733 - 1731.
TakeProfit: 1723. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

Yesterday, the short-term euro downtrend continued. As a result, the
Gold Zone 1.1645 - 1.1636 was reached and broken out. The next target
for sales is Target Zone 2 1.1557 - 1.1539.

Taking into account the general overbought of the US dollar, today
expect a euro correction and a test of the nearest resistance level
which is the Additional Zone 1.1638 - 1.1633. After the AZ test, look at
the traders' reaction. If a sell pattern is formed, then sell the euro
with a target at yesterday's low.

If the Additional Zone is broken out by a strong upward impulse, then
consider purchases up to the Intermediary Zone 1.1686 - 1.1677. Level
1.1687 serves as the border of the short-term downtrend.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

Sell according to the pattern in Additional Zone 1.1638 - 1.1633.
TakeProfit: 1.1592. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.
