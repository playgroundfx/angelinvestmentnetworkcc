Dollar closes the Powell gap. Forecast as of 30.09.2021Dmitri Demidenko

The US economy is strong, and its European counterpart has moved off the
edge of the abyss but has not yet gone out of the forest. In such
conditions, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s have the right to expect an increase in the
Federal Funds rate and the ECB's preservation of ultra-soft monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). How will this affect [EUR/USD][1]? Let's discuss it and make up
a trading plan.

## Monthly US dollar fundamental forecast

Of the two evils, everyone usually chooses the least. The distortion of
the bond market seemed to the Fed to be far less evil than the
recession, so the central bank turned on the printing press at full
capacity in March 2020. As a result, the economy was saved, but
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s could no longer get valuable information about its state by
looking at the debt market. Treasury yields remained low for a very long
time, and the Powell gap only widened as global GDP recovered. In
autumn, it started contracting. That pushed the [EUR/USD][1] pair to a
14-month minimum.

Usually, bonds are sold when [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s' confidence in the bright future
of the economy grows and/or fears about accelerating inflation increase.
Until recently, the Fed, with the help of a cheap money [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/),
suppressed both faith and fears. However, in September, the central
bank's optimism about the outlook for the US economy and its signal
about the cessation of QE in November freed Treasury yields from the
dungeon. The rates of the American debt market are clearly understated
in comparison with the global business activity, and it is time for
their difference, which is commonly called the Powell gap, to decrease.

### Treasury yields and global business activity dynamics

Due to yet another outbreak of COVID-19, problems with supply chains and
with hiring activity, the Purchasing Managers' Indexes have been going
down lately. However, most of the indicators are above 50, a mark
indicating expansion, and experts are optimistic about the outlook for
the US GDP. The Fed raised its forecast for economic growth in 2022 from
3.3% to 3.8%, and Decision Economics expects it to be 4.2% in the third,
6.5% in the fourth and 5.1% in the first quarter. The economy is like a
compressed spring that COVID-19 prevents from straightening, but sooner
or later it will happen.

In 2022, the Fed will have to deal with a very difficult task: how not
to resort to aggressive monetary restrictions in the face of a booming
labour market recovery and high inflation? Jerome Powell believes supply
chain problems will continue into the next year, allowing PCE to remain
at higher levels. The Fed chairman argues that the surge in prices is
the result of limited supply amid very strong demand. This is related to
economic recovery, and this process has a beginning, a middle and an
end.

The central bank does not expect a new inflationary regime to emerge but
admits that supply chain problems are deeper than anticipated. If they
persist and lead to a further rise in inflationary expectations, the Fed
will be forced to raise rates. The ECB is not going to do this at least
until 2024. According to Christine Lagarde, the eurozone economy has
stepped away from the edge of the abyss but has not yet to get out of
the forest.

### Monthly [EUR/USD][2] trading plan

Divergence in monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) leads to the widening of the yield
differential for the US and the European bonds and contributes to the
decline of [EUR/USD][1]. The pair has reached its [target at 1.1615][3]
and is heading to [1.156][4]. Continue to adhere to the strategy of
shorting the pair on pullbacks.
