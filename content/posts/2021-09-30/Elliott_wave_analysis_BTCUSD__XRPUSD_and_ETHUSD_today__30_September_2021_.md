Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 30.09.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

All three cryptocurrency pairs are expecting a downward price movement
in the near future.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

The development of the BTCUSD market implies a downward movement within
a new bearish wave that is unfolding in the form of an impulse. On the
hourly timeframe, the structure of sub-wave 1 in the form of an impulse,
and the structure of corrective wave 2 in the form of a zigzag
[A]-[B]-[C] can be seen. Shortly, the price is expected to decline
within impulse 3 below the level of 39500.00. One could enter sell
trades in the current situation.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Sell 43640.00, TP 39500.00

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

The XRPUSD market suggests the development of a new downward impulse
wave, which is part of a larger corrective wave. After the completion of
sub-waves 1 and 2, the market continued to decline within the third
wave, which is unfolding as an impulse. It is assumed that the
development of the corrective subwave [2] in the form of a zigzag
(A)-(B)-(C) has been recently completed. In the near future, a decline
is expected within the bearish wave [3] below the level of 0.805. One
could enter sell trades in the current situation.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] **** today:

Sell 0.953, TP 0.805

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

The ETHUSD, like other major cryptocurrencies, is developing a new
downward wave in the form of an impulse. Currently, the market is
developing the initial part of the third wave, in which the sub-waves
[1] and [2] are completed. In the near future, the market is expected to
fall within impulse [3] below the level of 2643.00. In the current
situation, it is profitable to enter short trades.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Sell 3024.17, TP 2643.00
