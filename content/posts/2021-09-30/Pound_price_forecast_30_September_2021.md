Pound: decline is near. Forecast as of 30.09.2021Dmitri Demidenko

In the middle of summer, the [GBPUSD][1] bulls were ambitious about
reaching level 1.45, but at the end of September they pray that the pair
would not fall to level 1.3. What is the reason for the pound's
collapse? Let us discuss the market outlook and make up a trading plan.

## Weekly pound fundamental forecast

The marketplace is where dreams come true and hopes are shattered. The
most serious moves tend to happen when [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s get rid of their
illusions by selling an asset that they previously bought with renewed
vigor. On the eve of the September meeting of the Bank of England, hedge
funds expecting a hawkish surprise have increased pound longs at the
fastest pace in two years. Nevertheless, the understanding that the BoE
is not able to solve all the problems of the UK economy made the
[GBPUSD][1] bulls retreat. As a result, the pair fell to the December
bottom, having lost all gains since the beginning of the year.

### Dynamics of pound longs

Recently, the pound encouraged by rapid vaccinations, the booming UK
economy after its opening and hopes of a higher interest rate, was among
the G10 leaders. In early June, the GBPUSD price reached its highest
level in more than three years. However, first, the Fed's hawkish shift,
and then the problems of the UK economy, knocked out the bulls. In
September, the pair sank by more than 2%, marking the worst 2-day
dynamics in the last 12 months. The volatility of the sterling is the
highest among the G10, for which it is often jokingly called the Great
British Peso, comparing it with the currency of a developing country. At
the same time, the collapse of US stock indices contributes to the
[GBPUSD][1] fall.

Despite the fact that all MPC members are ready to vote for a rate hike
this year to combat high inflation, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are well aware of how
difficult the task is facing the central bank. The BoE head notes that
the regulator is not able to solve problems with supply chains and warns
that the recovery of the UK economy to pre-pandemic levels is likely to
occur as early as 2022, several months later than originally planned.

The United Kingdom, as well as the whole of Europe, is threatened with
an energy crisis. However, in the UK, the problem is more acute due to
labor shortages associated with Brexit and is fraught with a serious GDP
slowdown. At the same time, the rise in gas prices to record peaks and
oil prices to 3-year highs exacerbate the risks of excessive inflation.
According to Credit Agricole the best strategy for hedging stagflation
the UK is facing, is to sell [GBPUSD][1].

### Weekly [GBPUSD][1] trading plan

The money markets may be 100% confident that BoE will raise the interest
rate in February and 60% that it will happen in December, but in
reality, the central bank may step back from its intentions so as not to
slow down the economy. As a result, some [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s rushed to sell the
pound. We are reaping the benefits of successful [GBPUSD][1] sales when
the price rebounds from [resistances at 1.3725 and 1.3675][2]. The
inability of the pair to overcome the support at 1.3415 is a reason to
fix part of profit. On the contrary, a successful breakout will give
reason to add up to short trades.
