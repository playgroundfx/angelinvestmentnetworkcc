Aussie goes against the wind. Forecast as of 05.10.2020Dmitri Demidenko

Uncertainty is not the [best time](https://www.fixpro.org/post/forex-best-time-to-trade/) for risky assets. However, it should
ease sooner or later, which will help risky currencies gain back. We
shall see if the AUD will strengthen and make an [AUDUSD][1] trading
plan.

##  **Monthly Australian dollar fundamental analysis**

Hope for the best but do the rest. Although the major drivers of the
[AUDUSD][1] 30% rally up from the March low have been the rapid recovery
of China’s economy and the increase in the global risk appetite, the
Australian dollar has domestic drivers as well. Australia efficiently
manages the pandemic, and the government is willing to expand the fiscal
stimulus. Australia’s Treasurer Josh Frydenberg is willing to provide
money until the labor market returns to the full employment state. It is
about the unemployment rate of 5%. The current unemployment rate is
6.8%, and it may grow to 8%-10%. It will hardly drop back to 5% before
2022.

Investors expect the Treasury to boost the fiscal stimulus. As a result,
the net debt burden will increase to AU$712 billion or to 38% of the
GDP. At the same time, the national debt ceiling will be increased above
AU$1.1 trillion, and the income tax hike, planned for 2022, will be
delayed. In the USA, the national debt exceeds 100% of GDP, in the euro-
area, it is close to 100%, the Japanese government debt is more than
200%. Canberra can afford additional stimulus. Besides, the expansion of
government bonds issue will support the capital inflow in Australia and
strengthen the Aussie. Australia’s government bond rates are the highest
among the countries issuing the G10 currencies.

Carry trades and high investment rating of Australia’s securities
support and will support the [AUDUSD][1] bulls amid the high risk
appetite and low volatility. That is the reason for the AUD correlation
with the US stock indices. The turmoil in the [S&P 500][2] market ahead
of the US presidential election will suggest the AUDUSD consolidation.

In addition to the size of the additional fiscal stimulus, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are
focused on the RBA's willingness to expand the volume of monetary
support. In September, the RBA officials discussed such measures as the
interest-rate cut down to 0.1%, purchasing bonds with longer maturities
than currently under QE, negative borrowing costs, and even FX
interventions. The latter two [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) are aggressive, and the regulator
will hardly resort to such measures. But it is likely to cut the
interest rate by 12 basis points. The derivatives market suggests it
will happen already this year.

### Monthly [AUDUSD][1] trading plan

Expectations of monetary expansion is a bearish factor for the AUD.
However, I don’t think the RBA will do it in October. It is likely to
leave the door open for the interest rate cut in the future and set the
Aussie bulls back using verbal interventions. The RBA will hardly turn
the uptrend down, so, its dovish stance will give a chance to buy the
pair of the price fall. Following ht consolidation in the range of
0.695-0.735, the [AUDUSD][1] is likely to continue its rally up to 0.76
and 0.79.
