Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 05.10.2020Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I suggest entry signals
to trade each cryptocurrency.

All cryptocurrency pairs analyzed in the article are forming the
corrective sub-waves. The Bitcoin price is to be rising in the impulse
wave C to a level of 11315, as the impulse is half-complete as of now.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

The BTCUSD market is forming the upward linking wave [X] as a double
zigzag (W)-(X)-(Y). The sub-waves (W) and (X) have completed, the (Y)
wave is yet unfolding, it is about to end soon. The impulse wave A and
the B correction have completed. The price should be rising in the
impulse wave C towards a level of 11315. One could enter long positions
with a target to take profit at the end of the entire linking wave [X].

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 10669.87, TP 11315.00

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

The XRPUSD market is forming the simple down zigzag A-B-C. The impulse
wave composed of five sub-waves [1]-[2]-[3]-[4]-[5] has completed. There
is now developing the bullish correction B as a zigzag [a]-[b]-[c].
After the down correction [b] finished, the price has started rising in
the final impulse [c]. The [c] impulse should conclude the pattern at a
level of around 0.254.

### Trading plan for **[XRPUSD][2]** today:

Buy 0.248, TP 0.254

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

The ETHUSD market is forming a corrective wave [2] that is an element of
the new downtrend unfolding as an impulse. Correction [2] is likely to
complete as a standard zigzag (a)-(b)-(c). The market is now forming the
final leg of this zigzag, the (c) impulse. Therefore, the price should
be rising in the indicated impulse to a level of 370.00. Next, the price
could turn down and start declining.

### Trading plan  **[ETHUSD][3] **today:

Buy 350.94, TP 370.00
