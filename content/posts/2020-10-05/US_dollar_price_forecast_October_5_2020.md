Dollar enjoys uncertainty. Forecast as of 05.10.2020Dmitri Demidenko

Investors discuss the issues associated with the health of the US
president. The uncertainty is rising, which strengthens the greenback.
Will the dollar rally last long? I will try to answer and offer a
[EURUSD][1] trading plan.

### Monthly US dollar fundamental forecast

The US jobs report for September is weak. But does it matter if Donald
Trump is infected with COVID-19? The illness of the US president
increases uncertainty. What is the president's true state of health?
Will he really be discharged already on October 5? Or the fact that he
was given oxygen and medication for seriously ill patients suggests the
US president is really sick? Is the disease a political trick? When
Boris Johnson was infected with the coronavirus, his approval rating
increased amid the general sympathy. Finally, could Trump have infected
Joe Biden during the debate?

The disease of the US president and the associated surge of uncertainty
send the US stock indexes down. If Trump misses the presidential
campaign, the chance of the Democrats’ victory in the election will
rise. Joe Biden’s promise to raise the taxes presses down the US stock
market. Investors are confident in [S&P 500][2] the crash following the
victory of the Democratic candidate. In my opinion, this bet could be
wrong. Increased infrastructure spending and a better chance of
congressional approval of additional aid packages will benefit the
economy and the stock indices. Trump is going to continue trade wars,
which often pressed the US equities down in 2018-2019.

I believe the [S&P 500][2] won’t crash anyway. As a result, the demand
for the US dollar should soon weaken. The greenback benefits from the
uncertainty now. Once the turmoil eases, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s will sell off the
dollar. The USD long-term outlook is still bearish. In the 1970s and
1980s, the USD index fell by 33% in real [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/), in 2002-2011 - by
another 28%. During those periods, the current account deficit was -2.5%
of GDP, compared to the current value of -3.5% of GDP. Considering a
sharp decline in the net national saving rate, the US will have to use
foreign loans to maintain economic growth, which should increase the US
foreign trade deficit and weaken the US dollar.

### Dynamics of US current account, % of GDP

 _Source_ _: Financial Times_

According to the OECD forecasts, the global economy will expand by 5% in
2021, following a 4.5% contraction in 2020. If the COVID-19 vaccines'
introduction goes faster than planned, the global growth rate could
increase to 7%. The higher is the global GDP, the stronger is the risk
appetite, which encourages the [EURUSD][1] bulls.

Yes, the US dollar will remain strong as a safe haven amid several
factors in the short run. They are the uncertainty around the US
presidential election, the first since 2016 deflation in the euro area
for two consecutive months, which raises the chance of the European QE
expansion, and the second pandemic wave. But what will be next, in a few
months?

###  **Monthly** **[EURUSD][1] trading plan**

I believe you should build your Forex strategy according to your trading
style. If you are a long-term [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/), willing to hold positions for a
long time, you should add up to the longs when the [EURUSD][1] goes down
below 1.17. If you are a short-term trader, it makes sense to sell now.
