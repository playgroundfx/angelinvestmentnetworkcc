Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 23.04.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

Bitcoin and Ripple must have completed linking waves, so there should be
unfolding motive waves. Ripple has just started developing a bullish
impulse.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

In the most recent chart section, there is developing a descending
double zigzag W-X-Y. Wave W completed as a double zigzag, and the
triangle linking wave X, composed of the sub-waves [A]-[B]-[C]-[D]-[E],
also completed. There must be forming the bearish motive wave Y, which
could complete as a simple zigzag [A]-[B]-[C]. Impulse [A] must have
ended, so the price should be following the upward corrective wave [B].
Next, the market will resume declining in the [C] impulse to a level of
44250.00. At this level, wave Y will be 76.4% of wave W.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Sell 50537.50, TP 44250.00

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

After the impulse up wave [1] completed, there started the corrective
down wave [2]. Correction [2] must have finished as a double zigzag
(W)-(X)-(Y). Wave (W) is a triple zigzag, wave (X) is a simple zigzag,
and wave (Y) is a double zigzag. Therefore, over the next few days,
there should be developing the initial part of the impulse wave [3]. The
price could soon rise above level 1.462, which is the high made by wave
X.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] today:

Buy 0.954, TP 1.462

## Elliott wave Ethereum analysis

In the recent section of the ETHUSD price chart, there is developing the
descending double zigzag (W)-(X)-(Y). The market must have finished the
upward linking wave (X) as a double zigzag W-X-Y, where the Y wave is a
triple zigzag. There is now unfolding the bearish wave (Y), which could
end as a simple zigzag A-B-C. The A impulse must have finished, so there
should be unfolding a short correction B. When the B correction
finishes, the market will resume declining in the C impulse. The price
could go down to a level of 2033.00, where waves (W) and (Y) will be
equal.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Sell 2274.53, TP 2033.00
