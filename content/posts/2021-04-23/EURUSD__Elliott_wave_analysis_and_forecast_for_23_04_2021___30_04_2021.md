EURUSD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 23.04.2021 –
30.04.2021Alex Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions above the level of 1.1846
with a target of 1.2104 – 1.2238 once the correction formed.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
1.1846 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of 1.1600
– 1.1489.

 **Analysis:** Daily time frame: presumably, the first wave of larger
degree 1 of (3) has formed, and a downside correction is forming as wave
2 of (3). Apparently, wave a of 2 has formed and ascending wave b of 2
is developing on the H4 time frame. Supposedly, wave of smaller degree
(a) of b formed on the H1 time frame. If this assumption is correct, the
pair may be expected to continue growing to the levels of 1.2104 –
1.2238 once correction (b) of b formed. The level of 1.1846 is critical
in this scenario. Its breakout will allow the pair to continue falling
to the levels of 1.1600 – 1.1489.
