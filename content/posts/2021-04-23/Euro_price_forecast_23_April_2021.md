Euro lands on solid ground. Forecast as of 23.04.2021Dmitri Demidenko

Unlike the euro-area economy, which has not yet recovered after the
pandemic, the euro seems to have stabilized. Markets are rising on the
expectations, which affects the [EURUSD][1]. Let us discuss the Forex
outlook and make up a trading plan.

## Weekly euro fundamental forecast

Christine Lagarde’s willingness to keep interest rates and coronavirus
stimulus unchanged made the [EURUSD][1] bulls step back but didn’t
discourage them from buying the euro. The price drop to the bottom of
figure 20 is immediately bought out, which signals a dramatic change in
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) sentiment compared to March. Although ECB insists that the
euro-area economy needs support, its rebound will make the central bank
correct monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).

According to Lagarde, the euro-area economy still has a long way to go
before it crosses the bridge of the pandemic and lands on solid ground
so that the central bank could start phasing out asset purchases under
the PEPP. Recently, the weekly pace of asset purchases has increased
from €14 billion to €17 billion. Before the Governing Council’s meeting,
some analysts expected the ECB hawks to call for phasing out the bond
purchase volumes. Lagarde says this matter is premature to talk about.

The ECB president made two more attempts to discourage the [EURUSD][1]
bulls. She noted that the ECB closely followed the euro exchange rate
and stressed the factors of divergence in monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) and economic
growth. “But if you look where the Fed is and where we are. And when you
look at expectations in the U.S. and expectations in the euro area. We
are not on the same page”, said Lagarde. This phrase can be taken as a
hint that the European Central Bank will begin to phase out stimulus
later than the Federal Reserve since the euro-area economy lags behind
the US one. JP Morgan estimates that the European GDP will grow by 6% in
the second quarter, after a 1% drop in the first. For the US, the growth
expectations for the same periods are + 10% and + 5%.

Of course, Christine Lagarde did her best to discourage the [EURUSD][1]
bulls. Moreover, the euro sellers should have been supported by the
fears of raising the tax rate for wealthy Americans from 20% to 39.6%,
which pressed down the US stock indexes. However, the euro remains
stable, suggesting the trend to be up. Euro buyers just need a new
driver, and one could come up in the next few hours. I mean the release
of the euro-area PMI data. The preliminary PMI estimates for April are
weaker than the actual data for March, but the acceleration of the
vaccine rollouts in the EU could add optimism to both manufacturers and
service providers.

### Weekly [EURUSD][1] trading plan

I believe the [EURUSD][1] bears will hardly take control over the market
unless the US Treasury yields resume growing. Moreover, the US bond
yields should remain under pressure as [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s expect Jerome Powell to
express at the FOMC April meeting the same ideas as Christine Lagarde
did. Powell should suggest that it is preliminary to talk about phasing
out the QE. If so, it is still relevant to buy the euro on the price
rebound from the support levels of $1.199-$1.2 and $1.1935-$1.194. It is
also relevant to enter longs when the price breaks through recent highs.
The rally could start if the report on the euro-area PMI is strong.
