ECB's attempts to let the Fed take the lead look awkward

## While the Fed is dragging its feet, other regulators may get into a
mess

When I was a child, my parents would put me on a chair and ask me to
recite a poem. If they liked the poem, they would give me sweets. If
they didn't, they would knock the chair away. Christine Lagarde knew
well what insufficiently "dovish" rhetoric could do to the euro and
European bond yields. So, she did all she could to frighten the
[EURUSD][1] bulls with her speech at the ECB's meeting in April. Lagarde
was extremely eloquent when she compared pandemic life with a bridge and
post-pandemic life with solid ground, and wondered where the Fed's and
the ECB's monetary policies were on that page. However, she wasn't
eloquent enough to make euro buyers start retreating.

Just as humanity fits into two categories - animal rights activists and
the bitten ones - Central banks subdivide into the old school, which
tighten monetary policies not to overheat an economy, and innovators.
When deciding to phase out monetary stimuli, most of them are guided by
2% full employment and inflation targets, but St. Louis Fed President
James Bullard has got one more target to reach. He believes that the US
vaccination level must rise to 75% for US QE to be phased out. Sixty-
five percent of the US population have had the first dose so far, and
almost 27% got both doses. It's the last value that should be
considered, most probably. Israel is taking the lead, with 55% of its
population fully vaccinated.

James Bullard's opinion doesn't reflect the Fed's position. However, the
US central bank's position is so controversial that I can't say for sure
on which page its monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) is. Christine Lagarde suggests that
the ECB won't change its monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) before the Fed does, but it's a
mere suggestion. The world is so dependent on the US dollar that Jerome
Powell and his colleagues would be beaten hard if they started to
normalize the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). As they say, when you order soap on the
internet, get ready to see rope and chair ads.

Unlike the Fed, the Bank of Canada doesn't give a damn. It was as brief
as possible at April's meeting:

> \- I've got some [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/). Some [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) is good, and some [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) is even worse.
We'll phase out our QE program and raise the overnight rate earlier than
the Fed does. Around the end of 2022.

The loonie has already registered the best [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) dynamics in the past
ten months. Did Ottawa need that?

The story of the Canadian dollar and childhood memories of reciting
poems on a chair did bother Mme Lagarde. So, she couldn't afford to lose
and seemed to destroy the markets, saying that "they did not discuss any
phasing out of PEPP because it is simply premature." I would not be
surprised if a Bloomberg insider said tomorrow there had already been
some talks about phasing out bond purchases. What's more, Jerome Powell
could say the same thing, and that would be a different story. A story
about a weak dollar.
