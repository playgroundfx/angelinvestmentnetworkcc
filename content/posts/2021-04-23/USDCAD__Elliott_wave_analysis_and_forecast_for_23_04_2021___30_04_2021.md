USDCAD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 23.04.2021 –
30.04.2021Alex Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 1.2652 with a target of 1.2300 – 1.2200.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
1.2652 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 1.2989 –
1.3308.

 **Analysis:** wave (С) of 4 of larger degree continues developing on
the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame, with the first wave 1 of (C) forming inside. The
fifth wave v of 1 is forming on the H4 time frame, with wave (v) of v of
smaller degree developing inside. On the H1 time frame, the third wave
iii of (v) appears to have formed, a local correction is completed as
wave iv of (v), and wave v of (v) started forming. If the presumption is
correct, the pair will continue to drop to the levels of 1.2300 –
1.2200. The level of 1.2652 is critical in this scenario, as the
breakout will enable the pair to continue rising to the levels of 1.2989
– 1.3308.
