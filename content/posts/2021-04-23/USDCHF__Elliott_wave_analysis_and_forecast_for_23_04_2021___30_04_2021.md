USDCHF: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 23.04.2021 –
30.04.2021Alex Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions above the level of 0.9127
with a target of 0.9505 – 0.9590.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
0.9127 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of 0.9073
– 0.8873.

 **Analysis:** Presumably, the descending first wave of larger degree
(1) of 5 finished developing on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame, with wave 5 of (1)
formed inside. An ascending correction started developing as wave (2) on
the H4 time frame, with wave A of (2) forming inside. The third wave of
smaller degree iii of А appears to have formed on the H1 time frame, and
a local correction developed as wave iv of A, supposedly. If this
assumption is correct, the pair will continue rising to 0.9505 – 0.9590
in wave v of A. The level of 0.9127 is critical in this scenario. Its
breakout will allow the pair to continue falling to the levels of 0.9073
– 0.8873.
