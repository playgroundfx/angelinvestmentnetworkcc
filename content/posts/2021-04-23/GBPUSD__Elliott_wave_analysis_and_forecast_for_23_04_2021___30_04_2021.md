GBPUSD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 23.04.2021 –
30.04.2021Alex Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 1.4237 with a target of 1.3572 – 1.3158 once the correction is
completed.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
1.4237 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 1.4450 –
1.4700.

 **Analysis:** presumably, the first wave of larger degree (1) finished
developing on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame, with wave 5 of (1) formed inside. A
descending correction started developing as wave (2) on the H4 time
frame, with wave A of (2) formed inside. Apparently, wave B of (2) is
developing on the H1 time frame, with wave a of B formed inside. If this
assumption is correct, the pair will continue to fall to 1.3572 – 1.3158
after correction B of (2) is completed. The level of 1.4237 is critical
in this scenario, as the breakout will enable the pair to continue
rising to the levels of 1.4450 – 1.4700.
