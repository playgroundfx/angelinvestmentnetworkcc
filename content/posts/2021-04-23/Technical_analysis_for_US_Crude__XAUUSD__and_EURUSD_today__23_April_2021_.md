Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 23.04.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

The short-term euro uptrend continues. Traders are trying to break out
the Target Zone 1.2040 - 1.2024.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

At the moment, oil is trading in a short-term downtrend with the target
at level 60.75. A breakout of level 60.75 will mean a further price fall
to the Target Zone 59.25 - 58.74.

As part of the oil correction, the price reached Additional Zone 62.00 -
61.87. The trend key resistance of 62.22 is just above the zone.
Therefore, it is profitable to enter oil sales in the zone of 62.22 -
61.87.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

Sell from the zone of 62.22 - 61.87. TakeProfit: 60.75, Target Zone
59.25 - 58.74. StopLoss: 63.05.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

Since yesterday, the gold has been correcting in the short-term uptrend.
As part of the correction, the Additional Zone 1785 - 1784 was broken
out. The next target of the price fall is the Intermediary Zone 1772 -
1770.

Today at the Asian trading session, the price entered the zone of good
sell prices 1791 - 1784. It is profitable to look for a short trade with
the first target at level 1780 and with the second in the Intermediary
Zone.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

Sell from the zone of 1791 - 1784. TakeProfit: 1780, Intermediary Zone
1772 - 1770. StopLoss: 1794.3.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

The short-term euro uptrend continues. Traders are trying to break out
the Target Zone 1.2040 - 1.2024. If successful, the next target will be
Gold Zone 1.2112 - 1.2104.

Today, look for euro purchases after breaking out level 1.2042. An
additional factor in favor of entering purchases will be the breakout of
the resistance at 1.2063.

An alternative scenario involves holding the Additional Zone 1.2042 -
1.2037 and a decline of prices to the Intermediary Zone 1.1992 - 1.1983.
The pattern around the resistances will allow opening a short euro
trade.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

  1. Sell according to the pattern in Additional Zone 1.2042 - 1.2037. TakeProfit: Intermediary Zone 1.1992 - 1.1983. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. Buy when level 1.2042 is broken out. TakeProfit: Gold Zone 1.2112 - 1.2104. StopLoss: 1.2030.
