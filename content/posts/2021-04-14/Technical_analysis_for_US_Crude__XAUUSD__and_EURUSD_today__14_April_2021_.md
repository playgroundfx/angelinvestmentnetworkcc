Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 14.04.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

The trade recommendation to buy the euro has worked out well.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

Oil traders are breaking out the key resistance of the short-term
downtrend 60.45 - 60.20. Closing the price at the US trading session
above the zone will confirm the trend reversal and set a buy target in
the upper Target Zone 63.26 - 62.75.

A price return below level 59.60 will indicate the formation of a "false
breakout" sell pattern, within which it will be possible to enter oil
sales with a target at 57.74.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

The key support of the short-term gold uptrend 1733 - 1731 was held.
Resistance level 1735 was broken out. The price reached the first buy
target - the level of 1745.

Further growth will be possible after the price consolidates above the
level of 1745. The target will be the zone of 1757 - 1755.

Holding level 1745 will allow the bears to regain control of the
situation and lower the price to the zone around level 1724.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

  1. Hold up a part of purchases entered according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 1733 - 1731. TakeProfit: Zone 1757 - 1755. StopLoss: at the breakeven.

  2. Aggressive: Sell according to the pattern in the level of 1745. TakeProfit: 1724. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

The trade recommendation to buy the euro has worked out well. As a
result, the target was reached during one trading day. Now, wait for the
breakout of the Gold Zone 1.1952 - 1.1944. Consolidation of the price
above the zone will set the next buying target - Target Zone 2 1.2040 -
1.2024.

Until the price consolidates above the Gold Zone, enter purchases on
corrections with short targets around today's high. Look for purchases
at strong supports: Additional Zone 1.1929 - 1.1925 and Intermediary
Zone 1.1889 - 1.1881. The trend border is at level 1.1885.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

  1. Buy according to the pattern in Additional Zone 1.1929 - 1.1925. TakeProfit: 1.1966. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. Buy according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 1.1889 - 1.1881. TakeProfit: 1.1966. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.
