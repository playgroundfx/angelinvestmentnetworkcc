Dollar believes the Fed. Forecast as of 14.04.2021Dmitri Demidenko

In March, the market believed that the US inflation surge would make the
Fed take active steps. In April, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s have changed their viewpoint.
The Fed will remain passive even if the СPI is up to 3.5%. Where will
the euro go? Let us discuss the Forex outlook and make up a [EURUSD][1]
trading plan.

## Monthly US dollar fundamental forecast

The world is not as it is, but as we imagine it. The financial markets’
reaction to the release of US inflation data for March convinces that
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s have finally believed the Fed's mantra of temporary inflation
growth. Typically, a CPI boost encourages [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s to sell the US
Treasury bonds, leading to higher yields. This time, the Treasury yields
fell, pressing down the US dollar as well.

It is difficult to spend money on car fuel if you stay at home all the
time. The low base last year led to a sharp jump in petrol prices by
9.1%, which accounted for more than half of the 2.6% rise in consumer
prices in March. The indicator performed the best growth for almost nine
years. In the coming months, it should continue rising to 3% by June.
Oxford Economics even believes that CPI will soar to 3.5%, but this will
not trigger an inflationary spiral. Yes, the low 2020 base, significant
deferred demand, and supply disruptions will surely drive consumer
prices up, but the Fed believes the rise will be temporary. And the
market trusts the central bank. Moreover, Wall Street Journal experts
suggest the US inflation should slow down to 2.6% by December.

The Federal Reserve passed the resistance test given by the Treasuries
sellers in March. The end of the rally in Treasury yields has deprived
the US dollar of its main advantage, the expectations of earlier
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) tightening than the central bank says. If so, even
despite the US economy’s strength, the [EURUSD][1] could resume the
uptrend and go to the level of 1.25 already in 2021. The euro-area
economy is supported not only by the USA with its potential 6.5% GDP
growth but also by China, which outperformed the US last year in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)
of trade in goods with the EU.

In this regard, it is not surprising that the more than 38% jump in
China's imports in March, together with the US Treasury's intention not
to label China as a currency manipulator, strengthened not only the yuan
but also the euro.

Rely on others, but do not make a mistake yourself. Google's mobility
data show an increase in hypermarket visits across Europe. And this is
amid the stricter lockdowns. This fact, in addition to the PMI increase,
the IFO German business climate improvement, and ZEW positive [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)
sentiment, as well as the vaccination acceleration in the euro area,
encouraged the [EURUSD][1] bulls to go ahead.

### Monthly [EURUSD][1] trading plan

As I wrote, the Forex market situation has radically changed in April
compared to March. In March, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s bet on the earlier federal funds
rate hike than the FOMC officials suggested. In April, the markets
abandoned this idea. Besides, the euro-area economic performance
improves, encouraging [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s to buy the [EURUSD][1]. [As
expected][2], the breakout of the resistance at 1.193 lets us expect the
rally continuation to 1.2, and next, to 1.204 and 1.208. It is relevant
to buy the pair on the price fall.
