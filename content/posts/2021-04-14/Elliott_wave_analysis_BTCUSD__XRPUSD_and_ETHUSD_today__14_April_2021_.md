Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 14.04.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

Bitcoin and Ethereum may have finished rising, and the prices should
soon start declining. The Ripple price could rise a little more.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

The BTCUSD price has risen a little higher than expected. The market
must have finished forming a zigzag-shaped wave [3], composed of the
sub-waves (A)-(B)-(C). In the near future, the price should be declining
in the fourth wave of an ending diagonal. Wave [4] could end at a level
of 57060.00, which is at the support line. Next, the price should resume
growing in the final wave [5]. In the current situation, one could enter
sell trades.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Sell 64391.50, TP 57060.00

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

The most recent section of the XRPUSD price chart displays the price
growth in the upward impulse, composed of five sub-waves
(1)-(2)-(3)-(4)-(5). There have completed the first two sub-waves so
far. There is now forming the upward impulse wave (3), namely, its final
fifth wave. The Ripple price could continue rising to a level of 2.101.
Next, the market should turn down and start declining in the corrective
wave (4). One could enter long positions with a target at the above-
mentioned level.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] today:

Buy 1.922, TP 2.1010

* * *

## Elliott wave Ethereum analysis

The ETHUSD, like the BTCUSD, must have started forming a new down wave.
The market is likely to have finished the bullish impulse C, so the
price should be following a new bearish trend over the next few days.
The Ethereum price should be falling to a level of 1540.00, marked by
corrective sub-wave (4). It is not clear what pattern is currently
unfolding, so, we shall continue monitoring the price chart.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Sell 2373.53, TP 1540.00
