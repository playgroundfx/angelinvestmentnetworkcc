Pound is caught in the crossfire. Forecast as of 23.09.2021Dmitri
Demidenko

The Bank of England has to make a difficult choice. The regulator will
either signal an interest rate hike to curb inflation or keep borrowing
costs unchanged and support the UK economy. What will the BoE choose?
Let us discuss the Forex outlook and make up a [GBPUSD][1] trading plan.

## Weekly pound fundamental forecast

The expectations for the central bank’s rate hike in 2022 should
strengthen the local currency. Money markets expect the BoE to raise the
interest rate twice, in May and December next year. However, the pound
is trading down. The [GBPUSD][1] has dropped to monthly lows, whose
breakthrough will send the price lower. The BoE can influence the pound
trend, so [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s naturally focus on the central bank’s September
meeting.

Speculators have become net sellers of the sterling for the first time
since December 2020. They worry that the interest rate hike will set
back the UK economy, which is still weak. The pandemic fallout and
Brexit have left household budgets in serious trouble amid rising
prices, an energy crisis, and the end of the Treasury fiscal stimulus
programs. The lack of labour force and goods creates problems for
business. The UK economy risks facing stagflation, which is not the best
time to buy the pound.

### Dynamics of [GBPUSD][1] and pound speculative positions

There seem to be much more barriers to the UK economic recovery than
earlier expected. The recession from which the UK growth has to recover
is still the deepest among the advanced economies, so hedge funds are
not willing to invest in the GBP. Speculators fear that, unlike the Fed,
the Bank of England will give a dovish surprise.

### Difference between current and pre-pandemic GDP levels

At its previous meeting, the BoE suggested that tightening monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) would be required to contain inflationary pressures. Looking at
the acceleration of consumer prices to 3.2% in August, the highest level
since 2012, one could assume that in September, the Monetary Policy
Committee should signal a soon interest rate hike. In fact, the
situation is more complex. The most recent data on the GDP rate, retail
sales, and PMI look disappointing. The monetary restriction doesn’t seem
to be relevant when the economy is facing a downturn.

Furthermore, the pound is quite responsive to changes in global risk
appetite. The S&P 500 correction affects the [GBPUSD][1] bulls in the
same way as the UK economic recession. In this regard, the growth of the
US stock indexes in response to the September FOMC meeting’s results is
good [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) for the sterling. The equities must have been bought on the
fact after a sell-off on the [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) about the Fed’s willingness to start
monetary normalization.

### Weekly [GBPUSD][1] trading plan

If the BoE sounds optimistic about the economic growth, featuring a
downturn, and signals an interest rate hike in 2022, the [GBPUSD][1]
will go towards 1.3675, 1.3725, and 1.3755, where one should sell the
pair on the rebound from resistances. Otherwise, the regulator’s
pessimism will result in the downtrend continuation towards 1.348 and
1.341.
