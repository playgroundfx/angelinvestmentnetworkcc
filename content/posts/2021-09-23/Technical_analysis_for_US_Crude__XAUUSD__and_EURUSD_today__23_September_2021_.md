Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 23.09.21Alex Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

The gold chart worked out the flag pattern and the price reached the
primary upside target yesterday.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

The oil price has again reached the resistance, Target Zone 72.85 –
72.32. The short-term uptrend continues. The price will rise higher when
buyers break out the resistance and consolidate above. In this case, the
new upside target will be Gold Zone 75.12 — 74.87.

Otherwise, there will start a correction down, whose target will be the
test of Additional Zone 71.17 – 71.04. In AZ, one could enter a long
trade according to the pattern with a target at yesterday’s high.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

Buy according to the pattern in Additional Zone 71.17 - 71.04.
TakeProfit: 72.35. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

The gold price chart worked out the flag pattern yesterday and reached
the primary upside target in the short-term uptrend. The price has
reached Target Zone 1787 – 1783.

After the resistance was reached on the [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) about the Fed meeting,
large traders exited longs, and the price was corrected down to the key
support 1766 - 1764. Enter buy trades in the key support zone according
to the pattern with a target at yesterday’s high.

If the Intermediary Zone 1766 – 1764 is broken out downside, the trend
will reverse down and it will be relevant to sell with a target in the
lower Target Zone 1746 — 1741.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

Buy according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 1766 - 1764.
TakeProfit: 1786. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

Yesterday, there was a false breakout of the high of September 21 on the
[news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) from the Fed. The price didn’t break out the resistance Additional
Zone 1.1733 - 1.1715. The next downside target is Gold Zone 1.1645 —
1.1636.

The euro price is now being corrected, approaching Additional Zone
1.1732 - 1.1727. After the Additional Zone test, we shall again look for
sell entries.

If the price breaks out Additional Zone upside, one could consider
entering buy trades with a target in Intermediary Zone 1.1780 — 1.1771.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:
