Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 23.09.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

The [cryptocurrency price](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/cryptocurrency-price/)s should continue declining.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

The BTCUSD market continues forming a descending impulse. Sub-waves 1
and 2 completed. There is unfolding the third wave as a bearish impulse
[1]-[2]-[3]-[4]-[5]. Sub-waves [1]-[2] must have completed, so the
market will continue declining in the down wave [3] to a level of
37233.00. Therefore, one should enter short trades at the current
levels.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Sell 44174.00, TP 37233.00

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

The XRPUSD market continues forming the bearish impulse wave. Sub-waves
1 and 2 have finished, and there is forming the initial part of the
third wave. There have completed sub-waves [1]-[2] and (1)-(2) of a
smaller degree. The Ripple price should be declining in wave (3) to a
level below 0.805. An approximate trajectory of the Ripple future price
movement is outlined in the chart.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] **** today:

Sell 1.005, TP 0.805

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

The ETHUSD market is forming the initial part of the down impulse
1-2-3-4-5. It has been half-complete. The bearish impulse wave 3 is now
developing; it is composed of sub-waves [1]-[2]-[3]-[4]-[5]. Sub-wave
[3] should end at a level of 2520.00. Next, the price will go up a
little in correction [4] and continues declining in wave [5]. I
recommend selling the pair in the current situation.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Sell 3112.94, TP 2520.00
