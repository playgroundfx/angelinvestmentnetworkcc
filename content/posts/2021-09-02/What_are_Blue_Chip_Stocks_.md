How to Invest in Blue-Chip Stocks WiselyJana Kane

In order to become a successful [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/), you must acquire a solid
knowledge of advanced financial tools. That’s why comprehension of how
blue-chip stocks work is one of the key skills a prosperous [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)
should possess to stay at the forefront of finance.

The article covers the following subjects:

In this article, we share the fullest information on blue-chip stocks
and provide the reasons why these stocks never lose their popularity.

## What Are Blue-Chip Stocks?

Blue-chip stocks are giant companies that can boast an immaculate
reputation they have been earning for years. The main distinctive
features of such business entities are financial stability, a well-
designed infrastructure, impressive earnings reports, and a solid
[history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) of sustained growth.

Blue-chip stocks manage colossal cash flows and usually have a market
capitalization in billions of dollars, thus taking the leading positions
in respective business sectors. It’s commonly believed that the name
“blue chip” was derived from poker, as the most expensive chips were
usually that color.

  * Paying dividends is not imperative for a blue-chip stock; however, most elite companies have long records of delighting their [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s with stable or even rising consecutive annual dividends because dividends are a way of offsetting for investing money in a company.
  * A blue-chip stock often belongs to the group of the world’s biggest household names.
  * How big and well-established a company needs to be in order to qualify for blue-chip status is a debatable question. Most financial experts agree that a market cap of $5 billion is an acceptable benchmark.
  * An attractive blue-chip stock is typically a pillar of the most reliable and time-tested market indexes, e.g., the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the NASDAQ-100 in the US, the FTSE Index in the UK, or the TSX-60 in Canada.

All these facts make blue-chip stocks extremely popular among traders,
who are attracted by the companies’ long-term strength and annual
dividend payments. Boeing Co. and Procter & Gamble are the perfect
examples of blue-chip stocks.

## Blue-chip stocks: pros and cons

Pros| Cons  
---|---  
High stability in times of crises| Low volatility (price growth rate)  
High capitalization of companies| Suitable only for long-term trading
strategies  
Stable growth of prices and profits|  
Ability to earn on price speculations|  
Dividends are paid to shareholders|  
Minimum risk of the drop in the stock prices|  
  
## What Makes Blue-Chip Stocks a Worthwhile Investment?

There is a broadly held belief among risk-averse [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s that blue-
chips can cope with severe market challenges of any kind. That’s partly
true, but market fluctuations deprive you of a 100% guarantee. The
feature of this large market is its volatility - such infamous stock
sell-offs as Black Mondays and Black Thursdays speak for themselves.
Blue-chip stocks are the least affected equities in times of such
events.

Although blue-chip stocks have been proving their relative stability
over decades, it’s crucial to diversify your portfolio beyond only one
type of stock. Even with a list of companies you consider rock-solid,
you shouldn’t invest exclusively in their stocks to make up the bulk of
your portfolio.

Diversification is an essential investing technique that is applied to
spread your money among various classes of stocks. Choose companies from
contrasting industries and different geographical locations, and make
sure your portfolio includes stocks with all types of market
capitalization (small, medium, and large).

Needless to say, investing in a few blue-chip stocks is still a wise
choice, as their reliability makes them nearly immune to market
downturns.

## How to Start Investing in Blue-Chip Stocks

Start investing in blue-chip stocks by simply adding them to your
investment portfolio; this process can be organized through the help of
a broker. This is what you need to do to start investing in a smart way:

  * Review the latest annual and quarterly reports published by the company to evaluate its performance. It’s also essential to familiarize yourself with any changes in the management of the entity.
  * Conduct thorough research of the stock’s performance for the last ten years to get the most precise statistics on the dividend payments trend and the revenue fluctuations. Analyzing a company’s activity over a long time period will shed some light on the global picture of its performance during both boom and bust cycles.
  * Analyze a bunch of premium stocks and make a choice in which of them to invest, based on the results of your research and personal investment preferences. The world’s most influential agencies recommend mitigating the potential risks through stock diversification, so the best option is to choose several blue-chip stocks to start with.

Investors can either buy or trade stocks through a brokerage.

1\. Stock Investing

Stocks can be bought individually or purchased as a basket of a
diversified common stock fund when you invest in mutual or exchange-
traded funds ([ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/)s). However, investing in funds assumes operating with
considerable sums of money, which is not an option for everyone. If you
decide to purchase stocks through a brokerage, there are several [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/)
available. Depending on your needs, you can choose a full-service
broker, an online broker, or a discount broker.

2\. Stock Trading

There is also a possibility to trade stocks. In this case, you don't own
the stocks, but you can trade on the fluctuations of their price same as
on the [FX market][1]. Such investment products are known as stock CFDs,
where CFD stands for "contracts for difference." You can trade either
stocks or indices, which are primarily composed of blue-chip stocks.

[LiteForex][2] offers a wide range of broker services, starting from the
evaluation of a blue-chip stock’s performance against the goals of the
preferable investment strategy and up to general [advisor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/expert-advisor/)y on [how to](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-trading-how-to/)
perform your own research properly. LiteForex can guide you through the
registration process and help make your first deposit. From that moment,
you will be able to place orders and buy any stocks.

Trading can bring a higher profit than stock investing. Fluctuating
dividend payments hide risks for [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s.

## Blue-Chip Stocks With Big Payouts

Most blue-chip shares supply their [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s with consistent dividends
without slippage, thus becoming a great addition to every [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)'s
portfolio. Profitability and dividend yields for some blue-chip stocks,
such as, for example, Vodafone or Shell, are sometimes near [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/)
highs. High dividend yields vary in percentage, but some of them can
offer a solid figure of around 15%.

Investors often predict future blue-chip stock values, making their
assumptions on the current situation with dividend payments. If the
dividends paid by a company are high enough, it automatically means that
the stock price will significantly increase in the next few years.

Blue-chip stocks’ long-lasting financial stability and high dividend
payout ratios make them a tasty morsel for many [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s. However,
reviewing a company’s fundamentals before making a choice is still a
good decision - make sure its financials seem optimistic.

## World’s Most Wanted Blue-Chip Stocks

As it has already been mentioned, a blue-chip stock is generally a big
household name. Even people who are far from investing and trading will
instantly recognize a blue-chip company’s name. These companies produce
the most demanded and appreciable products or services that are used by
millions of people across the globe. Here is a sample list of a few of
the best blue-chip stocks on the market:

among bullish [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s.

#### Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B)

Berkshire Hathaway stands alone on this list, as it’s not manufacturing
but a holding company. This American company was founded in 1839 and is
now owned by Warren Buffet, one of the most influential and successful
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s. Buffet himself holds considerable shares in several blue-chip
stocks, e.g., Apple and American Express.

### Are Blue-Chip Stocks Really That Safe?

Summing up everything mentioned above, blue-chip stocks can be fairly
considered safe investment instruments even on the choppy stock market.
They have to be well-capitalized in order to join the elite blue-chip
group, and that’s worth something. However, even a blue-chip stock might
have a BBB-credit rating, and if it does, its safety and stability are
called into question.

History speaks for itself. For instance, before the Great Recession, the
lion’s share of [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s considered General Motors (NYSE: GM) a blue-
chip stock. It was well-capitalized, well-known, well-established - you
can continue the list with any adjective that starts with “well.’”
However, in 2008, the company’s financial situation sharply
deteriorated, forcing GM to file for bankruptcy in 2009, causing huge
losses for its [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s.

Let’s consider a more recent case of General Electric (NYSE: GE), a
company that was once the bluest of all blue chips. This industrial
giant is not bankrupt yet, but its financial struggles have already
turned it into a shadow of the former glorious entity. Trying to pay
down debt, the company had to sell several businesses, which has
significantly impaired the total value of GE.

Investing is always about risks, and even blue-chip stocks are not
completely safe. However, they are indeed the safest investment tools
presented on the stock market today.
