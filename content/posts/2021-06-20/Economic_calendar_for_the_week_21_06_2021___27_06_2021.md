Economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the week 21.06.2021 – 27.06.2021Jana Kane

##  **Review of the main events of the Forex economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the
next trading week (21.06.2021 – 27.06.2021)**

 **Trading on key Forex [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/): next week we expect the publication of
important macro statistics from Germany, the UK, the US, Canada, as well
as the results of the meeting of the central banks of the UK and
China.**

The US dollar has strengthened significantly last week, despite the
ongoing decline in the yield of US 10-year government bonds for 5 weeks
in a row. The DXY dollar index added 170 points over the week, gaining
almost 2%.

At the meeting last week, the Fed leaders kept key interest rates in the
range of 0.00%-0.25%, while the volume of the QE asset purchase program
remained at the same level of $120 billion per month.

The accompanying statement said that the Fed will continue to adhere to
the current parameters of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) until the target levels for
inflation and maximum employment are reached, and the level of interest
rates will not change. However, the Fed is now forecasting two rate
hikes in 2023, while earlier central bank officials had pledged not to
raise rates until the end of 2023.

Thirteen out of the eighteen central bankers said they expect short-term
interest rates to rise by the end of 2023, compared with just seven of
them in March. Seven representatives of the FOMC against 4 in March
expect the start of rate hikes as soon as in 2022.

Probably, these changes in expectations regarding the prospects of the
Fed monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) alerted [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s and provoked a massive closure of
short positions in the dollar, which caused its sharp strengthening.

Nevertheless, the official position of the Fed leaders remained the
same. Central bankers want to push the economy closer to "peak
employment" and sustain a 2.0% annual inflation rate before phasing out
asset purchases. According to them, these goals must be achieved before
the regulator moves on to raise rates.

Next week, financial market participants will also pay attention to the
publication of important macro statistics from Germany, the UK, the US,
Canada, and the results of the meetings of the central banks of the UK
and China.

 **Traders should pay attention to the publication of the following
macro indicators:**

 ***during the coming week, new events may be added to the [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) and
/ or some scheduled events may be canceled**

 ****GMT time**

###  **Monday, June 21**

###  **01:30 CNY The People's Bank of China interest rate decision**

Since May 2012, the People's Bank of China has been steadily cutting
interest rates in support of Chinese manufacturers. The bank last
lowered the rate in April 2020 (by 0.20% to 3.85% at the moment).

In 2020, amid international trade conflicts and a slowdown in the global
economy, the world's largest central banks took the path of easing their
monetary policies in order to support national economies and increase
the competitiveness of goods exported from these countries.

The People's Bank of China is also in line with this process. The
depreciation of the yuan became especially relevant in the last 2 years,
when the confrontation between the two most powerful economies in the
world began. One of the measures to mitigate the negative consequences
of increased duties on the import of Chinese goods into the United
States was the depreciation of the national currency of China. This
measure was intended, among other things, to maintain the same volumes
of imports of Chinese products to the United States, which would cost
American buyers less due to the difference in the rates of the national
currencies of the United States and China.

The coronavirus has become an additional strong negative factor.

Probably, at this meeting, the People's Bank of China will keep the
interest rate at the same level of 3.85%, although a rate cut is also
possible.

Nevertheless, if the People's Bank of China makes unexpected statements
or decisions, volatility may increase in the entire financial market.
Investors will also be interested in the bank's assessment of the
consequences of the coronavirus for the Chinese economy and its [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
in the near future in this regard.

###  **01:30 AUD Retail Sales Index**

The Retail Sales Index is published monthly by the Australian Bureau of
Statistics and measures total retail sales. The index is often
considered an indicator of consumer confidence and reflects the health
of the retail sector in the near term. A rise in the index is usually
positive for the AUD; a decrease in the indicator will negatively affect
the AUD. Previous index value (for April) +1.1%. If the data turns out
to be weaker than the previous value, the AUD may sharply decline in the
short term, but if it's above the previous values, the AUD is likely to
strengthen.

###  **12:30, 14:00 EUR Speech by head of the ECB Christine Lagarde**

During the speech of the head of the ECB Christine Lagarde, the
volatility of trading increases not only in the euro and European stock
indices, but throughout the financial market, especially if she touches
on the topic of the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the Central Bank. Any hints at
curtailing the QE program in the Eurozone will cause the euro to rise.
The soft tone of Christine Lagarde's speech and the propensity to
continue the extra soft monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the ECB will negatively
affect the euro.

Speeches of the head of the ECB after the bank's meetings have a
particularly strong influence on the market. In previous periods, the
speech of the head of the ECB in similar situations could cause a change
in the euro rate by more than 3%. If Christine Lagarde does not touch
upon the topic of the ECB's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), then the reaction to her
speech will be weak.

###  **Tuesday, June 22**

###  **18:00 USD The Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's speech in Congress**

The Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will speak to Congress on economics and
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). His comments could affect both short-term and long-term
USD trading if he again touches on the Fed's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). A more
hawkish stance on the Fed's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) is seen as positive and
strengthens the US dollar, while a more cautious stance is seen as
negative for the USD.

If he makes unexpected statements, the volatility in trading in the
financial markets may increase.

During the recent (June) meeting, the Fed leaders kept key interest
rates in the range of 0.00% -0.25%, and the volume of the QE asset
purchase program remained at the same level of $120 billion per month.
The accompanying statement said that the Fed will continue to adhere to
the current parameters of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) until the target levels for
inflation and maximum employment are reached, reiterating that the level
of interest rates will not change.

Nevertheless, the rhetoric of statements from the Fed leadership alerted
market participants betting on further weakening of the dollar. The Fed
is now forecasting two rate hikes in 2023, while earlier central bank
officials had pledged not to raise rates until the end of 2023.

Any hints from Powell confirming the possibility of a tougher approach
to the Fed's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) will cause the dollar to strengthen again.
His statements about the need for an even softer central bank [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
will cause the dollar to fall and American stock markets to rise.

Financial market participants will carefully study his speech in order
to catch signals regarding the further actions of the Fed. If he does
not touch on the topic of the Fed's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), the reaction to his
speech will be weak.

###  **23:50 JPY Bank of Japan Monetary Policy Committee Meeting**

At this meeting, the Bank of Japan's Monetary Policy Committee will once
again summarize the results of last week's meeting of the Bank, analyze
the economic situation in Japan and give indications on possible future
prospects for the Bank of Japan's financial [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).

If the tone of the minutes of the meeting indicates the firmness of
intentions of the Bank of Japan regarding monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) in the
country, it will negatively affect the Japanese stock market and
strengthen the yen. Conversely, a soft rhetoric about the bank's
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) prospects will contribute to the weakening of the yen
and the growth of the Japanese stock market.

volatility of trading will increase not only in the euro and European
stock indices, but throughout the financial market, especially if it

does not touch upon the topic of the ECB's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), the reaction
to her speech will be weak.

###  **Thursday, June 24**

###  **00:00 EUR European Council meeting (all day)**

This meeting is held with the participation of the heads of state and
government of the countries of the European Council. The purpose of this
meeting is, among other things, to discuss the current situation in the
world and European economy. The meeting will last all day. After its
completion, an official statement on the results of the meeting is
published, which may have an impact on the European and world financial
markets.

###  **06:45 JPY Speech by head of the Bank of Japan Haruhiko Kuroda**

In his speech, the head of the Bank of Japan Haruhiko Kuroda is likely
to give some comments on the bank's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). Following the
meeting, the Board of the Bank of Japan decided by a majority vote to
leave the key rate at -0.1%, and the target level of yield on 10-year
government bonds - around zero. The bank did not change the guidelines
for further monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) adopted earlier, and reiterated that it will
keep interest rates at an extremely low level "for an extended period."
"It is necessary to patiently continue to ease monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)," said
the Governor of the Bank of Japan Kuroda. Markets tend to react
noticeably to Kuroda's speeches when he touches on monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).
Volatility at such moments usually grows not only in the yen trade, but
throughout the Asian and global financial markets. If he does not touch
on monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) issues, the reaction to his speech will be weak.

###  **11:00 GBP Bank of England's interest rate decision. Minutes of
the meeting of the Bank of England. Planned volume of asset purchases by
the Bank of England. Monetary Policy Report**

In March (11 March and 19 March) 2020, during its extraordinary
meetings, the Bank of England cut its interest rate twice, bringing it
to the level of 0.1%, and announced its intention to purchase UK
government bonds in the amount of 200 billion British pounds, trying to
counteract economic damage from the coronavirus pandemic. The central
bank announced an increase in its bond portfolio to £645bn, then to
£745bn and to £895bn from £445bn at the time. "The current situation is
completely unprecedented," said Governor of the Bank of England Andrew
Bailey during a press conference after an emergency meeting on March 19.
Bailey said he expects a sharp economic contraction due to the
coronavirus, and the Bank of England is ready to take further stimulus
measures if necessary. “No, we are not done yet,” he said. Based on
these statements by Andrew Bailey, it is fair to expect further actions
from the Bank of England towards easing its monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). It is
possible that at this meeting on June 24, the Bank of England will again
undertake them, increasing the volume of purchases of bonds or lowering
the interest rate. Although, most economists believe that the Bank of
England will refrain from these actions for now.

Also at this time, the minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of
the Bank of England are published with the distribution of votes "for"
and "against" raising / lowering the interest rate. The main risks for
the UK after Brexit are associated with expectations of a slowdown in
the country's economic growth, as well as with a large current account
deficit in the UK balance of payments.

The intrigue about the further actions of the Bank of England remains.
And in trading the pound and the FTSE100 index, a lot of trading
opportunities are there during the period of publication of the bank's
decision on rates.

Also at the same time, the Bank of England's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) report will
be published, containing an assessment of the economic outlook and
inflation. At this time, the volatility in the pound quotes may rise
sharply. Apart from GDP, one of the main benchmarks for the Bank of
England regarding the prospects for monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) in the UK, is the
inflation rate. If the tone of the report is soft, the British stock
market will receive support, and the pound will decline. Conversely, the
tough rhetoric of the report on containing inflation, which implies an
increase in interest rates in the UK, will lead to a strengthening of
the pound.

###  **12:30 USD Durable goods orders. Capital goods orders (ex defense
and aviation). Annual US GDP for Q1 (final estimate)**

This indicator reflects the value of orders received by manufacturers of
durable goods and capital goods (capital goods are durable commodities
used to produce durable goods and services) involving large investments.
The goods produced in the defense and aviation sectors of the US economy
are not included in this indicator. A strong result strengthens the USD.
Previous values ​​of the indicator "durable goods orders": -1.3% in
April, +1% in March, -1.2% in February, +3.4% in January 2021, +1.2% in
December , +1.3% in November, +1.8% in October, -18.3% in April, -16.7%
in March, +2.0% in February, -0.2% in January 2020.

Previous values ​​of the indicator "capital goods orders excluding
defense and aviation": +2.2% in April, +1% in March, -0.9% in February,
+0.6% in January 2021, +1.5% in December, +1.2% in November, +1.9% in
September, +2.1% in August, -6.6% in April, -1.3% in March, -0.6% in
February, +0.9% in January 2020.

In theory, the relative growth of the indicator has a positive effect on
the dollar; the market reaction to its negative value may be negative
for the dollar in the short term. Data worse than the previous value
will also negatively affect the dollar quotes.

Forecast for May: +1.9% (durable goods orders), + 1.5% (capital goods
orders excluding defense and aviation).

It seems that the growth of indicators continues after their recovery in
previous months from a strong drop in March and April 2020, which should
have a positive effect on the dollar quotes. Better-than-expected data
will also have a positive impact on the dollar.

GDP data is one of the key indicators (along with data on the labor
market and inflation) for the Fed in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of its monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).
Strong result strengthens the US dollar; weak GDP report negatively
affects the US dollar. In the previous 4th quarter, GDP grew by +4.3%
after rising +33.4% in Q3 2020, and after falling -31.4% in Q2 and -5.0%
in Q1 2020.

If the data indicate a decline in GDP in the 1st quarter, the dollar
will be under pressure. The positive data on GDP will support the dollar
and the American stock indices, although they are already mostly priced
in. The preliminary forecast for the 1st quarter of 2021 was +6.4%.

###  **Friday, June 25 Июня**

###  **00:00 EUR European Council meeting (all day)**

This meeting is held with the participation of the heads of state and
government of the countries of the European Council. The purpose of this
meeting is, among other things, to discuss the current situation in the
world and European economy. The meeting will last all day. After its
completion, an official statement on the results of the meeting is
published, which may have an impact on the European and world financial
markets.
