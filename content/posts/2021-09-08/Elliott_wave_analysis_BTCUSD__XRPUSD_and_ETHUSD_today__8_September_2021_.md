Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 08.09.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

All three cryptocurrency pairs covered in the article have started
following new bearish trends.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

It is clear from the most recent section of the BTCUSD chart that the
long-term corrective sub-wave [B] composed of sub-waves (A)-(B)-(C)
completed. Next, the price has started falling. There should be forming
a new bear impulse wave. Waves 1 and 2 seem to have completed. The price
should continue declining in impulse 3 to a level below the low of
41800.00, marked by wave 1.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Sell 46678.00, TP 41800.00

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

The XRPUSD market completed the linking wave (X) composed of sub-waves
A-B-C. Next, the market has started declining. Based on the initial part
of the new wave, there is forming an impulse that will be composed of
sub-waves 1-2-3-4-5. It is clear from the chart that sub-waves 1 and 2
completed. The Ripple price should continue declining in impulse 3 to a
level below 0.950, marked by wave 1. One could enter sell trades in the
current situation.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] **** today:

Sell 1.111, TP 0.950

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

Like other cryptocurrency pairs, the ETHUSD market is falling. There
should be developing a new downward impulse. The first two sub-waves of
a smaller degree 1 and 2 must have finished, and the market should
continue moving down in wave 3 to a level below 2895.00, marked by wave
1. One could open sell positions in the current situation.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Sell 3465.13, TP 2895.00
