What Are the Major Types of Stocks On the Market?Jana Kane

Achieving financial success today is inconceivable without basic
knowledge of fundamental investing principles. One can hardly employ
investment strategies if they haven’t dived into researching such
significant securities as stocks, also known as equities or shares. The
stock market has been operating for centuries and is characterized by
high volatility, which contributes to more significant income.

Stocks are broken down into multiple categories and classifications. For
an aspiring [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/), it’s crucial to distinguish between the different
types of stocks available on the market. This article outlines the most
popular varieties of equities that are always in high demand.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Common Stocks vs. Preferred Stocks

A stock is a security that represents an investment in a company. A
company has the right to sell the units of its stocks, called “shares,”
which are generally issued as either common or preferred stocks.

### Common Stocks

Сommon stock is widely considered the most popular stock to invest in,
hence the name. It embodies the proof of partial ownership in a company.
If the company dissolves in the future, the respective shareholders have
the right to get a proportional share of the remaining assets’ value.
However, they will always be at the end of the line and will receive the
remaining shares (if there will be any left) of the asset only when the
holders of bonds and preferred stocks get theirs.

Theoretically, common stocks provide their owners with unlimited upside
potential. However, there is a genuine risk of losing the invested money
- in the event that the company ceases to exist without any valuable
assets left.

### Preferred Stocks

Preferred stock is a hybrid security that adopts common characteristics
of both bonds and stocks. Even though the holders of preferred stocks
don't own any shares, they receive fixed dividends. The rate of dividend
on preferred stocks is either a percentage of the nominal value of
shares or an absolute number; it never depends on the company’s revenue.
To some extent, preferred stocks are similar to the fixed-income market,
and this fact also makes them sensitive to changes in interest rates.
That’s why this type of stock is attractive to [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s only when the
interest rates are stable or about to decrease.

Holders of preferred stocks obtain the pre-emptive right to claim
ownership of the asset's part upon liquidation of the company. These
privileges don't come for free, as [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s have to sacrifice their
voting rights and are not eligible to participate in the company's
management.

Preferred stock provides its holder with the right to get back a certain
sum of money upon the company’s demise. Preferred shareholders are also
the first to receive dividend payments; therefore, they are given an
edge over common shareholders. Companies typically offer only regular
common stocks.

 | Common stock| Preferred stock  
---|---|---  
Advantages|

  * Voting rights
  * Ownership of a company
  * Higher long-term returns

|

  * Higher fixed dividends
  * Guaranteed recovery in the event of the company’s bankruptcy
  * Lower volatility of shares’ prices

  
Disadvantages|

  * Dividends are not guaranteed and can be paid only upon approval by the Board of Directors
  * Dividends are paid only when the holders of bonds and preferred stocks get their payouts
  * Higher volatility of shares’ prices
  * Risk of losing money if the company is dissolved

|

  * No voting rights (generally)
  * Lower long-term potential of growth

  
Suitable for| Conservative [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s who are interested in long-term
growth potential| Investors interested in gaining higher and more stable
income  
  
## Classification of Stocks: Company Size

The words “large-cap,” “mid-cap,” and “small-cap” refer to market
capitalization, which reflects the actual market value of a company. The
market capitalization of a company is calculated by multiplying the
number of shares by a share price. Companies are usually divided into
three groups by size:

### Large-Cap Stocks

Shares of well-established and well-known companies with a market value
of $10 billion or more are known as large-cap stocks. The net worth of
such companies can exceed the economic capacity of some small countries.

The only downside of large-cap stocks is that their prices are stagnant,
as it's pretty challenging to snowball when you are already an industry
giant and lead the respective market. However, they successfully
compensate for this drawback by rewarding [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s with a sustainable
increase of share value in the long run. Here are few examples of well-
known large-cap companies:

  * Google ([GOOG][1])
  * Johnson & Johnson ([JNJ][2])
  * Facebook ([FB][3])

Even though [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s usually consider large-cap inputs less risky than
small-cap ones, conducting thorough research before purchasing any type
of stock is a wise decision. Such financial vehicles as [mutual fund](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-vs-mutual-fund/)s
diversify your portfolio and make it possible to invest in several
large-cap entities at once. Thus, you don't have to spend much time
researching individual stocks to make a safe investment.

### Mid-Cap Stocks

The shares of medium-size companies with a market value from $2 up to
$10 billion are known as mid-cap stocks. These businesses have promising
growth potential, so investing in their stocks is less risky than in the
equities of small-cap companies.

If you want your investment portfolio to be well-diversified, consider
including some mid-cap stocks. Middle-size companies can seem stable,
but it's never redundant to check their track record.

### Small-Cap Stocks

The shares of ownership of small companies with a market value from $300
million to $2 billion are known as small-cap stocks. They have
tremendous growth potential; however, such stocks expose [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s to
significant risks during economic downturns. Small-cap businesses lack a
reliable financial cushion to help them withstand business depression or
bad management.

## Growth Stocks vs. Value Stocks

Stocks can also be categorized by the investing style applied to them.
The most remarkable equities from this group are growth stocks and value
stocks.

### Growth Stocks

Growth stocks represent companies that have the future potential to
predominate the market. As the name implies, growth stocks never stop
growing; once they do,  they are no longer growth stocks. If it happens,
their share price usually abruptly drops unless the slowdown is
considered natural for a maturing company. Very few growth stocks pay
dividends, so most growth [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are focused on the rapidly growing
share prices.

Investors value growth stocks for their attractive growth rates, but
there is always a chance that the stock price won't follow the company’s
growth.  Growth in revenue doesn't always result in growth in earnings.

### Value Stocks

Value stocks represent businesses that were misvalued by the market.
Their stock price doesn't accurately reflect the actual value of the
company.

The reasons why these stocks were valued incorrectly may vary. For
example, value stocks may suffer guilt by association if other companies
from the same industry experience a period of major challenges.
Investors buy these types of stocks, hoping that the market will someday
realize the true value of a company and the stock price will increase.

Value stocks are used to implement a buy-and-hold strategy, providing
that [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s have enough patience to work it out.

## Income Stocks

Income stocks include shares of mature, well-established companies that
are steady dividend providers. These businesses don’t always have room
for growth; nevertheless, they help shareholders maintain a relatively
secure source of passive income. Dividends represent cash payments used
by the companies to distribute profits to their shareholders. Regular
dividend producers are highly valued among [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s for yielding
favorable returns.

  * Utilities, trustworthy companies that work with basic amenities, are generally assimilated to income stocks for their sustainability.
  * Businesses that have income stocks often issue preferred stocks that represent a perfect source of stable dividends.
  * Income stocks are top-rated among retired people, who frequently use them to pay for retirement expenses.
  * Investors who own income stocks should consider opening a tax-qualified account, e.g., an IRA (individual retirement account). By doing so, the income won't be immediately taxed.

## Classification of Stocks: Location

Stocks can be grouped in accordance with the geographic location of a
company. Therefore, diversification of an investment portfolio is
possible through investing in domestic and international companies. As
for international bonds, you can take into account businesses based in
emerging markets that are poised to expand.

### US Stocks

Stocks of US companies are known all around the world. They are traded
on various stock exchanges and range from the smallest public companies
to industry giants, such as Intel ([INTC][4]) or Netflix ([NFLX][5]).

The most famous and largest stock exchanges in the United States are the
NASDAQ, the American Stock Exchange, and the New York Stock Exchange.

Domestic stock funds in the United States enable their [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s to
operate within the world's most liquid stock market, thus providing them
with a unique opportunity to purchase stocks of the most successful
companies in the world. Most US domestic stocks traditionally deliver
beneficial returns on a risk-adjusted basis, representing key components
of long-term investment portfolios.

When [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s buy shares in a domestic stock fund, the invested money
is used to purchase equities issued by the domestic businesses. The
purpose of [mutual fund](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-vs-mutual-fund/)s is to pool stocks of various companies, so
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s don't have to bother buying stocks individually, which would
be quite impractical.

### International Stocks

International stocks, also known as foreign stocks, are the equities of
companies that operate outside the USA. Foreign stocks can be common and
preferred, but they are always issued by international corporations with
headquarters located outside the United States. Foreign stocks trade
worldwide on different exchanges; in the USA, they are traded in the
form of ADRs (American depositary receipts).

International stocks serve multiple purposes. For instance, they can
strengthen your portfolio by employing diversification or give novel
avenues to the rapid growth of returns on investment.

The explosive expansion of international economies increased the
productivity of enterprises worldwide, and overall improved living
standards will eventually lead to the emergence of such a social
phenomenon as a global middle class. These discernible trends anticipate
significant economic growth outside the USA. With this information in
mind, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s should seriously consider allocating a portion of their
portfolios to international stocks.

## Classification of Stocks: Market Sectors

Stocks can also be subdivided by the type of industry they belong to.
There are 11 basic categories that are in the public eye:

  *  **Utility sector.** The companies from this sector are responsible for basic amenities, such as sewage services, natural gas, electricity, water supply, etc.
  *  **Communication services sector.** These are media companies that bring the Internet and provide telephone and entertainment services.
  *  **Consumer discretionary sector.** This sphere includes companies that sell goods or services of secondary importance, from car manufacturers to hotels and cafes.
  *  **Staple consumer sector.** These are businesses that specialize in producing essential goods, such as food, beverages, tobacco products, and many more.
  *  **Energy sector.** These are energy market leaders: oil and gas producers, pipeline companies, and petrol station operators.
  *  **Financial sector.** This sector refers to banks, mortgage and insurance companies, financial institutions, and brokerages.
  *  **Healthcare sector.** These are biotech businesses, medical device producers, and health insurance companies.
  *  **Industrial sector.** The industrial companies are in charge of manufacturing aerospace and defense equipment plus construction of railroads, machinery, and other heavy industry items.
  *  **Materials sector.** These are producers of mining and forest products, raw materials, and various packaging products. Chemical companies also refer to this sector.
  *  **Real estate sector.** This sector unites every imaginable branch of the real estate industry.
  *  **Technology sector.** This is probably the most rapidly developing sphere at the moment. Tech companies produce software, hardware, semiconductors, and communications devices, and they provide a large scale of IT services.

## Blue-Chip Stocks vs. Penny Stocks

Developing substantial investments is impossible without diversification
of your portfolio. It's vital to consider different types of stocks,
including those based on perceived quality.

### Blue-Chip Stocks

Blue-chip stocks are market royalty, favorites of the business world.
These stocks represent the leaders of the respective industries with
immaculate reputations. Blue-chip companies have earned [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s’ trust
by paying regular dividends for years and have withstood the test of
time with honors. Even though equities of blue-chip companies are not
about the absolute highest returns, their stability and reliability make
them extremely popular among risk-averse [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s. Here are few
examples of the world’s most prominent blue-chip companies:

More information about blue-chip stocks is in our previous article.

### Penny Stocks

In contrast to blue chips, penny stocks represent downscale companies.
Their stock prices are so inexpensive that they typically cost less than
$1 per share. Penny stocks are prone to dangerous schemes, generally
used in speculative business models. Investors are advised to use
extreme caution when availing of this type of stock, as it can easily
drain their entire investments.

## Cyclical Stocks vs. Non-Cyclical Stocks

Periods of prosperity and depression, along with cycles of expansion and
contraction, are essential parts of any national economy. Some companies
are more open to the influence of these business cycles, while others
have a higher resistance.

### Cyclical Stocks

Cyclical stocks include shares of businesses dependent on economic
downturns and expansions. For example, companies that offer travel
services or sell luxury items are the most exposed to risks. This is
because a period of economic slowdown deprives their prospective
customers of the ability to make expensive purchases. It also works the
other way - when the economy is strong, a surge in demand can make such
companies rebound sharply.

### Non-Cyclical Stocks

Non-cyclical stocks are also called defensive or secular stocks. Unlike
cyclical stocks, they are not characterized by impactful fluctuations in
demand. A grocery store chain can serve as an excellent example of non-
cyclical stock, as people will still buy food even if times are tough.
This type of stock shows impressive results as a safe-haven asset during
downturns, while cyclical stock will definitely outperform during a bull
market.

## Dividend Stocks vs. Non-Dividend Stocks

Dividend payments warm the souls of [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s, especially if they are
paid on a regular basis. However, some types of stocks don't provide
dividends.

### Dividend Stocks

Dividend stocks are highly valued among [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s who are looking for
ways to increase their passive income and make it valuable. In order to
qualify as a dividend stock, a company has to pay at least $0.01 per
share.

### Non-Dividend Stocks

Non-dividend stocks compensate for the absence of dividend payouts with
the potential stock price rise over time. Taking into account that even
the most prominent companies don't always pay dividends, this type of
stock can be a good investment. However, the current trend is that more
stocks tend to pay dividends to their shareholders.

## IPO Stocks

IPO (initial public offering) stocks are equities of businesses that
recently went private and now offer their shares to the public. IPOs are
generally treated as up-and-coming stocks, despite the fact that they
may turn volatile. IPO stocks attract the interest of [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s even if
the investment community has no consensus about their growth and profit
potential. A private stock needs at least a year after it becomes
available to the public in order to retain its IPO status.

## What Are the Best Stocks to Invest In?

Every prosperous [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) keeps the existing stock classifications in
mind when employing such a helpful technique as diversification. Each
type of stock has its own pros and cons, so it’s crucial to adopt a
comprehensive approach in order to create a carefully balanced
portfolio. It doesn’t matter what [stocks you invest][6] in if you are
well-informed about companies’ market capitalizations, geographic
locations, and different investing styles. It’s essential to consider
the stock’s category alongside the company’s growth potential.

While all this information might be a bit overwhelming, [Liteforex][7]
can easily guide you through the world of finance, helping you to
achieve estimated goals and build a viable investment plan.
