Yen is into politics. Forecast as of 08.09.2021Dmitri Demidenko

The resignation of Yoshihide Sugi from the post of prime minister, a
growing struggle for leadership in the Liberal Democratic Party, and
capital flows. How are these factors related? What impact do they have
on [USDJPY][1]? Let us discuss the Forex outlook and make up a trading
plan.

## Weekly yen fundamental analysis

What if neither colossal volumes of cheap liquidity, nor negative rates
help to achieve the 2% inflation target? Should the BoJ continue filling
the economy with money, or admit impotence by lowering the CPI target?
While the Bank of Japan adheres to the first option, its former
official, and now the chairman of the board of the world's largest
pension fund, GPIF, Hirohide Yamaguchi, prefers the second. Discussions
on this issue are escalating ahead of the vote for the new leader of the
Liberal Democratic Party, who will become de facto Prime Minister of
Japan in October. But the yen is still looking at the US debt market.

The growth of political risks is interpreted differently by large banks.
Bank of America believes that Japanese [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s will start to invest
more in M&A deals, which will lead to capital outflows and [USDJPY][1]
growth to 116. JP Morgan officials think differently. In their opinion,
the uncertainty will force foreign [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s to stay at home. While high
chances of Taro Kono, a supporter of reforms, to win will contribute to
the inflow of foreign capital to Japan and the yen's strengthening.

Hardly anyone is fooled by the stronger GDP growth in Japan in the
second quarter (+1.9%) than in the first reading (+1.3%) and in the
forecasts of Bloomberg experts (+ 1.6%). The indicator has not been able
to recover from the decline that occurred in January-March. In addition,
the slow expansion of consumer spending in July (+0.7%) paints a bleak
picture for the third quarter.

### Dynamics of Japan's GDP

Source _: Bloomberg._

The yen is losing to the US dollar in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) and
economic growth. However, the Treasury yield, which does not want to
grow, slows down the [USDJPY][1] bulls. A typical example was the pair's
growth against the background of an increase in rates on Treasury bonds,
caused either by new auctions for $120 billion or by the hawkish stance
of the St. Louis Fed's head of James Bullard. The FOMC official said
that the slow growth in the US nonfarm payroll employment would not
force the Fed to end the monetary stimulus program.

The dependence of [USDJPY][1] on external factors reduces the risks of
the pair leaving the consolidation range. Ultimately, the slowdown in
the US economy is a reason to buy Treasuries, and the acceleration of
inflation serves as a signal for the sale of these securities. It is
unlikely that US debt rates will go up only due to the seasonal factor.
You need good reasons for this. This includes the Fed's intention to
normalize monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) despite declining GDP growth in the third
quarter.

### Weekly [USDJPY][1] trading plan

In my opinion, everything will happen like it was described above. You
need to remain optimistic and believe in the victory over COVID-19. In
this case, the labor market will quickly recover, which, together with
increased inflation levels, will force the Fed to stick to monetary
restriction and raise Treasury yields. In this regard, I recommend using
the [USDJPY][2] rebound from the supports at 110.15 and 109.85, or a
breakout of the resistance at 110.45 to enter long trades.
