Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 08.09.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

Yesterday, the oil corrective sell pattern in the zone of 69.51 - 68.75
yielded profits.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

Yesterday, the oil corrective sell pattern in the zone of 69.51 - 68.75
yielded profits. As a result, the Intermediary Zone 67.87 - 67.62 was
reached. It serves as the short-term uptrend's key support.

Today it is profitable to look for purchases according to the pattern in
this zone. The target for purchases will be level 70.33.

Breakout of level 67.17 and price consolidation below are required to
sell oil. In this case, the trend will reverse down, and the target will
be the lower Target Zone 65.32 - 64.81.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

Open buy positions according to the pattern in 67.87 - 67.17.
TakeProfit: 70.33. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

Gold broke out the Intermediary Zone 1813 - 1811 and immediately reached
the Target Zone 1792 - 1788. The short-term trend reversed down. The
further price drop will depend on the sellers' ability to consolidate
the price below the Target Zone. If this happens, the target will be the
Gold Zone 1772 - 1770.

As long as the downtrend continues, it is profitable to look for gold
sales at strong resistance levels. The strong resistances for today are
Additional Zone 1803 - 1802 and Intermediary Zone 1815 - 1813. Wait for
the test of levels, look for a sell pattern, enter sales. The target is
yesterday's low.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

  1. Sell according to the pattern in Additional Zone 1803 - 1802. TakeProfit: 1792. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. Sell according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 1815 - 1813. TakeProfit: 1792. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

The euro price is trading in the correction to a short-term uptrend.
Yesterday, the Additional Zone 1.1865 - 1.1860 was broken out. Now the
downside target is the Intermediary Zone 1.1820 - 1.1812.

After the Intermediary Zone test, look again for purchases according to
the patterns with a target at the September 3 high.

If the Intermediary Zone is broken out, then one should forget about
purchases within the short-term trend. In this case, look for short
trades with the target at the lower Target Zone 1.1733 - 1.1715.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

Buy according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 1.1820 - 1.1812.
TakeProfit: 1.1908. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.
