Forex in May: Greenback is getting strongerDmitri Demidenko

## It is too early to buy the EUR/USD, isn’t it?

The statistics provided by the governments is disappointing (for
example, the data on the number of infected and died from the
coronavirus). However, using statistics in Forex to build investment
strategies is still rather efficient. The market situation in [April][1]
has proved the trading systems based on the seasonal patterns of the G10
currencies to be successful. The sell positions on the [EUR/CAD][2],
EUR/NOK, [USD/CAD][3], and the [USD/NOK][4] increased the deposit by
6.7%, and, if the trader had considered the quick rebound of the WTI
after the crash below zero, the yield could have risen to 13%.
Statistical analysis helps to identify the direction of price trends,
but it is better to consider the entry points using technical and
fundamental tools.

The best-performing currency in May, in 1975-2019, was most often the US
dollar, whose major competitors usually were the safe-haven currencies,
like the yen and the franc. This scenario is generally associated with a
decline in the global risk appetite, as [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are betting on a drop
in the global stock indexes. The chief outsiders in May usually were the
EUR, GBP, and SEK, which closed in the red area in two cases out of
three.

In May, the U.S. dollar grew versus the Swedish krona and the euro by
0.9% on average, versus the pound, it was 0,7% up. In the periods when
the greenback closed in the green area, it rose by 2.9% and 2.2%
respectively. The [best time](https://www.fixpro.org/post/forex-best-time-to-trade/) for the USD/SEK bulls and the bears on the
EUR/USD and the GBP/USD was 2010 when the U.S. economy was recovering
from a recession and 2012 when the euro area suffered from the debt
crisis. In those years, the European currencies were 7%-8% down in a
month.

Of course, it is yet too early to expect the end of the US economic
recession. The same is true for the potential repetition of the European
debt crisis, which can’t be excluded amid the substantial increase in
government spending and a decline in the tax revenues. Nonetheless, the
30% rally of the U.S. stock index up form the March lows amid a
difficult epidemiological situation and the economic downturn, which is
likely to be the worst since the Great Depression in the 1930s, looks
like a bubble. Investors believe that the S&P 500 market will become
bullish faster than the U.S. GDP will rebound. However, as the buyers of
the US stocks understand that the GDP recovery may take quite a long
time, they take profits, exiting longs.

Therefore, the global risk appetite will decline, and it will be
relevant to sell the[ EUR/USD][8], [EUR/JPY][9], [GBP/USD][10], and
[GBP/CHF][11]. The euro may fall even deeper unless the EU leaders find
a compromise on the fiscal stimulus. A worse situation with Brexit will
weigh on the GBP. The S&P 500 correction is the good [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/), first of all,
for the U.S. dollar, while the yen and the franc will strengthen during
the period of the US stock market’s stabilization.
