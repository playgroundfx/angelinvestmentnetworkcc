Bitcoin halving and dollar devaluation. Main market mythsMikhail Hypov

##  **Mythbusters: Halving and dollar devaluation as reason of Bitcoin
price growth**

My previous [Bitcoin forecast was made ][1]on 17th March.  And it was
absolutely correct, until lately.

![LiteForex: Mythbusters: Halving and dollar devaluation as reason of
Bitcoin price growth][2]

My March’s scenario is shown in the chart above. I predicted a high
probability of retracement within a 5-wave structure in wave C. The
target was at around 6,000-7,000 USD. Then I expected a fall to 1,500
USD.

The scenario was pessimistic, but it seemed to be realistic amid those
panics and unfolding crisis.

Bitcoin price growth][3]

The current situation is shown in the chart above. As we see, the things
had been developing according to the forecast. Then there happened a
sharp growth in buyers’ activity while we expected a reversal and retest
of support levels.

Bitcoin price growth][4]

The [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) chart shows that an ascending bearish wedge was forming from
mid-March to almost the end of April. It’s a classic trend continuation
figure and it pointed to a movement to 4,000 USD at least. At the same
time, Tom DeMark’s oscillator showed a bearish divergence. So, my global
scenario was fully confirmed on shorter time frames. All indicated that
the bullish correction was about to finish and the price would continue
to go down.

However, the market disagreed with me and went up instead of producing a
downward impulse at 1,000 USD. That movement broke the whole wave
pattern. The 20% growth was significant and occurred exactly where it
wasn’t supposed to. That was an obvious market anomaly. Delving into its
causes, I found a few delusions the crowd believed in.

###  **Myth no 1. Dollar’s devaluation**

### ![LiteForex: Mythbusters: Halving and dollar devaluation as reason
of Bitcoin price growth][5]

The chart above shows a one-month time frame of the dollar index DXY
which reflects the dollar’s value relative to a basket of 6 foreign
currencies.  As we see from a superficial visual and trend analysis, the
USD didn’t collapse and no devaluation is forecast.  What’s more, growth
is even likelier than a fall, according to trends and the upward
impulse. Fundamental factors explain that too: the US dollar remains the
world’s main reserve currency. US treasury bonds are a popular
protective asset, so the dollar will be demanded too as a means to buy
them.

At the same time, credit money supply will implode since the bank sector
isn’t active. Newly printed dollars will compensate for the reduction
and bring back liquidity to the bank sector.  Those who are shouting
about money bubbles simply don’t understand economic laws. So, the
dollar won’t devalue in the nearest future and will still be highly
demanded.

###  **Myth no 2: Halving will make Bitcoin prices soar**

People are manipulated easily when they are stressed: rational thinking
gets deactivated. That helped manipulators to promote both myth no 1 and
myth no 2. A beginning of a new growth wave has been discussed since the
end of 2019 amid information on future halving.

![LiteForex: Mythbusters: Halving and dollar devaluation as reason of
Bitcoin price growth][6]

However, most participants weren’t too active and the price didn’t soar.
After 2-month procrastination, a chilling collapse followed. Adequate
reasons haven’t been found yet.  However, the answer lies on the
surface. Manipulators understood that halving was a mediocre [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) hook
which wouldn’t boost a craze for crypto. Then they made the rate
collapse to rebuy crypto at a new trough level and strip weak players of
their [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)s. Amid the current global crisis, the story about halving
is relevant again and urges average traders to buy Bitcoins, increasing
over-demand even more.

Many large media platforms launched a halving countdown timer, heating
the fever around this event. Every marketing expert knows this trick and
uses it in sales for heating demand for products and provoking fear of
missing out.  A Bitcoin buyer might even not know what halving is. But
if we look into it, we’ll see it can’t have any impact on the growth of
Bitcoin prices. Halving means that mining profits are cut twice: Bitcoin
miners will get the reward for mining a block cut in half. It means many
miners will leave the market as Bitcoin mining won’t be profitable at
current prices.

Some may say that emission of new [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)s will be cut in half as well.
This counterargument makes no sense because the final emission amount
has already been reflected in the price and was known long ago. For your
reference, the maximum number of Bitcoins equals 21,000,000. What’s
more, halving is what Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin, is
criticized for. If demand for Bitcoin and its price aren’t growing,
halving will become a self-destruction mechanism because miners will no
longer want to maintain Bitcoin’s [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/).

![LiteForex: Mythbusters: Halving and dollar devaluation as reason of
Bitcoin price growth][7]

Also, there are charts where previous halving is marked and which
forecast that the price will continue growing after halving. Halving has
occurred 2 times in the [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) of Bitcoin so far, and it would be
statistically incorrect to try finding regularities based on just 2
cases.

If we attempt to understand why the price behaved that way, we’ll see
that most traders in the young cryptomarket didn’t know what effects
halving would have and how the price would behave. So, they were simply
watching the situation and the price was standing still. Once halving
took place, everyone understood nothing serious happened. So those who
wanted to buy did what they wanted.  Accumulation of buyers’ energy
under low volumes in a bullish market of Bitcoin did what it was
supposed to do: result in an explosive growth.

Bitcoin price growth][8]

The current behaviour of market participants (see chart above) shows
that roaring demand for [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) started before halving. It’s “buying the
rumour”. Every experienced trader will say: “buy the rumour, sell the
[news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/)”. So, it would be naive to expect that the Bitcoin price will soar
after halving. Check my next article and read about Bitcoin’s actual
scenario and what will be after halving.
