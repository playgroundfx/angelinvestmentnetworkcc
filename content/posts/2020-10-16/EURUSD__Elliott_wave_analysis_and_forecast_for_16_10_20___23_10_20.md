EURUSD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 16.10.20 – 23.10.20Alex
Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions from corrections above the
level of 1.1605 with a target of 1.2019 – 1.2100.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
1.1605 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of 1.1375
– 1.1228.

 **Analysis:** Presumably, the first wave 1 continues forming inside the
third wave (3) of larger degree on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame. On the H4 time
frame, the third wave iii of 1 formed, and a local correction developed
as the fourth wave iv of 1. Apparently, the fifth wave of smaller degree
v of 1 is developing on the H1 time frame, with wave (i) of v formed and
a local correction nearing completion as wave (ii) of v inside. If the
presumption is correct, the pair will continue to rise to the levels of
1.2019 – 1.2100. The level of 1.1605 is critical in this scenario. Its
breakout will allow the pair to continue falling to the levels of 1.1375
– 1.1228.
