USDJPY: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 16.10.20 – 23.10.20Alex
Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions from corrections above the
level of 103.94 with a target of 108.14 – 109.84.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
103.94 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of 103.00
– 101.13.

 **Analysis:** On the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame, apparently a descending
correction of larger degree finished forming as wave B. Wave С started
developing, with the first wave 1 of (1) of C formed inside. On the H4
time frame, a descending correction of smaller degree formed as wave 2
of (1), and the third wave 3 of (1) started to develop. Apparently, the
first counter-trend wave (i) of i of 3 is forming on the H1 time frame.
If this assumption is correct, the pair will continue to rise to 108.14
– 109.84.  The level of 103.94 is critical in this scenario, as its
breakout will enable the pair to continue declining to the levels of
103.00 – 101.13.
