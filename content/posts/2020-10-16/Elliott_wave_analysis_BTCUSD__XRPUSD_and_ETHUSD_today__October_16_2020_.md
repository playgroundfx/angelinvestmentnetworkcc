Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 16.10.2020Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I suggest entry signals
to trade each cryptocurrency.

Bitcoin should soon finish forming a corrective wave and continue rising
in the fifth wave, as well as other major cryptocurrencies.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

 ****

There is forming the upward linking wave [X] as a double zigzag. Its
final leg, wave (Y) hasn’t yet finished. It is composed of the sub-waves
A-B-C. Wave A is an impulse, wave B is a simple zigzag, wave C is also
an impulse. The first three legs must have finished within the C
impulse, the price is now going down in the corrective wave [4]. It
should soon complete, and the BTC price will be rising in wave [5] to a
level of 11944, as it is outlined in the chart.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 11277.25, TP 11944.00

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

It is clear from the most recent section of the XRPUSD chart that the
market is following the upward corrective wave, which is a simple zigzag
[a]-[b]-[c]. Wave [c] is still developing as an impulse. A long sideways
corrective wave (4) of this impulse is a double three with the linking
wave x that is a zigzag. This pattern should have completed, so the
Ripple price could be rising in wave (5) to a level of 0.266.

### Trading plan for **[XRPUSD][2]** today:

Buy 0.240, TP 0.266

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

 ****

The ETHUSD market continues forming the corrective wave B as a double
zigzag. There is now developing wave [Y] as a zigzag (A)-(B)-(C). The
(A) impulse and the (B) correction have completed, and the impulse wave
(C) is yet forming. The down corrective wave 4 must have ended, and the
market will be rising in the final wave 5 to a level of 395.38.

### Trading plan  **[ETHUSD][3] **today:

Buy 366.05, TP 395.38
