Economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the week 12.10.2020 – 18.10.2020Jana Kane

##  **Review of the main events of the Forex economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the
next trading week (12.10.2020 – 18.10.2020)**

 **Trading on key Forex [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/): next week we are expecting the publication
of important macro statistics data from the UK, Germany, US, Australia,
China, speeches of heads and key representatives of the central banks of
the Eurozone, Great Britain, as well as the results of the debates of
the US presidential candidates.**

American stock indices are growing while the DXY dollar index, which
reflects the value of the dollar against a basket of 6 major currencies,
fell 0.8% (to 93.10) last week. This is the second consecutive week of
the dollar index declining after its corrective rise from the 28-month
low of 91.74 it reached in September. Investors reacted positively to
[news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) that negotiations on a package of fiscal support for the economy
are still in progress. White House chief economic adviser Larry Kudlow
also confirmed that President Trump has approved a revised fiscal aid
package. Meanwhile, the final agreement between Democrats and
Republicans on this issue has not yet been reached. Republicans are
still in favor of $1.8 trillion in aid, while Democrats are pushing for
$2.2 trillion. Stock indices are growing again, despite alarming [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/)
regarding the acceleration of the spread of coronavirus in the world. As
of Friday, October 9, 36,945,712 cases of Covid-19 were recorded in the
world, and over the previous day (October 8), the number of infected
people increased by 284,888 people. This is an absolute record, and so
far the infection curve is growing.

One way or another, the dollar ended last week in negative territory,
while US stock indexes rose, which nevertheless speaks of positive
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) sentiment.

Investors' attention next week will be on the publication of important
macro data from the UK, Germany, US, Australia, China, speeches by heads
and key representatives of the central banks of the Eurozone, Great
Britain, as well as the debates of the US presidential candidates.

 **Traders should pay attention to the publication of the following
macro indicators:**

 ***during the coming week, new events may be added to the [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) and
/ or some scheduled events may be canceled**

 ****** **GMT time**

###  **Monday, October 12**

No publication of important macro statistics is planned, and it's
holidays in Canada and the US, so the trading volumes will be lower.
However, traders should pay attention to the speech (at 11:00 GMT) by
the head of the ECB Christine Lagarde and to the speech (at 16:00 GMT)
by the head of the Bank of England Andrew Bailey. The market usually
reacts strongly to the speeches of the head of the ECB, which follow
immediately after the meeting of the ECB on monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). At least
this was the case under Mario Draghi. Other appearances by Mario Draghi
elicited less market reaction. If Christine Lagarde makes unexpected
statements regarding the latest ECB meeting and the bank's monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), it will again trigger a surge in volatility in the euro and
European stock indices.

Participants in the financial markets are expecting the head of the Bank
of England Andrew Bailey to clarify the situation regarding the further
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the central bank of Great Britain. Volatility during his
speech usually rises sharply in the quotes of the pound and the London
stock exchange FTSE index if Andrew Bailey gives any hints of tightening
or easing of the Bank of England's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). It is likely that he
will also touch on the state and prospects of the British economy, which
has been badly affected by the coronavirus pandemic and is on the verge
of Brexit, which can still happen according to the hard scenario.

If he does not touch upon the issues of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), the reaction to
his speech will be weak.

The heads of the ECB and the Bank of England are likely to touch upon
the Brexit issue. Brussels insists that the deal be concluded before the
end of this month, so that there is time for its ratification by the end
of this year. London, meanwhile, appears poised to secede from the
European bloc without a trade deal, as British Prime Minister Boris
Johnson has repeatedly stated.

###  **Tusday, October 13**

###  **06:00 GBP Report on the average wages of the British citizens for
the last 3 months. Unemployment rate**

On a monthly basis, the UK Office for National Statistics (ONS)
publishes a report on average earnings covering the last 3 months, with
and without bonuses.

This report is a key short-term indicator of the dynamics of changes in
the level of wages of employees in the UK. Earnings growth is positive
for the GBP, while a low result is negative. Forecast: the October
report suggests that the average wages with bonuses decreased over the
last calculated 3 months (June-August) by -0.4% (against -1.0%, -1.2%,
-0.3 %, +1.0%, +2.4%, +2.8%, +3.1%, +2.9%, +3.2%, +3.2% in previous
periods); without bonuses - increased by +0.6% (against +0.2%, -0.2%,
+0.7%, +1.7%, +2.7%, +2.9%, +3.1%, +3.2%, +3.4%, +3.5% in previous
periods). Thus, data is expected to be below the average values ​​of
indicators. If the data turns out to be better than forecast, the pound
is likely to strengthen in the foreign exchange market in the short
term. Data worse than expected will negatively affect the pound.

Also at this time, the office publishes data on unemployment in the UK.
In the 3 months from June to August, unemployment is expected to be at
4.1% (against 4.1%, 3.9%, 3.9%, 3.9%, 3.9%, 4.0%, 3.9% and 3.8% in
previous periods). Since 2012, the UK unemployment rate has declined
steadily (from 8.0% in September 2012). This is a positive factor for
the pound, the rise in unemployment is a negative factor.

If the data from the UK labor market turn out to be worse than the
forecast and/or the previous value, the pound will be under pressure.

In any case, at the time of the publication of data from the British
labor market, an increase in volatility is expected in the pound quotes
and on the London Stock Exchange.

###  **06:00 EUR Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices  (HICP) in Germany
(final release)**

This index is published by the EU Statistics Office and is calculated on
the basis of a statistical method agreed between all EU countries. It is
an indicator for assessing inflation and is used by the Governing
Council of the ECB to assess the level of price stability. A positive
result strengthens the EUR, a negative one weakens it.

In May, the HICP index (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) increased by +0.5%, in June by
+0.8%, in July - by 0%, and in August it decreased by -0.1%. Forecast
for September: -0.4%. Since this is the second, final assessment, which
coincides with the first assessment, the euro is unlikely to react
strongly to the publication of this indicator. If the data turn out to
be better than the forecast, the euro may strengthen in the short term.
The growth of the indicator is a positive factor for the euro. The data
suggests that inflationary pressures are still low in Germany. The data
is worse than the forecast and the previous value will negatively affect
the euro.

###  **12:30 USD Consumer Price Index (ex food and energy)**

Consumer Price Index (CPI) determines the change in prices of a selected
basket of goods and services for a given period and is a key indicator
for assessing inflation and changes in consumer preferences. Food and
energy have been excluded from this indicator to provide a more accurate
estimate. A high value strengthens the US dollar, while a low score
weakens it. In January the value of the indicator was +0.2% (+2.3% in
annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)), in February +0.2% and +2.4% (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)), in March
-0.1% (+2.1% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)), in April -0.4% (+1.4% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)).
Forecast for September: +0.2% and +1.6% (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)), which
indicates some improvement in the situation after the fall of the index
in March and April. If September data turns out to be weaker than
forecast, then the dollar is likely to respond with a short-term but
strong decline. Better-than-forecast data will strengthen the dollar.

###  **Wednesday, October 14**

###  **08:00 EUR Speech by the ECB President Christine Lagarde**

During the speech of the head of the ECB Christine Lagarde, the
volatility rises not only in the euro and European stock indices, but
also throughout the financial market, especially if she touches on the
topic of the ECB's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). Any hints at curtailing the QE
program in the Eurozone will cause the euro to rise. A soft tone of
Christine Lagarde's speech and the intention to continue the extra soft
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the ECB will negatively affect the euro.

Speeches by the head of the ECB after the bank's meetings have a
particularly strong influence on the market. In previous periods, the
speech of the head of the ECB in similar situations could cause a change
in the euro rate by more than 3%. If Christine Lagarde does not touch
upon the topic of the ECB's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), the reaction to her speech
will be weak.

###  **21:45 AUD Speech by the head of the RBA Philip Lowe**

During his speech, Philip Lowe will assess the current situation in the
Australian economy and point out further plans for the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
of the department. Any signals from him regarding changes in the plans
of the RBA's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) will cause a sharp increase in volatility
in the trading of the AUD and on the Australian stock market. If he does
not touch upon the topic of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), the market reaction to his
speech will be weak.

Market participants would also like to hear Lowe's views on central bank
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) in the face of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and the first
recession in Australia in 30 years.

Earlier this month, the RBA's key interest rate was kept at a record low
of 0.25%, and the target level of 3-year government bonds was also left
at 0.25%. The decision to lower the rate and determine the current
target level of government bond yields was made at an unscheduled RBA
meeting on March 19 in order to support businesses and Australian
citizens amid the rapid spread of the coronavirus pandemic.

In his opinion, "there are no serious arguments in favor of tightening
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) in the short term," and "it will take some time before
interest rates rise."

###  **Thursday, October 15**

###  **00:00 EUR European Council meeting (all day)**

This meeting is attended by the heads of state and government of the
countries of the European Council. The purpose of this meeting is, among
other things, to discuss the current situation in the world and European
economy. The meeting will last all day. After its completion, an
official statement on the results of the meeting is published, which may
have an impact on the European and world financial markets.

###  **00:30 AUD Employment rate. Unemployment rate**

Employment rate reflects the monthly change in the number of Australian
citizens employed. The growth of the indicator has a positive impact on
consumer spending, which stimulates economic growth. A high reading is
positive for the AUD, while a low reading is negative. Forecast: in
September, the number of employed Australian citizens fell by another
-50,000 (after falling by 607,400 in April, by 264,100 in May and an
increase by 111,000 in August).

Also at the same time, the Australian Bureau of Statistics will publish
a report on the unemployment rate - an indicator that assesses the
proportion of the unemployed population to the total number of able-
bodied citizens. The growth of the indicator shows the weakness of the
labor market, which leads to a weakening of the national economy. The
decline in the indicator is a positive factor for the AUD. Forecast:
unemployment in Australia in September was at 6.4% (against 6.8% in
August, 7.5% in July, 7.4% in June, 5.2% in March, 5.1% in February). In
general, the indicators are still not positive. However, in other large
economies, the labor market has deteriorated on an even larger scale due
to the coronavirus.

The leaders of the RBA have repeatedly stated that, in addition to the
situation in international trade, the Australian economy and the central
bank's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) plans are influenced by the indicators of the
level of household debt and spending, the growth of workers' wages, as
well as the state of the country's labor market.

In March 2020, the RB of Australia cut its key interest rate by 0.50% to
a new record low of 0.25% due to the coronavirus, which was the 5th rate
cut in the last year. In the opinion of the RBA management, an
unemployment rate of 4.5% or lower is required to raise wages and
accelerate inflation to the target range. Unemployment in the country is
not declining, and a return of inflation to the middle of the target
range of 2-3% is not even in the distant horizon.

The AUD is unlikely to react positively to the publication of data from
the country's labor market. If the values ​​of the indicators turn out
to be worse than forecast, the Australian dollar may significantly
decline in the short term. Better-than-expected data will strengthen AUD
in the short term.

###  **01:30 CNY Consumer Price Index (CPI)**

The National Bureau of Statistics of China will release the next monthly
data reflecting the dynamics of consumer prices in China. The rise in
consumer prices could trigger an acceleration in inflation, which could
force the People's Bank of China to take measures aimed at tightening
fiscal [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). Increased growth in consumer inflation may cause
appreciation of the yuan, a weak result will put pressure on the yuan.

China's economy is the second largest in the world after America's.
Therefore, the publication of important macroeconomic indicators of this
country has a noticeable impact on world financial markets, primarily on
the position of the yuan, other Asian currencies, the dollar, commodity
currencies, as well as on Chinese and Asian stock indices. China is the
largest buyer of raw materials and a supplier of a wide range of
finished products to the world commodity market.

In January 2020, the growth of the consumer inflation index amounted to
+1.4% (+5.4% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)), and in May - the value of the CPI index
decreased to -0.8% (+2.4% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)).

Deterioration of macroeconomic indicators, including a decrease in
consumer inflation, may negatively affect the positions of the yuan, as
well as commodity currencies such as the Canadian, Australian, and New
Zealand dollars. To a greater extent, this applies to the Australian
dollar, since China is Australia's largest trade and economic partner.

According to the forecast, another acceleration in the growth rate of
the consumer price index is expected in September: +0.4% (+2.4% in
annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) against +0.4% (+2.4% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) in August after its
sharp fall in the previous months.

The growth of the consumer inflation index will have a positive effect
on the quotes of the yuan, as well as commodity currencies, primarily
the Australian dollar. However, a relative decline in CPI may negatively
affect them.

###  **Friday, October 16**

###  **00:00 EUR European Council meeting (all day)**

This meeting is attended by the heads of state and government of the
countries of the European Council. The purpose of this meeting is, among
other things, to discuss the current situation in the world and European
economy. The meeting will last all day. After its completion, an
official statement on the results of the meeting is published, which may
have an impact on the European and world financial markets.

###  **01:00** **USD Presidential debates in the US**

Financial market participants will follow this debate. Economists
believe that under Biden, stronger fiscal stimulus measures can be
expected, which will be highly relevant to economic recovery in the near
term, while under Trump, the prospect of a long period of extremely low
interest rates is more likely to support business activity over a longer
period of time, and this is extremely important for buyers of high-yield
and risky stock assets betting on the further growth of the American
stock market.

At the same time, many economists agree that any outcome of the
presidential election will be positive for the American stock market.
The growth of stock indices, at the same time, will most likely be
accompanied by a fall in the dollar.

###  **12:30 USD Retail Sales (Ex Autos). Retail control group**

This report (Core Retail Sales Ex Autos) reflects the total sales of
retailers of all sizes and types, excluding car dealerships. Changes in
retail sales are the main indicator of consumer spending. The report is
a leading indicator, and in the future, the data may be greatly revised.
A high result strengthens the US dollar, a low one weakens it. A
relative decrease in the indicator may have a short-term negative impact
on the dollar, while an increase in the indicator will have a positive
effect on the USD. In the previous month (August), the indicator
increased by +0.6% (against a decline of -17.2% in April, -4.5% in
March, -0.4% in February).

Retail sales is the main indicator of consumer spending in the United
States, showing changes in retail sales. The Retail Control Group metric
measures volume across the entire retail industry and is used to
calculate price indices for most products. A strong result strengthens
the US dollar, and vice versa, a weak report weakens the dollar. A
slight increase in indicators is unlikely to accelerate the growth of
the dollar. The data worse than the values ​​of the previous period
(-0.1% in August, +1.4% in July, +5.6% in June, +11% in May, -15.3% in
April, +1.7% in March, 0.0% in January and February) will negatively
affect the dollar in the short term.

###  **14:00 USD University of Michigan Consumer Confidence Index
(Preliminary release)**

This indicator reflects the confidence of American consumers in the
country's economic development. A high level indicates economic growth,
while a low level indicates stagnation. Previous indicator values: 99.8
in January, 101.1 in February, 89.1 in March, 71.8 in April, 72.3 in
May, 78.1 in June, 72.5 in July, 74.1 in August, 80.4 in September. An
increase in the indicator will strengthen the USD, while a decrease in
the value will weaken the dollar. This indicator is expected to be
released in October with a value of 81.0. There is still a weak trend
towards a gradual recovery in the growth of the indicator. Data worse
than the forecast may negatively affect the dollar in the short term.
