Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 15.10.2020Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I suggest entry signals
to trade each cryptocurrency.

All the three cryptocurrencies are forming final fifth waves. Therefore,
the markets should be going up today.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

 ****

Bitcoin continues forming the corrective linking wave [X] as a double
zigzag (W)-(X)-(Y). The sub-waves (W) and (X) have completed, and wave
(Y) is about to finish soon as a double zigzag. The market is now rising
in the impulse wave [c] that is composed of five sub-waves
(1)-(2)-(3)-(4)-(5). The bear corrective wave (4) has completed, so the
market should be rising in wave (5) to a level of 11944.00.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 11374.00, TP 11944.00

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

 ****

There is forming the middle part of the large down zigzag. That is
corrective wave B unfolding as a zigzag [a]-[b]-[c]. Wave [c] of this
zigzag is still developing as an ending diagonal. The corrective wave 4
has completed as a double zigzag. Therefore, the price should be rising
in wave 5 to a level of 0.266.

### Trading plan for **[XRPUSD][2]** today:

Buy 0.245, TP 0.266

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

 ****

The most recent section of the ETHUSD price chart displays the final
zigzag [Y], which is composed of three motive sub-waves (A)-(B)-(C).
Wave (A) is a simple impulse, correction (B) is a standard zigzag, wave
(C) is also an impulse currently unfolding. The first four legs of this
impulse have completed, and there is now developing the final wave 5.
The market should be rising in wave 5 to a level of 400.37.

### Trading plan  **[ETHUSD][3] **today:

Buy 375.19, TP 400.37
