Fundamental and technical analysis of PfizerMikhail Hypov

##  **PFE shares: fundamental and technical analysis, reporting and main
macro-indicators, wave structure, key levels, targets and trading
plans.**

This article is devoted to one one the biggest and oldest pharmaceutical
companies in the world -  [Pfizer ][1]Inc. The company was founded by
two German immigrants Charles Pfizer and Charles Erhart. In 1849 they
launched production of an anti-parasitic drug in Brooklyn, USA. The drug
became popular and the company started growing fast. During the Second
World War [Pfizer ][1] becomes the biggest producer and supplier of
penicillin for US soldiers and the Allies.  It quickly develops into a
global company on war contracts. In 1950, it’s represented in North and
South America, Europe and Central Asia. In the 80s and the 90s, the
company grows again after having invented the world’s most popular
drugs:

  * Lipitor, a drug which lowers the level of cholesterol
  * Viagra, a drug for increasing men’s potency

Actually, the company produces a few dozens of drugs, but it owes its
global status and huge market influence to those 2 pharmaceutical best-
sellers. Based on the latest [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/), [Pfizer][1] is getting ready for a
new growth wave: the company made a $2 billion deal with the US
government to produce a coronavirus vaccine. [Pfizer][1] will
manufacture 100 million vaccine doses under this contract, with an
option to produce an additional 500 million doses later. The deal will
yield additional $12 billion to the company. Considering the global
pandemic, many other countries may want to have the vaccine too. The
drug’s price is $19.5, but the whole procedure will cost $40 as a re-
vaccination is required to develop a stable immunity. However, it’s
still a low price for such a complex medicine.  In fact, the company put
an economic barrier to entry for competitors, which will be hard to deal
with. The company’s CEO Albert Bourla says that the drug’s market cost
is higher than announced by [Pfizer][1]. Still, the Company can’t be
guided by the market laws to the prejudice of ethics in the
circumstances of the pandemic.

### Fundamental analysis

Thus, the [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) background suggests the stock’s fast growth in the
nearest future, but long-term investment portfolios can’t be based on
media’s information alone. Let’s have a look at the company’s current
state.

[Pfizer][1]’s total cap exceeds $200 billion. The stock is traded at
NYSE and 5.5 billion shares are distributed as follows:

  * 72.4% large investment funds and other institutional bodies
  * 27.5% public float,
  * 0.05% held by the government
  * 0.05% held by the company’s top management 

According to the company’s reporting, the top management sold the stock
actively at the beginning of May. The insiders sold over 90,000
[Pfizer][1] shares in total.

The sale was at 38 USD per share, which is the current price level. In
other words, [PFE][1] stock price has reached a strong resistance level,
so we must be careful will buying.

Technical analysis. Actual scenarios of price movements][3]

Getting back to fundamentals, the company’s revenue is barely evolving
and located in the range of $10-14 billion based on quarterly reports.
In general, it’s rather a bad sign which indicates stagnancy. The
company’s profits are drained from successful existing products while
new ones haven’t influenced profitability yet. On the whole, the
company’s projected profitability is 7% less than the market’s one and
3% less than the pharmaceutical industry’s one.![LiteForex: Introduction
to Pfizer, latest [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) and multipliers. Technical analysis. Actual
scenarios of price movements][4]

The company’s operating expenses haven’t been evolving either, located
in the range of 4.5 - 7.5 billion USD. At the same time, the company
strives to [optimize](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/17/added-genetic-algorithm-for-trading/) costs.

![LiteForex: Introduction to Pfizer, latest [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) and multipliers.
Technical analysis. Actual scenarios of price movements][5]

In the chart above we see that  [Pfizer][1] is having another wave of
jobs cuts. This fact is generally considered as positive, but it’s
unlikely to be much influential because mass production of coronavirus
vaccines may demand a bigger staff soon. ![LiteForex: Introduction to
Pfizer, latest [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) and multipliers. Technical analysis. Actual
scenarios of price movements][6]

One of the few multipliers that points to [Pfizer][1]’s stable evolution
is Debt to Asset ratio. We see that this indicator has been constantly
growing. It means the balance is in the negative zone and the debt
amount is growing against the company’s assets. This situation is
dangerous, and even more so because the free cash flow is constantly
falling.

![LiteForex: Introduction to Pfizer, latest [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) and multipliers.
Technical analysis. Actual scenarios of price movements][7]

The chart above shows that the company’s Free Cash Flow is at the level
of 2010 based on the latest data. Still, I’d like to note that the
situation remains stable. The company’s short-term liabilities are
covered by the transaction flow while current EBIT covers current
payments more than 12 times.

One of [Pfizer][1]’s strong advantages is a good dividend [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/). The
company has been sharing profits with its shareholders for more than 10
years, with over 50% of profits allocated for dividend payments.

Technical analysis. Actual scenarios of price movements][8]

Also, the [Dividends per share][1] value is higher than the average
market one and it equals 3.9 % on a relative basis or 0.38 USD in
absolute [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/). It grows every year.

### Comparison of Pfizer with Pfizer G35

![LiteForex: Introduction to Pfizer, latest [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) and multipliers.
Technical analysis. Actual scenarios of price movements][9]

Another interesting subject for analysis is [Pfizer][1]’s stock
evolution relative to its price in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of the 1971 Gold standard. This
analysis method has been described at length [here][10]. We see that
these two values are much different in the chart above. The red chart
which displays the actual evolution of [PFE ][1] stock is bullish. The
quotes are moving in a wide channel with a slight upward inclination.
But PFE G35 is in a local bearish channel. The blue chart touched the
support level at  the 2009 peak. If the descending channel is broken
from below, it will be a good bullish signal to buy.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis above, we can say that [Pfizer inc][1] has been
stagnating since 2016. The pharmaceutical market is competitive enough,
so the company is losing out to more mobile competitors because of its
large  scale and high operating expenses. [Pfizer][1] may be interesting
in the long term because of its high interest rate, but the company
lacks for a new best-seller for breakthrough growth. New covid vaccine
deals will make the company good profits in the short term, but they
won’t be too large given a high price competence: the global interest
and number of competitors working on the same problem is really high.
Still, [Pfizer][1]’s share fair price is estimated as 76 USD, which is 2
times more than the current value.

Now let’s analyse these estimations from a technical point of view.

Wave structure analysis

![LiteForex: Introduction to Pfizer, latest [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) and multipliers.
Technical analysis. Actual scenarios of price movements][11]

We begin with analysis of super cycles, as usual.

[Pfizer][1]’s 50-year [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) is displayed in the 2-month chart above.
The strongest growth wave lasted from the 60s and up to the 00s. Then a
strong downward correction begins. The bottom of this correction touches
and pulls back from 0,232 fibonacci of the previous growth wave. It’s a
good bullish signal from the fractal analysis theory, which confirms the
idea of bullish impulse itself. Thus, the bearish wave 2000-2008 is the
second wave in the whole wave structure.

![LiteForex: Introduction to Pfizer, latest [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) and multipliers.
Technical analysis. Actual scenarios of price movements][12]

So, one of the most probable global scenarios of the wave structure is a
5-wave impulse with a peak at around 100 USD per 1 [PFE ][1] share
(check the chart above).  According to this hypothesis, we’re in the
third wave of the super cycle. Our next forecasts for these stocks will
be based on this hypothesis and checked for compliance or non-compliance
with it.

![LiteForex: Introduction to Pfizer, latest [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) and multipliers.
Technical analysis. Actual scenarios of price movements][13]

Moving to the next level of the wave structure, we may suppose that most
probably the price is in the second sub-wave of the third wave in the
super cycle (check the blue pattern above). Why is it the second sub-
wave and not the inner correction of the first wave?

The thing is, the ultimate fall wave is too deep to be read as an inner
correction of the first sub-wave in the blue pattern, but it can be
easily read as a correction inside the second sub-wave. What’s more, the
current estimated peak of the first sub-wave coincides technically with
the first peak of the super cycle’s wave, which is a technically
beautiful pivot point.

![LiteForex: Introduction to Pfizer, latest [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) and multipliers.
Technical analysis. Actual scenarios of price movements][14]

When having a closer look at the correction’s depth, we see that the
estimated second wave almost reached the ideal pivot point at 0.382 of
the first wave, based on wave ratios. However, the current candlestick
is far from closing. There’s still some room for correction to 20 USD or
0.232 fib of the first wave. So, our task is to determine the second
wave’s potential pivot point and the pivot point of this year’s
candlestick.

![LiteForex: Introduction to Pfizer, latest [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) and multipliers.
Technical analysis. Actual scenarios of price movements][15]

On a monthly chart we see an almost perfect zigzag in the second wave
(green wave structure) where sub-wave (a) retraced from 0.618 fib of the
fifth sub-wave marked with a red arrow. Sub-wave (b)’s retracement from
nearby 0.5 fib of sub-wave (a) was technical too (marked with a green
arrow).

![LiteForex: Introduction to Pfizer, latest [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) and multipliers.
Technical analysis. Actual scenarios of price movements][16]

Based on this logic, the sub-wave (c) in the green structure must end at
around 1.618 of sub-wave (a) at the level of 20.91. At the same time,
0.618 fib of the first wave is about 24 USD. These levels belong to the
traded area of 20-28 USD, so the estimated pivot point of the second
wave may be located somewhere between those values. The value of 23.25
USD may be taken as an average one. So, according to wave analysis,
correction is likely to continue. It means the second wave hasn’t formed
fully yet.

![LiteForex: Introduction to Pfizer, latest [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) and multipliers.
Technical analysis. Actual scenarios of price movements][17]

This scenario should be cancelled when the line of 41USD is crossed from
below. If it happens, the minimums won’t be updated. Then we will have
either a flat correction, which is a rare thing in the second wave, or a
start of a new impulse structure in the third wave of the blue pattern
(see the level marked with a red cross).

![LiteForex: Introduction to Pfizer, latest [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) and multipliers.
Technical analysis. Actual scenarios of price movements][18]

On the weekly chart, wave (c) is developing as an ascending triangle,
which doesn’t normally happen in a zigzag.  Since such patterns as a
triangle can’t be forming in wave c in a zigzag, we may suppose that
corrective wave (2) finished forming at 28 USD. Thus, the first sub-wave
is developing in the third wave in the blue pattern at the
moment.![LiteForex: Introduction to Pfizer, latest [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) and multipliers.
Technical analysis. Actual scenarios of price movements][19]

Diagonal triangles normally form in first waves, so the current
formation is likely to look like it’s shown in the chart above. The peak
of this formation is at 41 USD. From here, a correction is likely to
form as a zigzag in the second sub-wave of the green structure.

### Analysis of indicators and candlestick protections

### ![LiteForex: Introduction to Pfizer, latest [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) and multipliers.
Technical analysis. Actual scenarios of price movements][20]

Now let’s have a look at other technical indicators. In the chart above
there are several signals for a probable slight correction within a
growing impulse:

  * MACD bearish divergence
  * Doji formation on growing volumes. It means bears are burnt out and sellers’ positions are strong at the current levels.
  * Price dropping below the candlestick projection (grey rectangle) makes the tolerance zone a strong resistance zone for bulls. The upper limit of this zone coincides with peak at 41 USD. 

So, we are very likely to see a correction which will close the third
wave of this formation and confirm a triangle automatically, because
it’s the only situation where the third wave may be shorter than the
first one.

### Long-term trading plan

### ![LiteForex: Introduction to Pfizer, latest [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) and multipliers.
Technical analysis. Actual scenarios of price movements][21]

[Pfizer][1] has everything for reaching long-term investment goals: a
good dividend [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) and reliable fundamental and economic indicators.
The company’s huge scales make it hard for its stocks to grow, but they
may double or even treble in the next 10 years based on the structure of
big super cycles. Thus, these stocks suit for both growth and dividend
portfolios in the long term from the current levels. A psychologically
important level is at around 100 USD per share.

### Medium-term trading plan

### ![LiteForex: Introduction to Pfizer, latest [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) and multipliers.
Technical analysis. Actual scenarios of price movements][22]

Investing in Pfizer for 1 year, don’t expect any outstanding
performance: the stocks will be under pressure of macro-economic
factors, such as economic crisis, US elections and tense relations with
China. [Pfizer][1] stocks are likely to be moving in a range of 41-28
USD next year. So, set alerts near these limits and buy either after a
retracement from the lower limit or after a breakout of the upper limit.
Remember that consolidation will most likely happen in an ascending
channel, so the lower limit needs to be revised and adjusted from time
to time.

### Short-term trading plan

### ![LiteForex: Introduction to Pfizer, latest [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) and multipliers.
Technical analysis. Actual scenarios of price movements][23]

When it comes to a short-term scenario, short positions look like the
most likely trading plan. They can be opened quite safely at 38.45 USD
with a target of 35. If we’re lucky, the stocks may fall to 33-34 USD.
Stops should be placed above the current local maximum of 39.42 USD. At
the same time, remember to observe your risk management and trading
strategies. I don’t recommend using a big leverage and allowing the risk
of loss to reach more than 3%. You can buy Pfizer [shares][1] here at
