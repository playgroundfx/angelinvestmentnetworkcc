Forecast for XAG/USD: Silver is given the green lightDmitri Demidenko

## Fundamental forecast for silver for today

### Increased investments in environmental ("green") projects will
contribute to the XAG/USD growth

The weakness of the US dollar, rising geopolitical tensions, falling
real interest rates of the global debt market, and massive monetary
stimulus from the world's leading central banks have allowed silver to
meet the $23 per ounce target I set [in June][1] much earlier than one
might have thought. Over the month, the [XAG/USD][2] quotes jumped more
than 40%, but the rally turned out to be so rapid that buyers decided to
take profit. Moreover, there is a reason for that - the Fed meeting.

As I noted [in July][3], silver has two growth drivers: investment and
industrial demand, which allows it to outpace gold during the recovery
phase of the global economy. Citigroup notes that silver shows its best
results when there is interest in an asset that protects wealth from
inflation, and economic activity gradually returns to the trend. The
company predicts the metal will rise to $30 per ounce in 12 months.

Stocks of silver [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/)s have increased by 35% to 820 million ounces since
the beginning of the year, and gold [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/)s have increased by 26%,
according to Eikon. Most likely, this trend will continue in the third
quarter, which allows the Silver Institute to predict a drop in the
Gold/Silver cross rate to 90. In March, the figure exceeded 120, while
its average value over the past decade has been 69.

### Gold/Silver cross rate dynamics

In my opinion, the long-term prospects for silver look better than those
of the leader of the precious metals sector. According to research by
RBC Capital Markets, its share of industrial use in total demand is 55%,
while increased investments in environmental projects will contribute to
the growth of consumption. BMO Capital Markets notes that in 2020,
governments spent more than $50 billion on these goals, and Joe Biden's
intention to ensure that the US energy sector stops polluting the
environment by 2035 could catalyze the [XAG/USD][2] rally. I would not
be surprised if the growing ratings of the Democrat inspire the bulls to
attack.

I [noted][3] that one of the factors behind the growth of silver is the
difficult epidemiological situation in the silver-producing countries.
The Silver Institute seems to agree with me, which predicts a 9%
reduction in silver production in 2020. Perhaps the [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s who missed
the gold rally will look for [XAG/USD][2] buying opportunities in the
hope that silver can also rewrite [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) highs.

The reasons for the current correction should be sought not only in
profit-taking but also in fears that the excessively gloomy rhetoric of
the Fed at the July 28-29 meeting will provoke a pullback in the S&P 500
and make the US dollar interesting as a safe-haven asset again. In my
opinion, Jerome Powell will not make the same mistake as in late 2018,
when a few of his incautious phrases drowned the stock index. In this
regard, the pullback of silver is a great opportunity to form longs with
targets at $27.5 and $28.5 per ounce. The combined strategy of selling
gold and buying silver with the target at 80 for Gold/Silver (XAU/XAG)
cross rate looks attractive.
