An ascending impulse wave A continues forming. The structure of its
ultimate segment is shown in the chart.  A sideways corrective wave [4]
formed as a contracting horizontal triangle (a)-(b)-(c)-(d)-(e). Then
the market started moving upwards, forming a bullish impulse wave [5].
Impulse (3) and a small correction (4) may finish in the nearest future.
Then wave (5) may complete the ascending trend at around 12,200.00.

Once a descending double zigzag W-X-Y formed, the pair started growing
in a new impulse wave. The ascending impulse 1 was completed, as well as
its corrective wave 2, formed as a bearish double zigzag [w]-[x]-[y].
An impulse wave 3 is forming now. It consists of sub-waves
[1]-[2]-[3]-[4]-[5]. Four out of its 5 parts look completed, so the
price is expected to rise in wave [5] to 0.250 in the nearest future.

A big impulse wave A is developing at the moment. Inside it, there
formed a long sideways corrective wave [4] in the form of a triple three
pattern. We are currently in a bullish impulse [5]. The first three
parts of this impulse look fully completed. So, in the nearest time the
market is expected to rise in the final wave (5) to a level of 360.00
after a slight decline in correction (4).
