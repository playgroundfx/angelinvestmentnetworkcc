Economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the week 20.04.2020 – 26.04.2020Jana Kane

##  **Overview of the main events of the Forex economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the
next trading week 20.04.2020 to 26.04.2020**

 **Trading on key Forex [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/): we are expecting the publication of
important macro statistics from the UK, Germany, Canada, the Eurozone,
the US, as well as the results of the meeting of the People’s Bank of
China at which the interest rate will be decided on.**

By the end of last week, the dollar strengthened despite the fact that
the demand for safe haven assets decreased slightly, and [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) risk
appetite increased. Gold quotes fell last Friday, returning to opening
levels at the beginning of the week near $1,687.00 per ounce.

The US President Trump announced a plan to gradually restart the
country's economy, and the American company Gilead Sciences announced
that its experimental drug showed good results in clinical trials in
patients with Covid-19.

"We need a working economy, we want to return it to this state very,
very quickly," Trump told media representatives last Thursday, although
he did not indicate a timetable for the resumption of normal rates of
activity. He encouraged each state to make this decision based on
available data.

The initial shock from the coronavirus has passed, however, until there
is more clarity regarding the ultimate impact of the pandemic on
economic activity, markets are likely to remain volatile. Investors
still have little faith that the worst for markets is over.

Meanwhile, oil continued to decline. The price of a barrel of WTI crude
oil fell on Friday to its lowest level in the past 18 years near 17.30
dollars.

The focus of traders next week will be on the publication of important
macro statistics from the UK, Germany, Canada, the Eurozone, and the US.
Investors will also pay attention to the meeting of the People’s Bank of
China, where a decision will be made on the interest rate.

 _ **Traders should pay attention to the following significant
macroeconomic data expected next week:**_

 *** during the coming week new events may be added to the [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) and
scheduled events may be canceled**

###  **22:45 NZD CPI (Consumer Price Index) for the 1st quarter**

Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a key indicator for assessing inflation
that reflects the dynamics of retail prices for a group of goods and
services that are part of the consumer basket. A positive result
strengthens the NZD, a negative result weakens it. Forecast: +0.3%
(versus +0.5% in the 4th quarter, +0.7% in the 3rd quarter). A relative
decrease in the indicator can negatively affect the NZD quotes. In
annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/), CPI grew in the 1st quarter by +1.8% (versus +1.9% in the
4th quarter, +1.5% in the 3rd quarter). Data worse than forecast will
negatively affect the NZD.

###  **Monday, April 20**

###  **01:30 CNY Bank of China's interest rate decision**

Since May 2012, the People’s Bank of China has been steadily lowering
the interest rate to support Chinese manufacturers. Last time in 2019,
the bank lowered the rate by 0.05% in November, and once again in
February 2020. Currently, the interest rate is at 4.05%.

In recent months, in the context of international trade conflicts and a
slowdown in the global economy, the world's largest central banks are
moving towards easing their monetary policies in order to support
national economies and increase the competitiveness of goods exported
from these countries.

The People's Bank of China is also in line with this process. The
depreciation of the yuan has become particularly relevant in the past 2
years, when the confrontation between the two most powerful economies in
the world began. One of the measures to mitigate the negative
consequences of increased duties on the import of Chinese goods into the
United States was the depreciation of the national currency of China.
This measure was supposed, among other things, to maintain the previous
volume of imports of Chinese products to the United States, which would
cost American buyers cheaper due to the difference in the exchange rates
of national currencies of the United States and China.

Now, another strong negative factor has been added to this -
coronavirus.

It is likely that at its meeting on Monday, the People’s Bank of China
will keep the interest rate at the same level of 4.05%, although a
reduction in the rate is also possible.

However, if the People's Bank of China makes unexpected statements or
decisions, volatility may increase in the entire financial market.
Investors will also be interested in the bank’s assessment of the
consequences of coronavirus for the Chinese economy and its [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) in
the near future in this regard.

###  **Tuesday, April 21**

###  **01:30 AUD Minutes of the last meeting of the Republic of
Australia**

This document is published two weeks after the meeting and the decision
on the interest rate. If the RBA positively assesses the state of the
labor market in the country, the GDP growth rate, and also shows a
hawkish attitude towards the inflation forecast in the economy, the
markets regard this as a higher probability of a rate increase at the
next meeting, which is a positive factor for the AUD. The bank’s soft
rhetoric regarding, above all, inflation puts pressure on the AUD.

At the meeting on April 7, the central bank kept its current monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) unchanged. The key interest rate of the RBA was kept at a record
low level of 0.25%, and the target level of yield on 3-year government
bonds was also left at 0.25%. The decision to lower the rate and
determine the current target level of government bond yields was made at
the previous unscheduled meeting of the RBA on March 19 in order to
support Australian businesses and citizens amid the rapid spread of the
coronavirus pandemic. The government was also forced to introduce a
social distancing regime, suspend enterprises and close borders for
international traffic.

According to many economists, Australia is on the verge of the first
economic recession in 30 years.

“Substantial uncertainty remains regarding the short-term prospects of
the Australian economy. In April-June, a very strong reduction in GDP is
expected, as well as unemployment growth to a multi-year maximum," said
RBA manager Philip Lowe after a bank meeting on April 7, adding that
"the board will not raise rates until there is progress in ensuring full
employment and appears confidence in inflation stabilization in the
target range of 2-3%.” In his opinion, “there are no serious arguments
in favor of tightening monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) in the short term,” and “it will
be some time before we increase interest rates.”

Nevertheless, if the published minutes contain unexpected information
regarding RBA's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) issues, the volatility in the AUD quotes
will increase.

###  **05:00 AUD Speech by the RBA Head Philip Lowe**

In his speech, Philip Lowe will assess the current situation in the
Australian economy and indicate further plans for the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of
the department. Any signals from him regarding the change in the plans
of the RBA's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) will cause a sharp increase in volatility
in the AUD trading and in the Australian stock market. If he does not
touch on the topic of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), then the reaction of the market
to his speech will be weak.

Market participants would also like to hear Lowe's opinion on central
bank [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) in the context of the ongoing pandemic of the coronavirus
and the threat of recession in Australia's economy, the first in 30
years.

“Substantial uncertainty remains regarding the short-term prospects of
the Australian economy. In April-June, a very strong decline in GDP is
expected, as well as an increase in unemployment to a multi-year high,”
said Philip Lowe after the central bank maintained its current monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) unchanged in early April. The key interest rate of the RBA was
kept at a record low level of 0.25%, and the target level of yield on
3-year government bonds was also left at 0.25%. The decision to lower
the rate and determine the current target level of government bond
yields was made at an unscheduled meeting of the RBA on March 19 in
order to support businesses and Australian citizens amid the rapid
spread of the coronavirus pandemic.

###  **06:00 GBP Report on the average salary of the British citizens
over the past 3 months. Unemployment rate**

Every month, the UK Office for National Statistics (ONS) publishes a
report on average earnings, including a period for the last 3 months,
with and without bonuses.

This report is a key short-term indicator of the dynamics of changes in
the level of wages of employees in the UK. Wages growth is a positive
factor for the GBP, and a low indicator value is negative. Forecast: the
April report suggests that the average wages with bonuses have increased
over the last 3 months (December-February) by 3.0% (against +3.1%,
+2.9%, +3.2% , +3.2%, +3.6%, 3.7%, +4.0%, +3.7% and +3.9% in previous
periods); without bonuses - by 3.2% (against +3.1%, +3.2%, +3.4%, +3.5%,
+3.6%, +3.8%, +3.8 %, +3.9% and +3.6% in previous periods). This is
still positive data despite the fact that they are below the average
values. If the data are better than expected, the pound is likely to
strengthen in the foreign exchange market.

Also at this time the office publishes data on unemployment in the UK.
Over the 3 months from December to February, unemployment is expected to
be at 3.8% (against 3.9% and 3.8% in previous periods). Since 2012, the
UK unemployment rate has been steadily declining (from 8.0% in September
2012). This is a positive factor for the pound.

If the data from the UK labor market turn out to be worse than the
forecast and / or the previous value, then the pound will be under
pressure.

In any case, at the time of publication of data from the British labor
market, volatility in pound quotes and the London Stock Exchange is
expected to increase.

###  **09:00 EUR ZEW Institute Business Sentiment Index in Germany**

This index reflects the difference between the share of optimistic and
pessimistic [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s, thus assessing the mood of [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s and
business. The growth of the indicator and its positive value indicate an
optimistic attitude of [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s, which is a bullish factor for the EUR.
Vice versa, a decrease in the indicator and its negative value is a
negative factor for the EUR. In February, the indicator value was 8.7
(against 26.7 in January, 10.7 in December), and in March -49.5 (with a
forecast of -23.4). Forecast: the indicator reading for April will be
-43, which is likely to have a negative impact on the euro. If the data
turn out to be worse than the forecast, the euro will decline even more
significantly.

###  **12:30** **CAD Retail Sales Index**

Retail Sales Index is published monthly by Statistics Canada and
estimates total retail sales. The index is often considered an indicator
of consumer confidence and reflects the state of the retail sector in
the near future. Index growth is usually a positive factor for the CAD;
a decrease in the indicator will negatively affect the CAD. Previous
index value (for January): 0.4%. If the data for February is weaker than
the forecast (according to the forecast, zero growth in retail sales is
expected), the CAD may drop sharply in the short term.

###  **Wednesday, April 22**

###  **06:00 GBP Consumer Price Index. Core Consumer Price Index**

Consumer Price Index (CPI) reflects the dynamics of retail prices for a
group of goods and services that are part of the British consumer
basket. CPI is a key indicator of inflation. Its publication will cause
major movement of the pound in the foreign exchange market, as well as
the London Stock Exchange Index FTSE100.

In the previous reporting month (in February), consumer inflation (in
annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) grew by 1.7% (against 1.8% in January).

Forecast for March: +1.7% (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)). This value is unlikely to
support the pound. An indicator below the forecast may trigger a
weakening of the pound, as low inflation will force the Bank of England
to maintain a soft monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).

Core Consumer Price Index (Core CPI) is published by the Office for
National Statistics and determines the change in prices of a selected
basket of goods and services (except food and energy) for a given
period. It is a key indicator for assessing inflation and changing
consumer preferences. A positive result strengthens the GBP, a negative
result weakens it.

In January, Core CPI (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) grew by +1.6%, and in February -
by +1.7%. It is likely that the publication of the indicator will
positively affect the pound if its value is higher than the forecast and
the previous value. Forecast for March: +1.5% (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)). An
indicator below the forecast and / or previous values ​​can trigger a
weakening of the pound.

###  **12:30 CAD Consumer Price Indices in Canada**

The Bank of Canada's Core Consumer Price Index (Core CPI) reflects the
dynamics of retail prices for the corresponding basket of goods and
services (excluding fruits, vegetables, gasoline, fuel oil, natural gas,
mortgage interest, intercity transport, and tobacco products). The
target inflation rate for the Bank of Canada is in the range of 1-3%.
The increase in CPI is a harbinger of a rate increase and a positive
factor for the CAD. Consumer prices in January rose by +0.3% (+2.4% in
annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)), and in February - by +0.4% (+2.2% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)). Core
Consumer Price Index rose in February by +0.7% (+1.8% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)).
If the March data turns out to be worse than the previous values, then
this will negatively affect the CAD. Data is better than expected and
above the previous values ​​will strengthen the Canadian dollar.

Forecast for March: Consumer Price Index will come out with a value of
+2.1% (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)). Core CPI is expected to rise by +1.8% in March.

###  **Thursday, April 23**

###  **07:30 EUR Manufacturing PMI of the German economy according to
Markit Economics (preliminary release). Composite PMI of the German
economy according to Markit Economics (preliminary release)**

Manufacturing PMI of the German economy is an important indicator of the
business environment and general economic situation in Germany. This
sector of the economy forms a significant part of German GDP. A result
above 50 is seen as positive and strengthens the EUR, below 50 - as
negative for the euro. Forecast for April (preliminary release): 39.6.

Previous values: 45.4 (with a forecast of 49.4) in March, 48 in
February, 45.3 in January, which indicates a slowdown in business
activity in this sector of the German economy. The growth of the
indicator above the previous value may support the euro (in the short
term), although its value is still below the value of 50. Data worse
than the forecast will have a negative impact on the euro.

Composite PMI of the German economy is an important indicator of the
business environment and general state of the German economy. A result
above 50 is seen as positive and strengthens the EUR, below 50 - as
negative for the euro. Forecast for April (preliminary release): 40.6
against 35 (with a forecast of 50.7) in March, 50.7 in February, 51.2 in
January, 50.2 in December. The publication of this indicator with the
indicated expected value of 40.6 is unlikely to support the euro. Data
is worse than forecast and below 50.0 will have a negative impact on the
euro.

###  **08:00 EUR Composite manufacturing PMI of the Eurozone economy
according to Markit Economics (preliminary release)**

Eurozone's PMI is an important indicator of the state of the entire
European economy. A result above 50 is seen as positive and strengthens
the EUR, below 50 - as negative for the euro. Forecast for April
(preliminary release): 38.8 against 29.7 (with a forecast of 51.0) in
March, 51.6 in February, 51.3 in January, which is unlikely to have a
positive impact on the euro, even despite the relative growth. If the
data turn out to be worse than the forecast and below the value of 50,
the euro may shortly but sharply decline.

###  **08:30 GBP UK's Services PMI according to Markit Economics
(preliminary release)**

PMI in the UK services sector is an important indicator of the state of
the British economy, although the service sector does not have such a
strong impact on the country's GDP as PMI in the manufacturing sector.

If the data turn out to be worse than the forecast and the previous
value, the pound will most likely sharply decrease in the short term.
Data better than forecast and the previous value will have a positive
impact on the pound. At the same time, a result above 50 is considered
positive and strengthens the GBP, below 50 - as negative for the GBP.

Previous indicator values: 34.5 in March, 53.2 in February, 53.9 in
January.

###  **12:30 USD Initial jobless claims in the US over the past week**

The situation on the country's labor market continues to deteriorate
rapidly. Back in February, the indicator of initial claims for
unemployment benefits was within its average values ​​of 193-252
thousand. However, then the situation began to deteriorate sharply. 4
weeks ago, the indicator rose to 3,283,000. In the week of March 22-28,
6.9 million claims were submitted, then 6.606 million claims, shocking
the observers and market participants. A similar indicator published
last Thursday (for the week of April 5-11) came out with a value of
5.245 million claims.

According to economists, the American economy has already lost more than
20 million jobs, which is more than either during the global financial
crisis or during the Great Depression of the 30s of the last century.
Every 1.5 million initial applications increase the unemployment rate by
1 percentage point. This means that 4 weeks with initial applications of
5-6 million can raise unemployment above 20%.

Economists blame the coronavirus, which has hit the US economy. Many US
companies announces layoffs, and authorities ordered non-vital companies
to close their offices and stores due to the coronavirus epidemic.
Eventually, the weekly growth rate of applications far exceeded the
previous record level of 695,000 reached in October 1982. Then the
number of initial claims filed in four weeks amounted to 2.7 million.
From March 29 to April 4, 2020, unemployment 12 million Americans
received benefits, which also became a new record. The previous record
was set a week earlier when 7.4 million people received benefits - the
highest since the recession of 2007-2009.

This indicator reflects the state of the labor market. An increase in
value negatively affects consumption and economic growth. Under normal
conditions, a high result weakens the US dollar, while a low one
strengthens it. However, in the current environment (the coronavirus
pandemic and a sharp economic slowdown), the reaction of market
participants to the publication of this report by the US Department of
Labor can be completely unpredictable.

###  **Friday, April 24**

###  **12:30 USD Orders for capital goods (excluding defense and
aviation)**

The indicator reflects the value of orders received by manufacturers of
capital goods (capital goods are commodities used for the production of
durable goods and services) involving large investments. Goods
manufactured in the defense and aviation sectors of the US economy are
not included in this indicator. A high result strengthens the USD.
Previous indicator values: -0.9% (in February), + 1.0% (in January),
-0.5% (in December). Forecast for March: -0.4%. Theoretically, the
relative growth of the indicator has a positive effect on the dollar.
However, the reaction of the market to its negative value may be
negative for the dollar in the short term. Data worse than the previous
value and forecast will also negatively affect dollar quotes.
