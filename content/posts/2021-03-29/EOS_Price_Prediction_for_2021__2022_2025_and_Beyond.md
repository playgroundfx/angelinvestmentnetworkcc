EOS Price Prediction for 2021, 2022-2025 and BeyondJana Kane

Becoming a cryptocurrency [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) may be confusing, even for
experienced traders, let alone novel ones who are just becoming
acquainted with this evolving asset class and Blockchain technology.
Just like with regular trading, to master the art of [cryptotrading][1],
the most important thing is to have a good understanding of [how to](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-trading-how-to/)
predict prices. Everyone’s heard about the big players like Ethereum and
Bitcoin. In this article, however, we’ll discuss EOS.

The article covers the following subjects:

This article will answer the most frequently asked questions about EOS,
cover its [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/), and show you EOS price predictions from the crypto
industry experts, as well as long-term forecasts of the coin. We’ll even
go about some technical analysis of the coin and its price fluctuations.

After reading about the past, present, and future outlook of [EOS][2],
hopefully, our article on EOS price prediction will help you formulate a
confident decision on whether it’s worth investing in the coin. Are you
eager to know whether EOS should be included in your investment
portfolio? Read on to learn about all the important aspects.

## What is EOS Crypto?

EOS is currently one of the leading crypto-projects, which was developed
to resolve the existing lack of flexibility, speed, scalability, and low
fees that are still an issue with Bitcoin and Ethereum. EOS operates on
its own [smart contract](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/smart-contract-on-blockchain/) platform for decentralized applications (dApps):
the EOS.IO [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) protocol, designed especially as a solution to
outperform regular processing and hardware storage, and much more
interesting stuff.

Back in 2017, EOS developers Brendan Blumer and Dan Larimer publicly
released their whitepaper, and the first EOS initial coin offering (ICO)
launched in June of the same year. It lasted an entire year and raised a
whopping $4.1 billion – breaking all ICO records at the time.

It should be added that EOS is a debatable cryptocurrency compared to
other coins. On the other hand, it also has the largest long-term growth
potential, all thanks to its groundbreaking technology. The EOS
[blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) protocol can potentially transform the future of all Apps and
computer resources drastically, in case it does refine the internal
processes in various industries, as promised by EOS’ developers. If so,
the coin’s long-term price will rise rapidly.

## EOS Today and in History

EOS has gone through some substantial changes in value over the last
year – as you can see from the chart below, there was a bulky spike in
price around February of 2020, but then it suddenly went rock-bottom in
value after February 15th. Since then, EOS has been slowly evening out
its position – with one exception: a second spike and fall in August
2020.

 _Source: Coinmarketcap_

Throughout 2020, EOS reached an all-time high value of $5.36 per token,
whereas its worst point this year was $1.86 per token. This gave traders
an excellent long opportunity as we are coming out of two years of
drawdown and a bearish market.

Based on Liteforex’s studies of EOS, along with the analysis of expert
opinions, this cryptocurrency asset is showing definite signs of being
on the threshold of a major collapse. In early September, a lot of
assets plummeted across the crypto trading market. While ETH and BTC
already made substantial progress towards undoing their downtrend, EOS
has yet to recover.

EOS hasn’t been able to extend its bullish achievement greater than $3
since [September’s drop][3]. EOS bulls seem to be tired by the recurrent
rebuffs caused by the 50 SMA. Besides, a downward triangle appears to
suggest that the EOS value may be headed towards $1.75. This descending
triangle pattern was formed in 2018 – so it’s in the process of being
done and done.

## EOS Price Predictions for 2021 by Crypto Experts

What’s interesting to note is that, despite the downward triangle
pattern, various prominent experts have different opinions about the
predicted price of EOS. Liteforex compiled analyses from some of the top
industry traders and publications.

### Brave New Coin

In a [video][4] posted on November 14th, 2020, the Blockchain and Crypto
Asset Market Data company notes that breaking away from the current
consolidation is crucial for EOS,  because it could give the market
players some confidence that the EOS will go higher. Currently, the
sentiment is more bearish than bullish.

A strong zone of resistance rests at $3.70 and $4.80-$5.90 with an
equally strong support level at $2.40-$2.92. Yearly pivot levels reflect
resistance at $4.50 and $6.75. This means it’s unlikely to grow higher
in the near future.

### Satis Group

In 2018, expert forecasters at [Satis Group][5] confirmed that Ethereum
is one of the few ventures that will be able to remain viable in the
[smart contract](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/smart-contract-on-blockchain/) niche. However, the Satis Group [forecasted a negative
result for EOS][6], with a bull's eye price of $3.6 USD in 2021.

### Margin Buu

Respected Trading View user, [Margin Buu][7], predicted that EOS would
[recoil][8] to around $2.6 and be led across the $2.8 mark in the near
future. Every day EOS stays above 2.60, it builds a more bullish case.
We had a long sideway period, and that usually ends in a new uptrend if
the market conditions are right.

### Mati Greenspan

[Mati Greenspan][9], a market analyst, believes that EOS is a thrilling
project and is one of the quickest-growing ecosystems in the industry of
crypto assets. [In a 2019 interview with Cryptoglobe][10], Mati
indicated that the total amount of developer activity for EOS is more
than any other form of crypto, obviously excluding ETH. However, when
asked whether he was more bearish or bullish, Greenspan commented that
he had reduced the share of EOS in his portfolio.

While experts are of different opinions on EOS, Liteforex is in favor of
the ones who take the downward triangle into account. It is exceedingly
hopeful to assume EOS is going to reach $100-$1000 in a couple of years.
Consequently, is it a good idea to buy EOS in 2020? It depends: are you
going for a long-term or a short-term strategy? If you’re going short-
term, you’d be better off purchasing cryptocurrencies that have
sufficiently recovered from September’s drop – like the good old BTC or
ETH, for example. Yet, if you are ready to hodl your EOS for a few years
to come, then, yes, now would be a great time to buy.

## EOS Technical Analysis

I will start the [EOSUSD][2] technical analysis by exploring the EOS
rate [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) data in the longest timeframe.

 ****

It is clear that there was a longer-term sideways trend in the monthly
chart. The latest candlestick suggests that there could start a new
trend.

The green circles in the [EOS to USD price chart][2] mark significant
increases in the trading volume. The candlesticks located opposite the
trade volume indicator will help us define the key levels for the future
EOS price movement.

For example, level 5.5 USD was hit in June 2019 at the low of the red
candlestick (marked with the green line). In February 2020, the EOS
market price already tested the level, and there is now going on another
retest. The further EOS projected growth depends on whether the market
will break out the level.

Another green level marks a relevant local high at 8.6 dollars. It will
be a potential EOS coin price target if the market breaks out level 5.5
USD.

The support level is at a level of around 1.5, marked with a red line.
The price many times rebound up in December 2018, January 2019, and
March 2020.

Another important level is at 2.2 USD. Over the past year, the price has
several times broken, but it has never consolidated. Levels 1.5 and 2.2
form a support zone, marked with the red area in the chart.

### EOS price prediction for next three months

 ****

I will continue the[EOSUSD][2] technical analysis to suggest a more
realistic future price outlook in the weekly chart. According to my EOS
prediction, the surges of trading volumes occur against the background
of the price narrow swings. It means the active struggle between bulls
and bears.

Besides, the EOS price rebound from level 5.5 means a likely side-ways
trend should start soon. Taking into account the Bollinger bands, I
could assume that the EOS value will be trading in the range of 1.6-4.5
over the next three months.

Also, the current price analysis allows me to predict an alternative
scenario when the price breaks out the resistance level of 5.5. If so,
the expected EOS price growth target will be a level of 8.5 USD.

However, the EOSUSD trade volume does not confirm the latter scenario.
Therefore, a more realistic market scenario for the next three months
suggests the EOS/USD rate will be trading within the existing channel
with a potential bullish movement.

### Monthly EOS price forecast for 2021

Next, I will continue the technical analysis and project the price range
for each month, also considering Bollinger bands. Below, I offer a
detailed long term EOS [cryptocurrency price](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/cryptocurrency-price/) forecast for 2021.

 ****

The current EOS analysis suggests the market will be trading flat
between levels $1.5-$2.2 and $5.5. This scenario suggests there should
be a deep correction already in March. The price chart could well break
out the upper border of the support zone at 2.2 and reach the level of
1.5.

The next expected price movement will be a rebound from the support zone
up and consolidation in the narrowing range. I suppose the[ EOS USD][2]
price will be trading in the range of 2.9–4.4 in October 2021. Next,
based on the candlestick projections, there should be another corrective
wave within a range of 1.7–3.2. If the price breaks out at key levels,
it will signal an emerging trend. This scenario will be canceled if the
market breaks out at level 5.5 USD. If so, the likely EOS price target
will be at 8.5 USD.

 The detailed [EOS][2] forecast for each month is in the table below.

The [EOSUSD][2] price technical analysis is presented by[ Mikhail
Hypov][11].

## Weekly Elliott wave EOS analysis as of 29.03.2021

The EOSUSD continues forming the global corrective down wave B as a
triple zigzag [W]-[X]-[Y]-[X]-[Z]. The last but one linking wave [X] may
have completed, and the market resumed declining in the final wave [Z].
Presumably, the [Z] wave should complete as a bearish double zigzag
(W)-(X)-(Y). Let us study its structure in more detail in a shorter
timeframe.

As it is clear from the most recent chart section, the zigzag-shaped
wave (W) has completed, and there is now developing the linking wave
(X). It should end as a double zigzag composed of the sub-waves W-X-Y.
The market should soon start rising in the final wave Y of the double
zigzag to a level of 4.68. While the price is rising, there could form
the zigzag-shapes pattern [A]-[B]-[C], as outlined in the chart. At
level 4.68, the corrective linking wave (X) will reach the 61.8%
Fibonacci ratio of wave (W).

### Weekly [EOSUSD][2] trading plan:

Buy 4.17, TP 4.68

 _[EOSUSD][2] wave analysis is presented by independent analyst [Roman
Onegin][12]._

## EOS Price Prediction Chart 2022

EOS doesn’t have a lot of [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) to analyze its price for reiterating
patterns; still, the asymmetrical triangle this asset has been trading
within for its complete lifespan was led by a prevailing growth. After a
true battle breakout signaling the culmination of a bear market, EOS
could experience another extremely powerful upward EOS trend, getting
closer to prices near $15 per EOS in 2022 (or even in late 2021).

## Long Term EOS Price Prediction 2023-2026

Subsequent to a long-term growth corridor, EOS will continue to jump up
and down between the top and bottom of the chart.

According to Digitalcoin, EOS should [reach $5.24 by the end of
2020][13], $6.56 by the end of 2021 (once again, both [EOS forecasts][2]
are similar), $7.74 for 2022, $9.35 for 2023, $10.69 for 2024, and
$11.86 for 2025. They’ve even made long-term predictions at $13.08 for
2026, but this is too far in the future to confidently forecast.
Ultimately, in the not-so-distant future during 2023, 2024, 2025, and
beyond, the coin could reach estimates as high as $500 per token.

### EOS: A Viable Long-Term Investment?

Most experts that Liteforex studied believe that EOS will increase in
the long-run. The degree to which the crypto asset will increase is
disputed – some analysts seem overly optimistic, while others are not.

Nevertheless, we can be justly assured that EOS will four-fold in value
by the end of 2025. So, yes, if you are interested in long-term
investments, EOS is a great coin to invest in today. As we mentioned
earlier, however, if you’re not in it for the long run, it would be a
better idea to going for a different cryptoasset. Again, all long-term
forecasts are very approximate and can be influenced by [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/), political
and economic [regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/)s, and other factors.

## How Has the Price of EOS Changed Over Time?

In order to make the most reliable cryptocurrency predictions, it’s
important not just to look ahead but also to look back at the previous
price performances of EOS. Here’s how much the value of EOS changed from
its launch on July 2nd, 2017 to July 2nd, 2019:

And here’s what some of the leading experts anticipate EOS prices being
between today and the end of 2021.

### What is the Future of EOS? Is EOS a good investment?

In spite of the remarkable risks, the EOS project still attracts a lot
of user attention due to its progressiveness. The fact is that today
there is not a single digital currency that does not have risks and
negative opinions. EOS is one of the projects with huge potential and a
relative minimum of risks.

There are already quite a few users who are considering the EOS system
as a direction for long-term investment. There are also specialists
involved in the analysis of rates and the execution of transactions
online. The cryptocurrency is quite capable of generating tangible
income, which attracts users.

EOS is a complex platform that implements the technical capabilities of
[blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) technology. This makes it possible to call the project not
just a cryptocurrency but also a detailed financial structure at the
same time.

Summing up the analysis of the [EOS][2] cryptocurrency project, it can
be argued that the platform is a complex and promising investment
option. The crypto is quite interesting and multifunctional, although
one cannot expect to receive huge profits. EOS is a relatively new
project and is undergoing an overall assessment, which translates into
uncertain value growth. It can be assumed that if the development team
continues to develop the system in a given direction and reaches at
least part of the stated goals, then the value of the coin will increase
significantly.

There is no need to wait for this in the near future, but there are
definitely prospects. EOS can become a pioneer in some areas of the
