Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 29.03.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

All three cryptocurrency pairs should be rising. Let us examine each
cryptocurrency market situation in more detail.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

The hourly BTCUSD chart shows that the market has finished developing
the down corrective wave 4 composed of the sub-waves [a]-[b]-[c]. Next,
the price has started rising in impulse wave 5. The sub-waves [1] and
[2] must have completed, and the bullish wave [3] is half-complete. Wave
[3] could end at a level of 59860.00, where the [b] correction finished.
The entire impulse wave 5 might end at a level of 65000.00, as outlined
in the chart.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 55458.50, TP 59860.00

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

The XRPUSD market continues forming the final wave (C) of the zigzag
(A)-(B)-(C). Wave (C) is an ending diagonal, with the first four legs
completed inside. There is now forming the final upward wave 5. There
should have completed the bullish impulse wave [a] and correction [b].
Therefore, the price should be rising in the final sub-wave [c]. The
first target for buy trades is at a level of 0.600. This is the high
made by the corrective wave 3.

## Elliott wave Ethereum analysis

The hourly ETHUSD price chart displays the structure of the upward wave
(5), unfolding as an ending diagonal 1-2-3-4-5. The bearish corrective
wave 4 has recently completed as a simple zigzag. There is now forming
the final zigzag-shaped wave 5. The price should be rising in sub-wave
(5) to a level of 1805.00, where the entire impulse wave [a] will
finish. Next, the price should decline slightly in the [b] correction,
as outlined in the chart.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:
