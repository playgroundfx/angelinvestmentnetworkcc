Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 29.03.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

Gold is trading in the sideways trend between the resistance level of
1745 and the support level of 1722.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

Last week, the Intermediary Zone 60.04 - 59.78 was broken out. Then the
price corrected to the new trend's key support 58.76 - 58.51. The WTI
oil price went up from the key support. Traders reached the resistance
level of 61.22.

Thus, on Monday morning, oil is trading in a short-term uptrend, the
target of which is the margin zone 62.84 - 62.33.

The border of the short-term uptrend is shifting to the levels 58.79 -
58.53. While the zone is being held, look for purchases.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

Open buy positions according to the pattern in 59.36 - 58.53.
TakeProfit: 61.87. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

Gold is trading in the sideways trend between the resistance level of
1745 and the support level of 1722. Now traders are trying to break out
the flat's lower border. If they succeed, the price will move to the
area around level 1700.

If the price does not break out the zone 1726 - 1722, it will rise to
the flat's upper border. The breakout of level 1745 will lead to a test
of level 1755. Consolidation of the price above level 1755 will allow
traders to reach the Target Zone 1786 - 1776.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

  1. Open buy positions according to the pattern in 1726 - 1722. TakeProfit: 1745. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. Sell when level 1722 is broken out. TakeProfit: 1700. StopLoss: beyond the local high.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

Last week the Target Zone 1.1830 - 1.1814 was broken out. The next
target within the short-term downtrend is the Gold Zone 1.1750 - 1.1742.

On Friday, the price corrected up to the Additional Zone 1.1806 -
1.1802. So far, this zone is the key resistance for today. If there is a
sell signal in the zone, one could consider entering a short trade with
the first target at 1.1763.

The breakout of the Additional Zone will allow prices to rise to the
trend border 1.1850 - 1.1842. This will allow opening a long trade with
a stop at 1.1778.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

  1. Sell according to the pattern in Additional Zone 1.1806 - 1.1802. TakeProfit: 1.1763. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. If the price breaks out Additional Zone 1.1806 - 1.1802, buy on retest. TakeProfit: Intermediary Zone 1.1850 - 1.1842. StopLoss: 1.1778.
