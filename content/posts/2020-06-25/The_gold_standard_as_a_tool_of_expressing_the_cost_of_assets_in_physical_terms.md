The gold standard as a tool for expressing the cost of assets in

## The gold standard as a tool for expressing the cost of assets in
physical [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)

I have already mentioned gold in my previous articles devoted to the
commodity market, which you can read [here][1] and [here][2]. This
article will be entirely focused on gold.

 **History of gold pricing**

Before the gold standard was abandoned in 1971, gold prices were kept
under control artificially. There were attempts of price fixing. In the
1960ies, there was an OPEC analogue called “the London gold pool”. In
the end, all those non-market instruments failed.  At that time, gold
was pegged to the dollar at USD 35 per ounce. Such a mechanism was
doomed to failure, but it was [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/)ly important: the 1944 Bretton
Woods agreements fixed the price of 1 ounce at 35 USD on the global
level. It simplified the process of international transactions. After
all, cheques are faster, cheaper and safer to transport than heavy gold
bullions. All the countries which signed the agreement calculated the
rate of their national currencies against the USD, which in its turn was
pegged to [gold][3]. Thus, the gold standard turned the USD into a
global currency. Besides gold, every state had to have dollar reserves
for global payments too.

On 15th August 1971, the US president Richard Nixon decides to abandon
the gold standard because of a high emission of dollars.  The US growing
economy demanded a huge amount of money. The gold standard became a
brake on economic growth and gave rise to an economic deflation. Many
still upbraid Nixon for that, but he didn’t have any choice actually.
The Bretton Woods agreement was officially terminated in 1978. However,
the US dollar had already become a foundation of the global economy and
a universal cost measure. Even if the Bretton Woods agreement was
terminated more than 40 years ago, its consequences are always
perceptible.

After the gold standard was given up, the gold price expressed in
dollars had nothing else to do but go up.  So, the whole world saw the
real cost of gold and the USD. The latter had already become a reserve
currency in all developed countries. And here comes the main insight I
want to share: current [gold][3] prices can be used as an indicator of
the modern USD’s devaluation relative to the USD of the gold standard
epoch. This insight is all the more so relevant now when dollars are
printed in an uncontrolled manner. Dividing an asset price by 1 ounce
price of the same period and multiplying it by 35, we’ll have the price
that would exist if the gold standard had been kept.

assets in physical [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)][5]

So, if we compare the dynamics of the [S&P500][6] index with its
dynamics relative to the gold standard, we see a growing deviation.
Following this logic, we see that the index used to reflect the real
economic state before the dot-com crisis. But the emission of dollars
proceeded to pump the bubble while the real cost of assets based on the
gold standard didn’t exceed the pre-crisis value of the early noughties.

 **Disadvantages of this method. Price forming factors**

This is a new kind of analysis at the intersection of fundamental and
technical analyses. Obviously, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s should be more interested in
assets which grow physically and not through money emissions or other
inflationary factors. Still, this approach is best applied in the long
term. The reason is internal factors of [gold][3] pricing.

Gold production is a costly process. Its average cost of 1 ounce
production is 240 USD. [Gold][3] quotes are at around 1,700 USD. Besides
traders, there are other factors which affect gold prices:

  1. Industrial demand for [gold][3]. Because the metal is actively used in microelectronics and production of high-precision equipment, its [price][3] depends on the state of these sectors.   Also, gold is stably demanded in chemical and light industries for gilding and producing gold-based materials.
  2. Jewellery. [Gold][3] is the main material here. [Gold][3] is particularly popular in Asia and India where jewellery made of pure gold is held in reverence. So, it’s necessary to consider a seasonal demand for jewellery in these regions associated with weddings and other festivities (autumn and spring).
  3. Store of value (bullions) or collecting (coins). Well-to-do families often buy gold for forming a personal gold reserve. This method implies additional expenses linked to storage, but it guarantees that money will be safe in a time of economic instability.
  4. Risk hedging. [Gold][3] futures are often used as a protection against crises and devaluation of national currencies. This factor becomes more important when stock indexes fall. I made a comparison of these indicators in my previous [article][2]. The regularity is that when blue chips’ prices drop, the demand for [gold][3] starts growing.

So, such a big number of unrelated factors creates a big volatility in
the medium and short term. Using the gold standard to assess an asset
will therefore be efficient on big time frames starting from 1 month. It
may produce false signals on small time frames though, because the price
is subject to many internal industry factors too.

My next article will explain [how to](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-trading-how-to/) analyse big time frames and which
signals to use. Also, I’ll provide my technical forecast for gold in the
long, medium and short term. Remember that you can trade [gold][3]
futures and [S&P500][6] with tightest spreads at LiteForex. If you
