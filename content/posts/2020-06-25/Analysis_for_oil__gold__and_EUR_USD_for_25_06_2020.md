Analysis for oil, gold, and EUR/USD for 25.06.2020Alex Rodiоnov

###  **USCrude – oil**

Oil price is being corrected down in the middle-term uptrend. The
correction target could be at the trend key support [33.64 – 32.86].
When the support is tested, I recommend entering new buy trades
according to the pattern.

![LiteForex: Analysis for oil, gold, and EUR/USD for 25.06.2020][1]

It is clear form the short-term chart that bears broke Additional Zone
[39.49 - 39.30] drew the price down to Intermediary Zone [37.54 – 37.15]
yesterday. IZ is the key support of the short-term uptrend, so it is
relevant to enter oil purchases today with the target at the high of
June 23.

If IZ is broken out downside, and the US session closes the price below
today, the local trend will turn down. If so, the sell target will be
the lower Target Zone [33.64 — 32.86].

![LiteForex: Analysis for oil, gold, and EUR/USD for 25.06.2020][2]

 **[USCrude][3]Trading ideas for today:  **

Buy according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone [37.54 - 37.15].
TakeProfit: 41.40. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

###  **XAUUSD – gold**

Gold traders try to consolidate the price above the May’s high and above
Target Zone 5 [1757.2 – 1751.2]. The price will consolidate after one
more US session closes gold above level 1765.5. If the buyers succeed,
the next upside target in TZ 6 [1817.2 – 1811.2] is likely to be
achieved.

Let us look at the shorter timeframe. Gold is trading in the short-term
uptrend. The price hasn’t yet broken out the resistance Target Zone
[1771.3 – 1762.2].

Today, the price has tested Additional Zone [1758.8 – 1756.8], a strong
intraday support. I recommend entering gold buy trades according to the
pattern with the target at yesterday’s high.

The border of the uptrend is in the zone of [1738.3 – 1734.2]. If this
zone is reached by the price, we shall look for buy entries.

 **[XAUUSD][6] Trading ideas for today:  **

  1. Buy according to the pattern in Additional Zone [1758.8 - 1756.8]. TakeProfit: 1778.5. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. Buy according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone [1738.3 - 1734.2]. TakeProfit: 1778.5. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

###  **EURUSD – euro/dollar**

The EURUSD is rolling down form the key resistance of the middle-term
downtrend [1.1368 – 1.1350]. When there is a sell pattern, we shall
enter sell trades with a target around the low of last week.

![LiteForex: Analysis for oil, gold, and EUR/USD for 25.06.2020][7]

The EUR/USD short-term trend is up. Traders are now testing the trend
key support [1.1257 - 1.1248]. Today, I suggest expecting a buy pattern
and entering purchases with the target at level 1.1350.

If bears break out IZ and the US session closes the price below, the
euro local trend will turn down. If so, we shall enter sell trades
tomorrow with the target at the lower Target Zone [1.1166 – 1.1148]. In
this case, both trends (short-term and middle-term) will go in sync.

![LiteForex: Analysis for oil, gold, and EUR/USD for 25.06.2020][8]

 **[EURUSD][9] Trading ideas for today:  **

Buy according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone [1.1257 - 1.1248].
TakeProfit: 1.1350. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

> IZ - Intermediary Zone: responsible for the price momentum reversing

>

> TZ - Target Zone: a zone that is 75% likely to be reached after IZ
breakout.

>

> GZ - Gold Zone: zone in the medium-term momentum.

>

> All zones are calculated based on the average [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) price of the
instrument and margin requirements of the futures.
