Best Forex Trading Indicators Every Trader Should UseOleg Tkachenko

This overview gives a general description of the top Forex indicators
suitable for [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s and traders: both newbies and professionals. In
this article, you will find indicators for scalping, intraday, and long-
term [trading strategies](https://www.fintechee.com/forex-trading-strategies/); for trending and flat markets. Each section
contains a link to the detailed description of the indicator with the
explanation of signals and examples of practical application.

The article covers the following subjects:

Technical indicators can be divided into two major groups:

  1.  **Custom Forex Indicators.** Custom indicators are original indicators written in the programming language by [individual trader](https://www.fintechee.com/services/individual-trader/)s. These technical tools are designed for specific tasks or individual trading systems. There are several thousands of [custom indicator](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/custom-indicator/)s, and every year there appear new tools or old versions are upgraded.
  2.  **Standard Forex Indicators.** Standard indicators are the basis of technical analysis. They are considered the best tools since standard indicators have been tested and brushed over several decades of application in the commodity, stock, and foreign exchange markets. Technical indicators are the basis for most beginner trader strategies, which are explained in textbooks, trader blogs, [tutorial](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/)s, etc. MT4 includes 30 standard indicators of technical analysis; MT5 – 38. There are more than 60 technical tools in the LiteForex terminal, and the developers constantly add new tools to the indicator list.

>  **Important!** After you read about an indicator, click on the link
and go to the full overview of the indicator and open the [Forex trading
chart with online indicators][1] at the same time. Try all indicators
you read about in practice. This way, you will better understand a tool
and learn [how to](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-trading-how-to/) spot signals visually.

## What is a Trading Indicator?

Technical analysis analyzes statistical trends gathered from trading
activity, such as price movement and volume, to forecast future price
movements and evaluate trading opportunities.

 **Components of technical analysis:**

  * Trading indicators. They are [algorithms](https://www.fintechee.com/algorithms-for-trading/) based on mathematical analysis and formulas, which calculate price values for a particular period. Based on these data, technical indicators project the average price in the future.
  * Levels, trend lines. These are strong levels where a correction could start, or the trend could reverse. These levels can also serve as the consolidation zone borders. Such levels also include support and resistance levels (S/R levels), which could be horizontal, diagonal, dynamic, and Fibonacci levels. The nature of the levels is also of a psychological nature, which is taken into account in forex predictions.
  * Patterns. These are recognizable price chart formations that often reoccur. There could be candlestick patterns also. Patterns usually signal either the continuation or the reversal of the trend.

An important element is also the mathematical analysis of the Forex
pattern.

Fundamental analysis is a method of forecasting future prices by
economic, financial, and political factors, [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/), force majeure.

 **Components of fundamental analysis:**

  * Macroeconomics. Economic indicators: interest rate, GDP, inflation, employment, industrial production, etc.
  * Microeconomics. Financial reports of individual companies, production level forecasts, new directions and developments, management, financial analysts’ opinions.
  * Geopolitical factors, force majeure, and so on.

As an example of fundamental factors, we can list US Non-Farm Payrolls,
Fed’s announcements, and the demand-and-supply ratio of a particular
asset. You can read more about Fundamental analysis [here][2].

The difference between technical and fundamental analysis is in the
principles and approach to forecasting. Technical analysis is built on
mathematical formulas, models, and a search for patterns in the past.
Fundamental analysis takes into account economic reports, [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/), etc.

### How Technical Analysis Indicators Work

Technical Analysis (TA) is applied to forecast the market trend, pivot
points, set stop loss, and take profit levels.

Technical analysis is based on a few principles:

  *  **The market is cyclic.** The economy develops according to the wave theory; there is a top and a bottom, there is an increase and a decline. Cycles could have different lengths, but the fundamental factors of each of the cycle stages allow predicting the future price trends.
  *  **Events repeat.** The consequences of these events also repeat. If you can find regularities, it is possible to predict the result in the future, based on the past.
  *  **Prices are affected by all factors.** Demand, economic data, expectations of the market participants – all these factors are already priced in the quotes of an asset.

Technical analysis is based on mathematical, statistical methods and the
search for patterns. Traders react typically to repetitive factors -
their behavior can be predicted based on statistics.

It is necessary to analyze mathematical and technical factors for
several reasons:

  * Using methods of mathematics and statistics, [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) data are analyzed. Regularities are found based on grouping and averaging. Mathematical and behavioral models are built to predict the future actions of the majority.
  * The use of mathematical [algorithms](https://www.fintechee.com/algorithms-for-trading/) allows you to filter out the price noise and determine the general, averaged values of trade volumes, amplitude, and frequency of price movements for particular periods.
  * Algorithms based on mathematical and statistical analysis generate signals to perform a particular market action: enter or exit a trade, place pending orders. The signal also indicates the overbought or oversold state of the market, allows you to measure the trend strength, and so on.

Based on technical indicators, Expert Advisors are developed, those
being [automated](https://www.fintechee.com/features/automated-forex-trading/) trading systems that enter trades according to the set
algorithm. Hedge funds are gradually introducing new trading systems
based on trained [neural network](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/17/added-genetic-algorithm-for-trading/)s, LSTM models that can find the most
favorable solution based on input statistics and the desired output.

## Trading Indicators Categories

Indicators come into two major categories, lagging and leading. Lagging
indicators compare the current price values with the previous period.
They send a signal when the trend has already started.

> Example. There should be an uptrend, as the current price is higher
than the highs over the last 15 candlesticks. A [Simple Moving Average](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/simple-moving-average.html) is
the average price for the last 15 candlesticks. The price change only at
the last candlestick compared with the previous 14 ones has little
effect on the MA reading. Therefore, the trend has already started, but
the MA doesn’t signal it. This is the lag, the indicator will signal a
new trend when it is already obvious.

Leading indicators change along with the price and, according to certain
criteria, can help predict further price movement.

Lagging indicators are conservative, they do not send early signals.
They are more accurate than the leading indicators. However, by the time
there is a signal, you could have missed half of the trend. Therefore,
lagging indicators are more often applied in longer timeframes starting
from H1 and longer. This way, even if you have missed some part of the
trend, you could still gain 20-50 pips or more. Leading indicators are
more efficient in short corrections or scalping.

Let us explore each category in more detail.

### Leading Indicators

Leading ****indicators are among the best technical indicators which
provide information on the trend, its strength, potential reversal
before the price confirms the signal. Leading indicators send an early
signal about the economic cycle.

Most oscillators are classified as leading indicators. If an oscillator
is near the borders of the trading range, the trend may reverse soon.
Conversely, if the oscillator left the border zone and went to the
opposite border, this is a likely signal for the beginning of a strong
trend.

Another early signal of Forex indicators is divergence. If the price
chart and the indicator go in the opposite directions, the price could
soon reverse, following the indicator.

### Lagging Indicators

Lagging indicators provide the information calculated based on the data
for the previous and the current periods. These tools give an idea of
[historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) data for a particular period. A lagging indicator follows the
price, not goes ahead. An example of a lagging indicator is Moving
Averages.

The price chart (blue line) reverses at points “1”, “3’, “5”, “7”. The
EMA indicator (yellowish line) also reverses following the price, but a
little later, at points “2”, “4”, “6”, “8”.

Although trend indicators are often lagging, while oscillators are
leading, a lot of [trading strategies](https://www.fintechee.com/forex-trading-strategies/) are based on trend indicators.
Oscillators are used to confirm the signal. This is because traders
should first determine the beginning and the direction of the trend.
Signals sent by lagging indicators are considered to be more reliable
because they analyze [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) data together with the current price
movement.

## Forex Trading Indicators Types

Technical analysis indicators can be grouped according to several
parameters:

  1. Price movement nature:

    * Trend following indicators. These tools help to identify the start and the beginning of the trend. They are used to determine the market state – flat or trending. Trending indicators are used in wave strategies, they help to distinguish between correction and trend.

    * Oscillators. They do not indicate the direction of the price movement. Oscillators indicate the overbought and oversold zones (O/O zones), helping to determine the pivot points.

  2. Time of the signal relative to the price:

    * Lagging indicators. The indicator signals come following the price. The current price value first appears in the chart. The indicator value is calculated based on the price and displayed in the chart sometime later. 

    * Leading indicators. These tools help to evaluate the potential strength of the trend.

    * Forecasting indicators. They are thought to be the best trading indicators that look for patterns in particular intervals of previous periods, after which they display the most probable price movement for the next few candlesticks.

  3. Scope of application:

    * Channel indicators. These tools build price channels, where the price is moving most of the time. 

    * Volume indicators. They indicate trade volumes for a particular period.

    * Levels indicators. These indicators can build important levels, which are not visible in the chart.

    * Pattern indicators. Pattern indicators are designed to spot the chart patterns that have already formed or just started forming and are not visible in the chart yet. 

    * Divergence indicators. They help to discover a divergence. Read more about divergence and convergence in [this article][3]. 

    * Volatility indicators. These tools indicate the current volatility of the asset price relative to the previous period.

    * Scalping indicator. They are used for quick market analysis in short timeframes.

    * Information indicators. They show the level of the current spread, divide the chart into sessions, and display trading statistics. 

  4. Type of visualization:

    * Arrows. They mark the signal candlestick with a dot or an arrow.

    * Attached to the chart. In the basic version, they are displayed directly in the chart.

    * Displayed under the chart. In the original version, such tools are located under the trading chart. 

  5. Algorithm complexity:

### Trend Following Indicators

Trend following indicators identify the beginning and the end of the
price rise or fall. Trend indicators can be lagging and leading. They
indicate the direction of the price trend and its strength. Trend
following tools are often applied as primary indicators in all types of
strategies, day trading, medium- and long-term [trading strategies](https://www.fintechee.com/forex-trading-strategies/). Trend
tools are not the best trading indicators when the market is trading
flat; they are rarely used in scalping or short-term swing trading.

Examples: Moving Averages, TEMA, Alligator, [Parabolic SAR](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/parabolic-sar.html).

#### Moving Averages

Category: lagging

[MA, EMA][4] is an indicator that calculates the average price values
for the period specified in the settings. The price for each previous
period will have less and less weight. Moving Averages are used for the
price forecasts and creating different [trading strategies](https://www.fintechee.com/forex-trading-strategies/). When MAs are
applied in the trading systems, traders estimate the price deviation
from its average value, which confirms the trend direction, inclinations
angle, and price location relative to the MAs.

 **SMA calculation formula ([Simple Moving Average](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/simple-moving-average.html))**

SMA = SUM (Close (i), N)/N

N is the period, the number of candlesticks analyzed, you specify in the
settings. Close(i) is the closing price of each candlestick in the
sequence. In MA settings, you can also specify other types of prices.

A simple moving average is the arithmetic mean. The modifications of
moving averages are EMA, WMA, LWMA. Their calculation formulas are
different as different periods have different weights, depending on the
candlestick number in the sequence, trading volumes, and so on.

 **EMA calculation formula:**

ЕМА(i) = k * P(i) + (1-k)*ЕМА(i-1)

k is the weight coefficient, taking into account the smoothing period.
Р(i) is the current price.

 **Example of application:**

 ****

Signal: the fast (blue) MA crosses the slow one (yellow); both MAs are
clearly directed up or down. At points “1” and “3”, the blue MA crosses
the yellow one to the upside, so the trend is up. At point “2”, the fast
MA crosses the slow one to the downside, the trend is down.

The MA indicator is suitable for:

  * Day trading, medium- and long-term [trading strategies](https://www.fintechee.com/forex-trading-strategies/). Because of lagging, there are quite many false signals in scalping and strategies based on fundamental analysis.
  * Timeframes from М15-М30 and longer. The MA is a frequently used indicator to analyze the long-term market trend in [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) and weekly intervals.
  * Any trading assets. MAs are most often used in trading currency pairs and securities.

Moving Averages are among the best forex indicators for beginner
traders. The calculation formula is simple, the interpretation of the
signals is straightforward. Try various parameters for different types
of MA, and you will understand [how to](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-trading-how-to/) develop and [optimize](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/17/added-genetic-algorithm-for-trading/) simple
trading systems.

#### Triple EMA (TEMA)

 **Category:** leading.

[TEMA][4] is a modification of the exponential moving average. The
Triple [Exponential Moving Average](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/exponential-moving-average.html) incorporates EMA and a double
exponential moving average (DEMA). It is an alternative to the common
ЕМА in trend following [trading strategies](https://www.fintechee.com/forex-trading-strategies/), as the TEMA reduces the
influence of lagging.

 **TEMA calculation formula:**

TEMA(i) = 3*EMA(i) – 3*EMA(EMA(i)) + EMA(EMA(EMA(i)))

 **Example of application:**

 ****

The signal of the trend appears when the price crosses the TEMA line and
stays above/below it. If two consecutive candlesticks close above/below
TEMA, you can enter a trade in the direction of the up/down trend. When
the settings are [optimize](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/17/added-genetic-algorithm-for-trading/)d, the signals are 80% profitable.

The TEMA indicator is suitable for:

  * Trend following strategies, counter-trend trading, swing trading, long-term forecasts. It is rarely used in scalping.
  * Timeframes of H1 and longer. Rarely used timeframes are М15-М30.
  * Any trading asset: Forex, stocks, commodities, cryptocurrencies.

The TEMA is among the best forex indicators for traders using such tools
as all types of moving averages or Alligator. The TEMA fits well with
oscillators.

#### Parabolic Stop and Reverse ([Parabolic SAR](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/parabolic-sar.html))

 **Category:** lagging

The [[Parabolic SAR](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/parabolic-sar.html)][5] is a trend indicator used to determine good entry
points and determine the pivot levels. The signal's interpretation is
similar to moving averages. If the [Parabolic SAR](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/parabolic-sar.html) dots are below the
price, the trend is up. An additional signal: the shorter the distance
between the dots and the price, the faster the trend is, and the more
likely the trend is to reverse.

 **Calculation formula:**

PSAR(uptrend) = (Н(i-1) - PSAR(i-1))*AF + PSAR(i-1)

PSAR(downtrend) = (L(i-1) - PSAR(i-1))*AF + PSAR(i-1)

H stands for high. L – for low; (i-1) is the previous candlestick

AF is the acceleration factor. The start value is 0.02, which increases
with each next candlestick.

AF = 0,02 + Х*k

X is the number of periods, k is the step of the price change.

 **Example of application:**

 ****

It is clear from the screenshot that [Parabolic SAR](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/parabolic-sar.html) sent a false signal
only once, it is marked with a blue arrow. In other cases, the trend
direction is forecast accurately. It is also clear that [Parabolic SAR](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/parabolic-sar.html)
lags by 2-5 candlesticks.

[Parabolic SAR](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/parabolic-sar.html) is suitable for:

  * Trend following, counter-trend medium- and long-term strategies. The [Parabolic SAR](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/parabolic-sar.html) developer recommends employing the indicator for [trading strategies](https://www.fintechee.com/forex-trading-strategies/) that are 1-2 weeks long. It doesn’t work when the market is trading flat.
  * Defining the levels for stop loss and take profit.
  * Timeframes of Н1-Н4 and longer.
  * Forex, commodities, securities, stock indexes, cryptocurrencies.

The indicator is suitable for beginner traders because the trading
signals are easy to find and interpret. It will also be of interest to
experienced traders who use a trailing stop.

#### Ichimoku cloud

 **Category:** leading

The [Ichimoku cloud][6] ([Ichimoku Kinko Hyo](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/ichimoku-kinko-hyo.html)) is a trend following indicator used to gauge the price momentum together with the price volatility changes. The [Ichimoku Kinko Hyo](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/ichimoku-kinko-hyo.html) is composed of five lines that make up ranges- clouds. The lines themselves, according to the principle of analysis, are compared with moving averages. The Ichimoku indicator is used to identify the trend, define the support and resistance levels, entry and exit price zones.

 **Ichimoku calculation formula:**

Tenkan-Sen: (Max(High,N)+Min(Low,N))/2

Max and Min are extreme price values for the period N specified in the
settings.

Kijun-Sen: (Max(High,M)+Min(Low,M))/2

Max and Min are extreme price values for the period M specified in the
settings.

Senkou Span A: (Tenkan-Sen+Kijun-Sen)/2, projected ahead by period M.

Senkou Span B:(Max(High, Z)+Min(Low, Z))/2, projected ahead by period M.

Max and Min are extreme price values for the period Z specified in the
settings.

Chikou Span is the current Close projected back by period M.

 **Example of application:**

 ****

The indicator lines form ranges – clouds. If the price is below the
clouds, the trend is down; if it is above the clouds, the trend is up.
The green cloud means the potential continuation of the uptrend; the red
one – the downtrend could continue. Senkou Span lines serve as key
levels, which can be used in the breakout strategies or for setting stop
losses.

The Ichimoku cloud is suitable for:

  * Trend following strategies in the highly volatile markets.
  * Timeframes of H1 and longer. Ichimoku is one of the best trading indicators for long-term trends in the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) timeframes. It could be employed in the minute intervals for scalping trading, but are quite rare.
  * Ichimoku is most often applied to trading currency pairs.

For experienced traders, the Ichimoku cloud is one of the best
indicators for forex. Traders should be able to quickly discover and
interpret the signals at multiple lines and ranges together with the
price location. Therefore, the toll could be a bit complicated for
[beginners](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-for-beginners/).

#### [Alligator Indicator](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/alligator.html)

 **Category:** lagging

The Williams [Alligator][7] indicates entry points when there starts an
impulse movement. The Alligator indicator is composed of three moving
averages with different periods and shifts. When the lines
simultaneously go apart, there could start a new trend. When the
indicator lines meet, the trend should be exhausting. When the lines are
interwoven or move horizontally close to each other, the market is
trading flat.

 **Calculation formula:**

Median Price (МР) = (High+Low)/2

Other technical indicators most often analyze the Close Price. The
Alligator employs the median price, calculated as the arithmetic mean of
the high and the low.

The Jaw line: Smoothed МА (МР, 13, 8)

The Teeth line: Smoothed МА (МР, 8, 5)

The Lips line: Smoothed МА (МР, 5, 3)

 **Example of application:**

The arrows mark the points where MAs go apart. With a slight lag, the
divergence of the lines shows a clear trend. The points where the lines
meet or interweave are marked with red boxes – the market is trading
flat with equal price moves in both directions.

The Alligator is suitable for:

  * Trend following strategies. Alligator signals a flat when the lines meet and the start of the trend – when the lines go apart.
  * Determining the beginning and the end of a trend. It accurately shows when the trend is about to start.
  * Timeframes of H1 and longer. Due to the lag, the Alligator is not very effective in the timeframes shorter than H1.
  * Trading currency pairs.

Alligator is one of the best indicators for forex. It is suitable for
[beginners](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-for-beginners/) using intraday, medium- and long-term strategies. A simple
combination of MAs with different periods accurately identifies the
trend.

#### KDJ

 **Category:** lagging

 **KDJ** is a technical indicator used to determine the strength and
direction of the trend. KDJ is composed of three lines with different
periods, located under the trading chart.

 **Calculation formula:**

К = KFactor * PrevK + DFactor * RSV

RSV = ((Close – Min low) / (Max high – Min low)) * 100

D = KFactor * PrevD + DFactor * K

J = 3 * D - 2 * K

Max high and Min low are price extremes for a period specified in the
settings. KFactor, DFactor are factors specified in the settings.

 **Example of application:**

 ****

The signal appears when all three lines cross. A buy signal: the red
line is above the blue, and the blue one is above the green. A sell
signal: The red line is below the blue, and the blue one is below the
green. The farther the lines are from each other, the stronger the
signal is.

It is suitable for:

  * Trend following strategies; day trading, medium- and long-term strategies. It doesn’t work when the market is trading flat.
  * For timeframes of H1 and longer.
  * For any trading asset, except for cryptocurrencies.

The KDJ will be of use for traders using trading systems, based on trend
following indicators, oscillators, and Price Action. It fits well with
the Alligator and the stochastic.

#### TD Sequential indicator

 **Category:** lagging

[TD Sequential][8] is one of the best Forex indicators used to spot the
end of local trends and determine pivot points. This forecasting tool
consists of three elements: ****The first element is Price flip, a
pattern composed of six candlesticks that signal a potential reversal.
The second element is Setup, a pattern composed of nine candlesticks. At
this stage, the indicator identifies whether the Price flip is a trend
reversal or just a correction. The third element is CountDown which is
composed of 13 candlesticks. It counts the candlesticks from the start
of the new trend to the new reversal, Price flip. The indicator counts
only the candlesticks that meet certain requirements.

Calculation formula: The indicator compares the closing prices of the
current candlestick with the previous ones according to a specific
algorithm that differs for each of the three indicator elements.

 **Example of application:**

 ****

The indicator divides the chart into three parts, each differently
marked: large numbers under the candlesticks, small numbers above the
candlesticks, reversal patterns.

It is suitable for:

  * Japanese candlestick charts. The indicator will work only on candlesticks or bars.
  * Trend following long-term strategies, which include Price Action elements. The trading range of the indicator, including all three elements, is at least 25-28 candlesticks. It sends very rare signals.
  * Timeframes of H4 and longer. In shorter timeframes, there are many incomplete patterns interrupting the indicator working procedure.
  * Currency pairs, cryptocurrencies.

It is one of the best indicators for forex if you are a professional
trader and can spot reversal patterns and understand mathematical
formulas of complex indicators.

#### TD Moving Average (by DeMark)

 **Category:** lagging ****

[TD Moving Average][9] (by DeMark) is an advanced version of the Moving Average used to define the market trend. The indicator determines the ongoing trend and can be used to detail the levels to set trailing stop, entry, and exit points.

 **Calculation formula:** The indicator compares the highs and lows of
the current candlesticks with the previous ones and draws an upward or
downward trend based on the forecast.

 **Example of application:**

This is one of the best forex indicator combinations, drawing a price
range, based on the MAs.

TD Moving Average is suitable for:

  * Trend following medium- and long-term strategies.
  * Currency pairs and cryptocurrencies. Less commonly, it is used for stocks and indexes.
  * Timeframes of H4 and longer.

It is recommended to professional traders who understand the algorithm
of the indicators signals formation.

#### Coppock Curve

 **Category:** lagging

 **Coppock Curve** is a trend indicator, based on the moving average,
fast and slow oscillator lines of the ROC indicator. The indicator can
look like lines or a histogram.

 **Calculation formula:**

CC = WMA (ROC(s) + ROC(q))

WMA is the weighted moving average. ROC is the Price Rate of Change
indicator; its formula is covered in the section devoted to oscillators.
ROC(s) and ROC(q) are slow and fast oscillators.

 **Example of application:**

 ****

Signal: averaged weighted values of the indicators start rising, the
market is trending up. If the values are lowering, the trend is down. It
is clear from the screenshot, the Coppock Curve accurately shows the
trends, appearing short-term, that could last for 7-14 days in the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/)
timeframes.

The Coppock Curve is suitable for:

  * Long-term strategies. According to the recommendations of the ****Coppock Curve developer, the indicator is applied to the search of long-term trends in monthly charts, for which the default settings are adjusted.
  * Timeframes D1-MN.
  * Currency pairs, stocks that have clear long-term trading ranges. It is often used to trade exotic currency pairs.

The Coppock Curve will serve well to long-term [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s, applying
strategies with an investment horizon from 1-2 weeks to a month or more.

#### ZigZag

 **Category:** complementary

[ **ZigZag**][10] is an additional, complementary tool, which connects
important extremes in the price chart, ignoring short, random price
moves. It doesn’t predict the future price movement, indicating
important price changes in the past. The shorter the period is, the more
zigzags are on the indicator.

 **Calculation formula** : the algorithm of the search for candlesticks’
highs and lows, according to the deviation, the number of candlesticks
between the extremes and the period.

 **Example of application:**

 ****

It is applied to identify the trend and build support and resistance
levels. It also helps to discover technical chart patterns.

The ZigZag indicator is suitable for:

  * Medium- and long-term [trading strategies](https://www.fintechee.com/forex-trading-strategies/). Trading systems based on the Elliott wave theory. For analyzing trends in longer timeframes to further trade in shorter timeframes. It is well combined with channel indicators.
  * Timeframes of H4 and higher.
  * Any trading assets, currency pairs, cryptocurrencies, or stock derivatives.

The ZigZag indicator will be suitable as a complementary tool for all
traders, who carry out long-term trend analysis.

### Oscillators

[Momentum](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/momentum.html) indicators and oscillators are technical tools that measure the
rate of the price change over a specified period. Such types of tools
define whether the bullish or bearish volumes dominate. They often have
values ranging from 0 to 100. If the indicator moves closer to the range
border, reverses, and goes towards the median value, the trend could be
exhausting, and the market could start trading flat. They refer to
technical tools used to confirm or detail signals; they can be leading
or lagging, depending on the indicator category. These tools perform
well in range markets.

 **Examples:** stochastic oscillator, RSI, CCI, [Momentum](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/momentum.html).

#### [Momentum](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/momentum.html) Indicator

 **Category:** leading

[ **[Momentum](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/momentum.html)**][11] **** is a technical indicator used to measure the
rate of the price change over a specific period. It is based on the idea
of a sharp price rise/fall at the moment of the trend final stage. If
the price is rising, more people will be willing to buy an asset with
each new candlestick. The stronger the price fall is, the more people
will be willing to sell. If the oscillator is close to highs/lows, the
trend should continue in the short term. If the signal line reverses at
the high/low, the trend should also reverse.

 **Calculation formula:**

MOMENTUM = Close(i)/Close(i-n) * 100%

Close(i) is the current candlestick closing price, Close(i-n) is the
closing price n candlesticks ago.

 **Example of application:**

 ****

The signal is formed at the price extremes. The oscillator has made a
bottom, it is time to set a buy order; if the oscillator makes a top,
one should set a sell order. The screenshot shows that the indicator
sends accurate buy signals in the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) timeframe; the top signals the
trend end. In general, the indicator spots short price movements of 3-5
candlesticks, so it performs the best in the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) timeframe.

[Momentum](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/momentum.html) is suitable for:

  * Trend following, intraday, medium- and long-term [trading strategies](https://www.fintechee.com/forex-trading-strategies/). It is less commonly used in scalping.
  * Any timeframe.
  * Any assets: currency pairs, cryptocurrencies, stocks, and commodities.

It is one of the best day trading indicators for [beginners](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-for-beginners/). The momentum
has a simple, straightforward formula, it fits well with trend following
indicators.

#### [Stochastic Oscillator](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/stochastic-oscillator.html)

 **Category:** lagging ****

The[Stochastic][12] is an oscillator that measures a particular closing
price of a security to a range of its prices over a certain period. The
indicator line moves between values 0 and 100. The range of 20-0 is the
oversold zone, and 80-100 is the overbought zone. When the stochastic is
within one of the zones, it may mean a soon trend reversal. The
Stochastic is used to identify the beginning of the new trending
movement, pivot points, search for local highs/lows, divergences.

 **Calculation formula:**

%К (primary line) = (Close - Min(n))/(Max(n) - Min(n))*100%

%D (additional line - signal, dotted) = SМА (%К, n)

Close — closing price of the current candlestick, Min(n), Max(n) — low
and high over a period specified in the settings, SMA — simple moving
average.

 **Example of application:**

 ****

The stochastic is following the trend. The indicator reversal in the
overbought zone means the end of the strong, trending movement, which
could be followed by the trading flat or the trend reversal.

Stochastic is suitable for:

  * Trend following strategies, based on the signals at the trend reversal points.
  * Day [trading strategies](https://www.fintechee.com/forex-trading-strategies/) based on divergence. The divergence between the price chart and the oscillator could mean the trend reversal.
  * Timeframes of M30-H1. In shorter timeframes, the indicators are too sensitive to random market noises.
  * Any currency pairs, stocks, and stock indexes. It is less commonly applied to trading crypto.

It is recommended to [beginners](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-for-beginners/) traders as one of the best indicators for
forex, as it is not complicated and the signals are easily interpreted.
An example of the oscillator application is confirmation of the signals
sent by trend-following indicators combined with other oscillators CCI,
MACD, RSI.

#### [Commodity Channel Index](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/commodity-channel-index.html) (CCI)

 **Category:** leading

CCI is the oscillator measuring the deviation of the current price from
its average value. The indicator is moving in the range between -100 and
100. When the signal line goes outside the range, it will mean the
overbought or oversold state of the market. In this case, the steady
movement towards its median value.

 **Calculation formula (step by step):**

  1. Typical price (TP) = (H+L+C)/3, where H is the high of the candlestick, L is the low of the candlestick, C is the closing price of the candlestick.
  2. SMA (TP, N) = SUM (TP, N)/N. A simple moving average, calculated based on typical prices for the period of N candlestick. The formula for the arithmetic mean: all TPs are summed up and divided by their number.
  3. D = TP - SMA (TP, N). There is calculated the difference between the typical price of each candlestick and SMA.
  4. SMA (D, N) = SUM (D, N)/N. The calculation of the moving average of the D values.
  5. М = SMA (D, N) * 0,015.
  6. CCI = M/D.

 **Example of application:**

 ****

The CCI rise confirms the trend. The start of the reversal could mean
the end of the trending movement. The CCI signals are not often
accurate, so the indicator should be used together with other
oscillators of trend following indicators.

The CCI is suitable for:

  * Any types of trend following and counter-trend [trading strategies](https://www.fintechee.com/forex-trading-strategies/).
  * Any timeframes. Most commonly used in the timeframes are М30 – Н4 with different settings.
  * Any trading assets.

It is recommended to use the CCI together with other popular
oscillators, RSI and stochastic.

#### [Relative Strength Index](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/relative-strength-index.html) (RSI)

 **Category:** leading

The [RSI][13] is a popular technical indicator measuring the relative
strength of bulls and bears and the probability of the trend reversal.
The signal line is moving in the range between 0 and 100. The closer the
line is to the upper/lower border, the more overbought/oversold the
asset is, and the more likely the trend is to reverse.

 **Calculation formula:**

Calculation of RS:

The SMA is a simple moving average, N is the calculation period, U and D
are values obtained by comparing the prices of the current and the
previous candlesticks.

 **Example of application:**

 ****

At the section marked with box 1, the RSI has been in the oversold zone
for a long time, which is a signal of the trend reversal. The same
situation is at the section marked with box, the RSI has been in the
overbought zone, which also means the trend could reverse. The index
goes down in section 3, which confirms the downtrend.

The RSI is suitable for:

  * Any type of assets, most often currency pairs.
  * Timeframes of M30 and higher.
  * Intraday [trading strategies](https://www.fintechee.com/forex-trading-strategies/), swing trading, long-term trend analysis. Experts do not recommend using the RSI in scalping.

The RSI will be of interest to traders of any experience. For [beginners](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-for-beginners/),
it is recommended to use the RSI together with the CCI.

#### Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)

 **Category:** lagging

[MACD][14] is a popular trend following indicator of the oscillator
type. It measures the degree of divergence or convergence of the
exponential MAs. The tool is composed of two lines and a histogram. The
primary MACD line defines the price momentum, whether it is up or down.
The signal line helps to identify the pivot points of a steady trend and
provides entry signals.

 **Calculation formula:**

MACD (primary line) = EMA (Close, SP) - EMA (Close, FP)

SP - calculation period of the slow ЕМА, FP - period of the fast ЕМА.
Close — closing price.

MACD (signal line) = SMA (MACD “primary line”, P)

SMA — simple moving average, Р — period of the signal

The histogram shows the difference between the primary and signal lines
of the MACD.

 **Example of application:**

 ****

The primary and signal lines cross at sections 1-2 and 4-5, and the
histogram bars are rising. If both lines are directed down, and the bars
are increasing downside, below the zero line, the trend is down. For an
uptrend – the situation is the opposite. The longer the bars are, the
stronger the trend is. In section 3, the MACD lines converge, and the
bars are small, the market is balanced.

MACD is suitable for:

  * Mostly, currency pairs, cryptocurrencies, and stocks.
  * Timeframes of H1 and longer.
  * Any types of [trading strategies](https://www.fintechee.com/forex-trading-strategies/), except for scalping and trading based on fundamental analysis.

MACD is recommended to traders who are already familiar with the types
of MAs and want to employ more complex tools.

#### [Average Directional Index](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/average-directional-index.html) (ADX)

 **Category:** leading

[ADX][15] is a combination of a trend-following indicator and an
oscillator. The ADX indicator is composed of two elements moving in the
range of 0% -100%. The primary ADX element displays the trend strength
but doesn’t indicate the direction. If the primary indicator line is
above 40%, the trend is strong. It is likely to reverse, however, the
ADX line could stay at the same level after the price reversal.
Additional lines +DI and -DI indicate the trend direction. If +DI is
above -DI and is moving up, the trend is up.

 **Calculation formula:**

 ****

The calculation of + DI, -DI is phased and takes into account the price
True Range (TR), adjusted for the exponential MA.

 **Example of application:**

 ****

One of the ADX signals is when its two additional lines meet. In the
first case, the blue DI+ crosses the red DI- to the upside, it signals
an uptrend. In the second case, the blue line crosses the red one to the
downside. The rising blue ADX line means the trend is strengthening,
irrespective of its direction.

The ADX is suitable for:

  * Trend following intraday, medium- and long-term strategies. It doesn’t work when the market is trading flat. The ADX sends accurate signals when the sideways trend ends.
  * Timeframes of М30-Н4. In the timeframes shorter than M30, the ADX sends many false signals.
  * Any assets. Most commonly, the ADX is used in trading currency pairs; less often – in trading commodities or stocks.

The ADX is recommended to traders with a basic and above-the-basic level
of knowledge of technical analysis. The indicator has multiple lines,
and there are many interpretations of the signals. Therefore, it may
seem a bit complicated to newbies.

#### Laguerre indicator

 **Category:** leading

The [Laguerre indicator][16] is a trend-following indicator, designed as
an oscillator, whose values vary in the range of 0-1. In some
modifications, there are now values limiting the range. The Laguerre
indicator is used to spot micro trends and define the market cycles.

The calculation formula: the Laguerre indicator, uses spectral analysis
of maximum entropy based on the Laguerre polynomials. The basic
calculation principle is similar to the RSI formula, which is
supplemented with the four-component Laguerre filter.

 **Example of application:**

The screenshot above displays the general view of the oscillator in one
of the modifications. It is clear that the indicator is quite accurately
following the trend. Unlike common oscillators, this tool is difficult
to interpret, according to the overbought/oversold zones. So, I
recommend studying the detailed [guide][16] to understand the signals
search and interpretation.

It is suitable for:

  * Scalping, swing trading, with additional tools to confirm the signals. The Laguerre could serve as independent indicators in long-term [trading strategies](https://www.fintechee.com/forex-trading-strategies/) without any complementary indicators. An example of such a strategy is a system based on the fast and slow Laguerre indicators.
  * Currency pairs.
  * Timeframes of М5-М15 and longer.

It can be recommended to beginner traders mastering new professional
tools. It also will be of interest to scalpers and swing traders.

#### Rate of change (ROC)

 **Category:** leading

ROC is an oscillator measuring the rate of the price change for a
specific period. When the ROC indicator is around the center line 0, the
market must be consolidating. If the ROC is above the zero line, the
market is bullish, if the indicator is below the zero value, the market
is bearish.

 **Calculation formula:**

ROC (N, i) = (Close(i) - Close (i-N) ) / Close (i-N)

Close (i) — current closing price. Close (i-N) — closing price N periods
ago.

 ** **Example of application:****

 ****

The horizontal zero line is the reference. If the ROC indicator starts
moving up or down from the zero level, one could consider entering a
trade. The above screenshot displays four signals to enter a sell trade.

The ROC indicator is suitable for:

  * Intraday, medium, and long-term strategies. It is less suitable for scalping or swing trading, as there are many false signals in short periods.
  * Any trading assets, including stocks and cryptocurrencies.
  * Timeframes of H1 and longer.

ROC is suitable for traders of any level of skills as an additional
complementary tool.

#### Ease of Movement Indicator

 **Category:** leading

The Ease of Movement indicator measures the relationship between the
price and volume and displays the result as an oscillator. The ease of
movement value gauges the strength of the market momentum.

 **Calculation formula:**

DM = (High(i) + Low(i))/2 - (High(i-1) + Low(i-1))/2

High, Low — the highest and the lowest price value ; i, (i-1) — current
and previous prices.

BR = (Current Volume/D) / (High(i) - Low(i))

D - denominator, specified in the settings.

Period EOM = DM/BR

EOM = SMA (Period EOM)

SMA — simple moving average.

 **Example of application:**

This is one of the examples of a profitable forex strategy. In the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/)
chart, the EOM line is smoothed, moving along with the zero line. A
sharp deviation up means a strong uptrend. In this case, the EOM sends
signals late, but it is possible to make a profit from two or three
candlesticks. Next, the indicator turns down, which is a signal to enter
a trade in the opposite direction. If we switch to a shorter timeframe,
we could pick up more insignificant price swings, but the quality of
signals will be worse.

The oscillator is sensitive to the increase in trade volumes. The flat
movement around the zero line means that the trading volumes are small,
and the market must be trading flat. The higher/lower is the EOM
relative to the zero line, the easier the price is moving up or down due
to the increase in trading volumes.

The indicator is suitable for:

  * Any type of strategy, except for scalping. Like the ROV, the EOM refers to momentum oscillators, so these two tools could be used together in trading systems.
  * Timeframes of H1 and longer.
  * Any type of asset. It is more often used in stock trading, where real trade volumes are taken into account.

#### Know Sure Thing Indicator (KST)

 **Category:** leading

 **KST** **** is an oscillator displaying the overbought/oversold zones,
smoothed rate of change. It is based on moving averages with four
periods. Thus, the short-term insignificant price swings are ignored,
and strong long-term trends are identified. The indicator is moving
around the central zero line, the range of movements is not limited.
Signals are rare but accurate. It is often used together with trend-
following instruments.

 **Calculation formula:**

Primary line: KST=МА(ROC1, Period1)*W1 + МА(ROC2, Period2)*W2 + МА(ROC3,
Period3)*W3 + МА(ROC4, Period4)*W4

Signal line = МА(KST, Period)

W is the weight coefficient specified in the settings. ROC - Rate of
change, MA- moving average.

 **Example of application:**

Signal to enter a long trade: primary (yellow) line crosses the signal
line (blue) from the bottom up. It is preferable that the lines should
cross in the negative zone. The opposite crossing of the line at the
extreme points relative to the zero level means the end of a steady
trend. In the screenshot above, signals 1,3,5 are winning, 2 is false, 4
is a weak signal.

The KST indicator is suitable for:

  * Long-term strategies. It is used to spot a strong long-term momentum and corrections. The KST performs well in trend-following strategies and long-term swing trading.
  * Long positions. It is statistically determined that the number of false signals for short positions increases sharply.
  * Timeframes of H1-H4. The indicator developer recommends using the MN timeframe.
  * Any assets. It was originally designed for stock trading, but it performs well in the forex and derivatives markets.

The KST indicator will be of interest to traders, who prefer long-term
trading systems, aiming to search trend movements and position reversal
on the local corrections.

#### Percentage Price Oscillator (PPO)

 **Category:** lagging

 **RPO** is a momentum oscillator based on the relation of the EMA with
a different period. The analysis principle is similar to the MACD; the
indicator can be displayed as two curves and a histogram under the price
chart.

 **Calculation formula:**

Primary line PPO = ((EMA(12) – EMA(26)) / ЕМА(26))) * 100

Signal line = ЕМА(9)

Histogram = primary line - signal line

 **Example of application:**

Signals: you open a long position when the primary line crosses the
signal line from bottom to up, a short position – from top to down. The
signal is stronger: for a buy trade – the lines cross under the zero
line; for a sell – the lines cross above the zero line. An additional
signal is the location of the histogram. A sell signal is when the
histogram is in the negative zone and lowering. In the screen above, all
signals, except for 2, are winning.

The PPO indicator is suitable for:

  * Usual trading systems, from scalping to intraday and long-term, strategies.
  * Timeframes of М15-Н4.
  * Any assets. It is quite often used in trading stocks.

The RPO will be of interest to beginner traders who want to get familiar
with different types of indicators. It can be replaced by the MACD.

#### Mass Index

 **Category:** lagging

 **Mass Index** indicator is a forecasting range oscillator, which
measures the rate of change of the highest and lowest price for a period
specified in the settings. The Mass Index is used to determine pivot
points. It doesn’t indicate the trend direction. The IM is most often
employed in the search for exit points.

 **Calculation formula:** MI = SUM (EMA (High-Low, 9) / EMA (EMA (High-
Low, 9),9), Р)

High, Low — extreme prices for nine candlesticks. Р — period specified
in the settings. EMA — exponential moving average.

 **Example of application:**

 ****

The rising MI line means the increase in the difference between the
extreme values, suggesting the increase in volatility. If the indicator
reverses in the extreme points, the trend could also reverse. At point
1, the uptrend continues after the local correction, and the signal
needs confirmation. At points 2,3, and 6, the signals are clear, and the
trend reverses in all three cases. At point 4, the signal is false. At
point 5, we do not consider the signal, as the market is trading flat.

The Mass Index is suitable for:

  * Scalping, swing trading, day [trading strategies](https://www.fintechee.com/forex-trading-strategies/). It is less commonly used in long-term trading systems. The tool doesn’t work when the market is trading flat.
  * Timeframes of M15 and longer.
  * All types of assets.

It is recommended to more experienced traders that know chart patterns
and the principles of the combination of trend indicators with
oscillators.

#### Triple [Exponential Moving Average](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/exponential-moving-average.html) (TRIX)

 **Category: leading**

 **Trend** oscillator TRIX is a modification of the exponential moving
average smoothed several times. It is similar to the TEMA indicator.
Lagging is almost eliminated.

 **Calculation formula:**

ЕМА1 (i) = ЕМА (N, i), where N period.

ЕМА2 (i) = ЕМА (ЕМА1 (N, i))

ЕМА3 (i) = ЕМА (ЕМА2 (N, i))

TRIX = (ЕМА3 (i) - ЕМА3 (i-1)) / ЕМА3 (i-1)

 **Example of application:**

When the TRIX crosses the zero line, it signals a trend reversal. When
the indicator is rising, the trend should be up, provided that the
signal is confirmed with other tools. The same principle is for the
downtrend, only the indicator must be falling.

 **It is suitable for:**

  * Scalping, short-term, and intraday [trading strategies](https://www.fintechee.com/forex-trading-strategies/).
  * For timeframes of М5-Н1.
  * Currency pairs. It performs better for major currency pairs.

The TRIX indicator will be of interest to professional traders with an
active style of trading. It can be used instead of classic oscillators.

#### Vortex Indicator (VI)

 **Category: lagging**

The Vortex Indicator is a trend oscillator, which identifies the start
of the price trend or confirms the current trend. The vortex indicator
plots two oscillating lines, one to identify an uptrend (VI+) and the
other is to identify a downtrend (VI-).

 **Calculation formula:**

iVIP = High(i) - Low(i-1)

iVIM = Low(i) - High(i-1)

For both lines, the indicator compares the current price and the price
of the previous period. The absolute value is taken into account.

sVIP = SMA (iVIP, P)

sVIM = SMA (iVIM, P)

sATR = SMA (ATR, P)

P is the period specified in the settings. SMA is a simple moving
average. ATR is the volatility indicator.

+VI = sVIP/sATR

-VI = sVIM/sATR

 **Example of application:**

There is a signal when the indicator lines cross. If the VI+ goes up
after crossing, the trend is up, if it goes down, the trend is down. The
yellow line in the chart is VI+. All signals are relatively accurate if
you don’t take into account the moments when both lines form a
horizontal interviewing.

 **It is suitable for:**

  * Trend following, medium-, and long-term strategies. It sends relatively many false signals, so you apply additional tools.
  * Timeframes of H1 and longer.
  * Currency pairs, stocks, cryptocurrencies.

It is suitable for traders with a certain degree of experience who can
distinguish between true and false signals of oscillators.

#### Bill Williams [Awesome Oscillator](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/awesome-oscillator.html)

 **Category:** leading ****

[The [Awesome Oscillator](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/awesome-oscillator.html)][11] is based on the moving averages
convergence/divergence. The indicator is displayed as a histogram. The
awesome oscillator helps to determine the trend pivot points; it is
similar to the MACD, but there are some differences: the AO doesn’t have
the signal line. The calculation is based on the median price, not the
closing price.

 **Calculation formula:**

АО = SMA (Median Price, 34) - SMA (Median Price, 5)

In the LiteForex terminal, you can change the period of moving averages.

 **Example of education:**

 ****

Signals:

  1. Crossing of the zero line: from top to bottom-sell; from bottom to top – buy.
  2. Two peaks: if the highs are getting lower – sell; if the lows are getting higher – buy.
  3. A “saucer” pattern to buy. The histogram draws a bottom above the zero line. The first column can be of any colour, the second one is red and lower than the first. The third column is green, higher than the second.
  4. A “saucer” pattern to sell. The histogram draws a bottom above the zero line. The first column can be of any colour, the second one is green and higher than the first. The third column is red, lower than the second.

There are two peaks above the zero line, the second high is lower than
the first. The AO line crosses the zero line, it is a sell signal. The
higher is the histogram, the stronger is the signal.

 **The [Awesome Oscillator](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/awesome-oscillator.html) is suitable for:**

  * Any type of strategy: Sometimes, the AO is used as the primary indicator in some strategies. It can be applied to scalping, but it will be less efficient here than in day [trading strategies](https://www.fintechee.com/forex-trading-strategies/).
  * Timeframes of М15-М30.
  * Almost all currency pairs and stock assets. It was originally designed to trade stocks.

The [Awesome Oscillator](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/awesome-oscillator.html) is good for [beginners](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-for-beginners/). It is user-friendly and
sends straightforward, clear signals. The AO is well combined with the
MACD, being used as a confirming tool.

#### Aroon

 **Category:** lagging

The Aroon indicator is an oscillator used to identify the strength and
the direction of the price trend, trend changes. The indicator line is
moving between levels 0 and 100. Signals: parallel lines – the market is
trading flat, the crossing of the lines means the trend is going to
change. If the Aroon up is in the zone of 70%-100%, the trend is up. If
the Aroon down is in the zone of 0%-30%, the trend is down.

 **Calculation formula.**

Aroon up: (N - H)/N * 100%

Aroon down:  (N - L)/N * 100%

N — calculation period, specified in the settings. H - period (the
number of candlesticks) after the absolute high. L — the period after
the absolute low.

 **Example of application:**

If the yellow line Up is above the blue line Down and is above level 70,
the trend is up. If the Up line is above 70 and the Down line is below
30, the trend could change any time. If the Up line reverses, it could
mean the trend is exhausting or about to end. The signal to enter a
trade is when the lines cross. If the blue line breaks through the
yellow one to the upside around level 50, it is a sell signal. The
yellow line breaks the blue to the upside, it is a buy signal.

 **The Aroon indicator is suitable for:**

  * Defining the end of the sideways trend or the trend change.
  * Intraday, medium-, and long-term strategies. Due to the lag and the analysis complexity, it doesn’t work in scalping, in the sideways trend, swing trading,
  * Timeframes of H1 and longer.
  * All kinds of assets.

The Aroon is suitable for rather experienced traders. The indicator
requires the ability to quickly interpret the lines’ location and
compare the Aroon data with the price chart. Signals are controversial
and need confirmation.

#### Bulls power & Bears power

 **Category:** lagging

 **Bulls power & Bears power **oscillator was developed by Alexander
Elder. It determines the strength of buyers (bulls) vs. sellers (bears).
According to Elder, the moving average is an agreement between buyers
and sellers on the asset price over a fixed period, satisfying both
parties. The current deviation of the MA means a rise in the power of
bulls or bears. In the basic version, the indicator is based on the EMA
(13).

 **Calculation formula:**

Bulls power = High - EMA

 Bears power = Low - EMA

ЕМА - is the exponential moving average. High, Low — extreme values of
the current candlestick.

 **Example of application:**

A sell signal in the downtrend appears when both indicators are above
the zero line and go down into the negative area. A buy signal in the
uptrend appears when both indicators are below zero and start rising,
breaking the zero line to the upside.

 **The indicator is suitable for:**

  * Trend following intraday strategies. Both oscillators are used only in conjunction with trend indicators. The indicator is less efficient in swing trading.
  * Timeframes of М30-Н1. In short timeframes, there are many false signals because of the lack of a clear trend. In long timeframes, the indicator is lagging.
  * Any high-liquid assets. It is not recommended for trading cross currency pairs or exotic currencies.

The Bulls power & Bears power indicator will be of interest to traders
who want to master new types of oscillators in manual day trading
strategies.

#### [Accelerator Oscillator](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/accelerator-oscillator.html)

 **Category:** leading ****

The [Accelerator Oscillator](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/accelerator-oscillator.html) (AC) is an indicator developed by Bill
Williams that helps traders gauge the acceleration of the current
momentum. The AC is based on the idea that the price change results from
the changes in the general momentum. The Oscillator indicates the change
in the momentum direction, which will be followed by the trend change.

 **Calculation formula:**

Median Price = (High + Low)/2

АО ([Awesome Oscillator](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/awesome-oscillator.html)) = SMA (Median Price, 5) - SMA (Median Price, 34)

AC ([Accelerator Oscillator](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/accelerator-oscillator.html)) = AO - SMA (AO, 5)

 **Example of application:**

Signals: a buy signal appears when the columns rise above the central
zero line. The breakthrough of the zero line is not a signal itself. You
can put an order when there are at least two columns of the
corresponding colour (green is for a buy, red – sell). The indicator,
used alone, sends quite many false signals. For example, signals 2, 4,
and 5 in the screenshot are false.

 **The indicator is suitable for:**

  * Trend following strategies, swing trading. It is less effective when the market is trading flat.
  * Timeframes of M15 and longer.
  * Any assets, including stocks and cryptocurrencies.

The [Accelerator Oscillator](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/accelerator-oscillator.html) is recommended to beginner traders as a good
additional tool in combination with common oscillators.

#### Detrended Price Oscillator

 **Category:** leading

Detrended Price Oscillator ****is designed ****for analyzing short-term
trends. It is not a prediction indicator, it doesn’t define the trend.
The indicator signals local short-term corrections within long-term
trends. It fits well with the Elliott wave theory tools.

 **Calculation formula:** horizontal zero line – moving average.

DPO(i) = Close(i) - SMA(Close, (i/2 = 1))

Close is the closing price of the current candlestick, the SMA is a
simple moving average for a period specified in the settings.

 **Example of application:**

 ****

The signal appears when the oscillator line breaks through the zero
line. If the line goes up, it is a buy signal; if the indicator goes
down, it is a sell signal.

 **It is suitable for:**

  * All types of short-term strategies: scalping, short-term swing trading.
  * Timeframes of М5-М15.
  * All types of trading instruments, including cryptocurrencies.

The tool can be recommended to more experienced traders, who prefer
reversing positions or locking.

#### Chande [Momentum](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/momentum.html) Oscillator

 **Category:** leading ****

Chande [Momentum](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/momentum.html) Oscillator measures the rate of the market momentum
change. Unlike other oscillators, the CMO moves in the range of – 100
and +100. The overbought and oversold zones are above 50 and below -50
correspondingly.

 **Calculation formula:**

СМО = (P(u) - P(d)) / (P(u) + P(d)) * 100%

P(u) is the difference between the current close and the previous one.
P(d) is the absolute value of the difference between the current and the
previous candlestick.

 **Example of application:**

 ****

If the indicator line is above +50 or below -50, the trend could reverse
or start trading flat. The longer is the timeframe, the longer should be
the indicator period.

 **It is suitable for:**

  * Trend following intraday and long-term strategies. It is similar to the RSI in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of application.
  * Timeframes of Н4-D1.
  * Currency pairs, including cross currency pairs. It is less commonly used in stock or commodity markets.

#### Fisher Transform Oscillator

 **Category:** leading

Fisher Transform Oscillator ****determines the trend pivot points,
converting prices into a Gaussian normal distribution.

 **Calculation formula** : the calculation is based on the price
extremes of the previous days in the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) timeframe, applying the
Fisher transformation to the relationship between the current price and
the previous price extremes.

 **Example of application:**

The indicator line plots around the zero line, which is marked with a
horizontal dotted line. Other dotted lines on either side of the zero
level indicate possible key points. The location of the lines changes
according to the period specified in the settings. One of the signals is
the location of the oscillator line relative to the levels of 1.5 and
-1.5. If both lines are above 1.5 and start turning down, it is a sell
signal. If both lines are below -1.5 and start turning up, it is a buy
signal.

 **It is suitable for:**

  * Day trading trend strategies. It is less commonly used for intraday swing trading.
  * Timeframes of М30-Н1. The indicator developer doesn’t recommend using the tool in the timeframes longer than H4 because of many false signals.
  * Any trading assets.

#### Ultimate Oscillator

 **Category:** lagging

The Ultimate Oscillator is a range-bound indicator with a value that
fluctuates between 0 and 100. The UO defines the market overbought and
oversold zones by comparing the current prices with the prices of three
previous periods.

 **Calculation formula:** it has a complex formula based on the weighted
moving average.

 **Example of application:**

 ****

Signals: the reversal in the overbought/oversold zone towards the middle
of the range is an entry signal. Another signal is the divergence.

 **It is suitable for:**

  * Long-term strategies.
  * Timeframes of H1 and longer.
  * Currency pairs.

The UO is recommended to professional traders who want to get familiar
with new technical tools. The Ultimate Oscillator sends quite many false
signals and needs constant [optimization](https://www.fintechee.com/features/genetic-algorithm-for-trading/) of settings. It could perform
quite well if you can correctly interpret the signals, using additional
tools, like chart patterns and trend-following tools.

### Volatility Indicators

 **Volatility indicators** measure how far an asset strays from its mean
directional value for a particular period specified in the settings. It
is used in trend following and channel strategies with the analysis of
multiple timeframes.

  * Trend following indicators. The volatility level of a small range of candlesticks is analyzed in longer timeframes. In shorter timeframes, the distance covered by the price at the current moment is estimated.
  * Channel indicators. The channels are built along with the extreme points of the price deviation from the average value. The wider the channel, the higher the volatility. A narrow channel means the market is trading flat. Channel trading systems could be divided into two types of strategies. The first type is based on the channel breakout and the beginner of the trend. The second one suggests the price return to the center of the channel after the rebound from the channel borders.

 **Examples:** Bollinger bands, ATR, standard deviation.

#### [Bollinger Bands](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/bollinger-bands.html)

 **Category:** lagging

[[Bollinger Bands](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/bollinger-bands.html)][17] is a channel indicator combining the features of
the oscillator and a volatility tool. The indicator is composed of three
simple moving averages, the distance of which is measured according to
the standard deviation formula. The [Bollinger Bands](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/bollinger-bands.html) indicator is
employed in channel strategies of two types, the channel breakout trend
following strategy and the price rebound from the channel borders
towards the median price value.

 **Calculation formula:**

ВВ middle line = SMA (Close, N)

SMA - the arithmetic average of the closing prices for the period
specified in the settings.

ВВ channel lines = SMA +/- StdDev

StdDev = (Close - (SMA, N))2N

Close is the closing price of the candlesticks from the sequence. (SMA,
N) is the arithmetic mean of the closing prices of the sequence. N is
the period.

 **Example of application:**

 ****

A narrow channel with short candlesticks suggests a sideways trend. If
the candlestick breaks out the channel, the price is likely to move
towards the channel or its opposite border. The rule doesn’t always
work, so you need to estimate the potential of the reversed trend using
additional tools, oscillators, and Price Action.

 **[Bollinger Bands](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/bollinger-bands.html) indicator is suitable for:**

  * Any [trading strategies](https://www.fintechee.com/forex-trading-strategies/), including trading flat. It is recommended for trend-following channel trading systems.
  * Timeframes of H1 and longer.
  * Currency pairs with a high or medium volatility level. It is less commonly used in stock trading.

The [Bollinger Bands](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/bollinger-bands.html) can be recommended to traders with any skill level.
It can be used by [beginners](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-for-beginners/) for training after they get familiar with
moving averages.

#### [Bollinger Bands](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/bollinger-bands.html) Width

 **Category:** lagging

The [Bollinger Bands](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/bollinger-bands.html) Width is a technical indicator derived from the
[Bollinger Bands](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/bollinger-bands.html) that shows the distance between the upper and the lower
standard deviations of the BB indicator. It is a line, located under the
price chart, whose minimum value is always more than 0. The higher is
the market volatility, the greater is the distance between the Bollinger
bands, and the higher is the BBW value.

 **Calculation formula:** the difference between the upper and the lower
lines of the BB indicator.

 **Example of application:**

 ****

We draw a horizontal BBW level along two or three lows in the zoomed-out
chart, the indicator most often rebounds from the line. We open a
position in the trend direction following one or two candlesticks after
the rebound up. False signals occur; therefore, it is advisable to open
trades only when the BBW rebound was preceded by a narrow flat channel.

 **The BBW is suitable for:**

  * Any trend following strategies, based on channel indicators. It is recommended to add the BBW to the [Bollinger Bands](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/bollinger-bands.html).
  * Timeframes of H1 and longer.
  * Currency pairs with a high level of volatility.

The BBW is good as an additional tool, suitable for traders of any skill
level who work with channel strategies.

#### Keltner channel

 **Category: lagging**

[Keltner channel][18] **** draws the channel of price movements relative
to the central EMA line. The Keltner channel doesn’t follow the price,
thereby showing the continuation of a strong price movement at the
moment of the channel border breakout.

 **Calculation formula:**

TP (Typical price) = (High(i) + Low(i) + Close(i))/3

Range = High(i) - Low(i)

True Range(i) = Max (High(i), Close(i-1)) - Min (Low(i), Close(i-1)

Middle Line = EMA (TP,n) - exponential moving average of the typical
price

Up Line = Middle Line + k*EMA(True Range(i), n)

Down Line =Middle Line - k*EMA(True Range(i), n)

k is the deviation factor (multiplier), specified in the settings, i is
the current price, n is the period, the number of candlesticks analyzed.

 **Example of application:**

An early signal is the channel breakout. A stronger signal is when the
body of the closed candlestick is beyond the channel. If a part of the
candlestick is within the channel, expect another candlestick that
should be of the same colour. The position is closed when the strong
trending movement exhausts or when the price goes back into the channel.
The indicator helps to pick up short local movements of one-three
candlestick and the long-term trends. In the above chart, red lines mark
winning signals, blue ones – false.

 **It is suitable for:**

  * Trend following channel, strategies, and swing trading. The Keltner channel doesn’t work in trading flat, it is not recommended for scalping. The indicator is often used in intraday strategies, less often – in long-term strategies.
  * Timeframes of M30 and longer.
  * Any type of trading assets: currency pairs, cryptocurrencies, stock CFDs, and commodities.

The Keltner channel is recommended to beginner traders as one of the
best forex indicators. Unlike other similar tools, the Keltner channel
doesn’t follow the price immediately, so its signals of the channel’s
breakout are easily and accurately interpreted. It can be the primary
tool of a trading system. The tool fits well with oscillators,
confirming the signal—for example, the RSI.

#### [Average True Range](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/average-true-range.html)

 **Category:** lagging

The [ATR][19] indicator measures the volatility level. It is not bound
by a fixed range, the current values are compared with the previous
ones. The higher are the ATR values, the higher is the volatility, the
faster the price changes. The ATR doesn’t indicate the trend direction.

 **Calculation formula:** The indicator calculates the TR:

Version 1 = High(i) - Low(i)

Version 2 = Close(i) - High(i-1)

Version 3 = Close(i) - Low(i-1)

ATR = Moving Average (TR, m)

MA is averaging all values, TR is the largest absolute value of the
obtained differences, m is the calculation period.

 **Example of application:**

A sharp rise in the ATR value means an increase in volatility. The angle
of the trend movement becomes close to 90%, the length of the
candlestick bodies increases.

 **The ATR is suitable for:**

  * Analysis of the longer timeframes to define the volatility level and switch to a shorter timeframe. It is often used in [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) timeframes in the strategies, which imply trading in H1-H4 timeframes.
  * Scalping, swing trading, fundamental trading in any type of assets.

The ATR is not very useful for newbies due to low information content
and narrow scope of application.

#### Standard Deviation

 **Category:** lagging

The [Standard Deviation][20] is a volatility indicator, measuring the
rate of the price deviation from its mean value. The higher is the SD
value, the greater is the current volatility, and the stronger is the
trend. The longer the indicator line rises, the more likely is the trend
to reverse.

 **Calculation formula:**

 ****

N is the indicator period, the number of the candlesticks analyzed. X is
the closing price of each candlestick in the range. Xavg is the
arithmetic mean of the sample prices. The formula is the standard
deviation.

 **Example of application:**

The increase in the Standard Deviation confirms the uptrend. When the
volatility declines, there appears the consolidation zone, which should
be followed by an uptrend, accompanied by the rise of the SD value. The
tool doesn’t indicate the trend direction.

 **The Standard Deviation indicator is suitable for:**

  * Fundamental [trading strategies](https://www.fintechee.com/forex-trading-strategies/), scalping, swing trading.
  * Timeframes of М30-Н1.
  * Highly volatile assets: cryptocurrencies, major currency pairs.

The tools will be of interest to beginner traders, who learn to spot the
rise in market volatility and try to employ [trading strategies](https://www.fintechee.com/forex-trading-strategies/) based on
the volatility changes. It is rarely used by professional traders.

#### Chaikin Volatility

 **Category:** lagging

Chaikin Volatility Indicator measures the volatility based on the range
between extreme price values. The tool is based on the idea that the
volatility declines during a correction and increases when the trend
starts. The indicator is displayed as a line in the separate window. If
the indicator’s value is above 0, the current volatility is greater than
that taken as a basis; if it is below 0, the volatility is lower than
the reference point taken as a basis. By "taken as a basis" the average
[daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) volatility value is meant.

 **Calculation formula:**

HL(i) = High(i) - Low(i) - the difference between the current high and
low of the candlestick.

HL(i-n) = High(i-n) - Low(i-n) - the difference between the high and low
of period n candlesticks ago.

CHV = (MA(HL(i),n) - MA(HL(i-n),n)) / MA(HL(i-n),n) *100%

MA(HL,n) - moving average for a period n, specified in the settings.

It is suitable for:

  * Trend following strategies, to confirm the signal. The tool could be used to determine the trend pivot points.
  * Timeframes of М30-Н1. It doesn’t work in scalping due to the lag. The tool is not recommended for [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) timeframes, as it doesn’t take into account the gap. It performs well applied to day [trading strategies](https://www.fintechee.com/forex-trading-strategies/).
  * Any trading assets, including stocks and cryptocurrencies.

The Chaikin Volatility Indicator will be of interest to traders who are
familiar with other volatility indicators. Compared to the ATR, the
Chaikin Volatility indicator has more variants of the interpretation of
the signals. Therefore, it could seem a bit complex for [beginners](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-for-beginners/).

#### Volatility Ratio

 **Category:** lagging

 **The М** **olatility Ratio** indicator determines the moments when the
price moves out of its average true range, which means a breakout point.
The indicator moves in the range of 0.01-1. If the VR exceeds 0.5, the
trend may reverse.

 **Calculation formula:** the VR is calculated in several stages. The
price extremes of several candlesticks are compared, and one of the
variants, corresponding to the conditions set, is chosen.

The Volatility Ratio is suitable for: ****

  * Strategies based on determining the moments when the trend exits the average range, which could signal the following trend reversal.
  * Timeframes of H1 and longer.
  * Stock assets. It is less commonly used in trading Forex. 

The Volatility Rate indicator will be of interest for professional
traders trading stock assets. The tool is used only for the market
analysis in combination with primary and confirmation tools.

#### Chande Kroll Stop

 **Category:** lagging

Chande Kroll Stop is ****a trend-following indicator that measures the
price momentum and the average true range of an instrument's volatility.
The Chande Kroll Stop is mostly used to set the stop loss and identify a
sideways trend. The tool helps to avoid exiting a trade too early or
holding it too long, determining an optimal stop loss level.

 **Calculation formula:** The indicator uses the ATR values in the
formula and the multiplier.

  1. ATR calculates the average value for a period (P). By default, it is 10 candlesticks.
  2. The stop-loss level is calculated as the highest high and the lowest low for a period (P).
  3. A stop loss for a long position is calculated by subtracting ATR, a multiple of x(1), from the highest high. X is specified in the settings.
  4. A stop loss for the short position is calculated likewise, but here, the х*ATR parameter is added to the lowest low for nine candlesticks (Q)

 **Example of application:**

 ****

Signals: when both indicator lines make a narrow corridor, the market is
trading flat. The indicator is applied to search for entry signals. If
the candlestick fully or partially closes above the upper line, exit a
short position. If the candlestick closes below the lower line, exit a
long trade.

 **The indicator is suitable for:**

  * Trend following short-term and day [trading strategies](https://www.fintechee.com/forex-trading-strategies/) as a tool to determine the stop loss level. It doesn’t work in scalping.
  * Timeframes of М15-Н4.
  * Any trading assets. It is most commonly applied to trading currency pairs.

The Chande Kroll Stop will be of interest to professional traders, who
can use the Price Action patterns with the indicator signals. The tool
is not recommended to newbies because the signals could be confusing and
difficult to interpret.

### Volume Indicator

The Volume indicators are the tools, whose formula takes into account
trading volumes in addition to the averaged price values for each part
of a period specified in the settings. Trading volume is a measure of
how much of a given financial asset has traded in a period of time.
Compared to common Forex averaging indicators, trading volume indicators
more accurately distribute the weight of each part depending on the
transaction volume. In Forex, volumes mean the number of price ticks
within a specified period. TV indicators are used in trend-following
strategies. They are more suitable for stock markets.

 **Example** : VWAP, OBV.

#### Chaikin Oscillator

 **Category:** leading

The Chaikin Oscillator is a derived oscillator based on the difference
of the moving averages of the Accumulation/Distribution indicator. The
tool can be described by several principles.

  * If the level of the current closing price is higher than the average value for the previous period, the market is in the accumulation stage. If the current close is lower than the average value, there is distribution in the market.
  * The price growth is accompanied by the volume increase. If the volume of transactions is growing slower than the price, the price rise will soon end. The asset can’t rise in price if the trade volume doesn’t increase.

The Chaikin Oscillator helps to monitor the market volumes, and so one
could determine tops and bottoms.

 **Calculation formula:**

CHO = EMA (A/D, N) - EMA (A/D, M)

EMA (A/D) is the exponential moving average of the AD indicator. N and M
are periods, whose default values are N=3, M=10.

A/D(i) =((Close(i) - Low(i)) - (High(i) - Close(i)) / (High(i) - Low(i))
* Volume(i) + A/D(i-1)

Close, High, Low are candlestick prices, i is the current candlestick,
(i-1) is the previous candlestick. Volume(i) is the trade volume of the
current candlestick.

 **The Chaikin Oscillator is suitable for:**

  * Trend following intraday strategies. It doesn’t work for scalping.
  * Exchange-traded assets, such as stocks and derivatives. It is less commonly applied to trading cryptocurrencies.
  * Medium-, and long-term strategies.

The Chaikin Oscillator will be of interest to a professional stock
trader. The tool is rarely applied in Forex trading, as there are
difficulties with the consolidation of real trade volumes.

#### Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP)

 **Category:** lagging

The [VWAP][21] is one of the moving averages derived indicators that
takes trading volumes into account when averaging prices. VWAP is the
abbreviation of the volume-weighted average price. The greater the trade
volume of a particular candlestick, the greater its weight in the total
result. The work algorithm is similar to that of the moving averages.

 **Calculation formula:**

VWAP = SUM ((V + P)/V)

V means the volumes of each candlestick analyzed. P is the Close price
of each candlestick. You can choose another price type in the settings.

 **Example of application:**

The price has been below the VWAP line for a long time, which means a
downtrend. The longer the price stays below the indicator line, the more
likely is the trend to reverse up. The signal of an upside reversal is
when the price breaks through the VWAP line to the upside. The opposite
signal, when the price has been above the VWAP, means an uptrend. The
longer the price stays above the indicator line, the more likely the
trend is to reverse down. When the price chart breaks through the VWAP
line to the downside, the trend is to turn down.

 **The VWAP is suitable for:**

  * Stock trading if there is an opportunity to see the trade volumes online. For Forex trading, there is a simplified VWAP version with limited [functions](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/basic-functions/).
  * Timeframes of М30-Н1 and longer.
  * Medium-, and long-term trend following strategies
  * Medium-, and long-term trend following strategies.

The VWAP will be of interest to professional stock traders. Beginner
traders had better use the Forex version of the VWAP, which has only one
line. The tool fits well with common moving averages.

#### On-Balance Volume (OBV)

 **Category:** leading

The [OBV][22] indicator measures the volume changes along with the price
change. It is displayed as a line under the price chart, the OBV line is
not limited by any range. The tool is used to confirm signals. If the
indicator is rising, the trend is confirmed. If the price chart is going
ahead of the OBV, the trend is not confirmed by the trade volume; it
means the trend is exhausting.

The OBV **calculation formula** ****is as follows: if the current
closing price is higher than the last closing price, the current obv is
added to the previous value. When the previous close is lower than the
current, the current volume is subtracted from the prior value.

 **Example of application:**

 ****

The OBV is a comparative tool. The sharp movement up or down relative to
previous periods, confirming the trend, is taken into account. The
horizontal movement of the indicator is ignored.

 **The OBV indicator is suitable for:**

  * Trend following indicator strategies. It confirms the signal, together with the moving averages, performs well when there is a divergence.
  * Timeframes of Н1-Н4 and longer.
  * Trading stock assets, if there is access to the information on the current stock volumes in real-time.

The OBV is recommended to professional traders who prefer stock market
instruments. It is less useful in Forex and performs worse than other
oscillators in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of signal accuracy and interpretation.

#### Volume Price Trend Indicator (PVT)

 **Category:** lagging

The PVT indicator measures the balance between a security's demand and
supply. It takes into account a percentage increase or decrease, rather
than simply adding or subtracting the volume based on the fact that the
current price is higher or lower than the prices of the previous days.
The PVT confirms the trend similar to the OBV indicator and has a
similar formula.

 **PVT calculation formula:**

PVT=((CLOSE(i) - CLOSE(i-1)) / CLOSE(i-1)) * VOL (i) +PVT (i-1)

Close — closing price, Vol — trade volume.

 **Example of application:**

 ****

The PVT growth means that the price movement is accompanied by an
increase in the cumulative trade volume. The upward movement of the
indicator line confirms an uptrend; the downward movement of the
indicator line confirms a downtrend.

 **The PVT indicator is suitable for:**

  * Trend following strategies, which consider trade volumes. It is used as a complementary tool together with trend indicators and oscillators.
  * Timeframes of H1 and longer.
  * Trading stocks. It is less commonly used in trading Forex amid the lack of real-time information on trade volumes.

The PVT will be of interest to professional traders who use long-term
strategies in stock markets.

#### Volume Rate of Change

 **Category:** lagging

The VROC indicator measures the rate of the volume change. The change of
the VROC value means the following: the longer the trend lasts, the more
traders are willing to enter the market, and the higher are the trade
volumes. However, high trade volumes could also mean that the market is
overbought/oversold, and the trend could reverse soon. The VROC is used
to determine false breakouts: if the price highs/lows are not
accompanied by volume growth, the price extreme is false. There could be
a correction instead of the trend continuation.

 **Calculation formula:**

(Volume(i) - Volume(i-n))/Volume(i-n) * 100%

Volume(i) — trading volume of the current candlestick, Volume(i-n) —
trading volume of the candlestick n periods ago.

 **The VROC is suitable for:**

  * Trend following strategies. It is less commonly used in swing trading and doesn't work in scalping.
  * Timeframes of М30-Н1 and longer.
  * Trading in the stock market where there is access to the real trade volumes data. The tool is rarely used in Forex, as the tick volume is taken into account, i.e., the general amount of the trades entered in both directions, rather than stock market volume.

The VROC is suitable for professional traders who prefer stock assets.

#### Money Flow Index (MFI)

 **Category:** lagging.

MFI is a momentum indicator that measures the flow of money into and out
of a security over a specified period of time. The signals
interpretation is similar to the RSI but also considers trade volumes.
Primary signals are divergence and the overbought/oversold state.

 **Calculation formula:**

Typical price (ТР) = (High + Low + Close)/3

MF = TP * Volume

If the current typical price is higher than the TP of the previous
candlestick, the money flow is positive. If the current TP is lower than
the previous one, the money flow is negative. In the settings, there is
specified the period for which all positive flows and all negative flows
are summed up separately.

MR = Sum of positive flows / Sum of negative flows

MFI = 100 - (100/(1-MR))

 **It is suitable for:**

  * Intraday, medium-, long-term strategies. It is not recommended for scalping, trend-following indicators.
  * Timeframes of М30-Н1 and longer. 
  * Stock trading assets, like equities, indexes, derivatives. It is less commonly used in Forex, as here only tick values are taken into account, rather than volumes.

#### Force Index Indicator

 **Category:** lagging

Force Index is an oscillator that measures the bullish force of price
increases and the bearish force behind price declines. It shows the
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s’ interest in the trading asset. If the indicator increases,
the price is rising compared to the previous period. It means that the
number of [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s and the amount of trades are rising, and the trend
is likely to continue.

 **Calculation formula:**

Force Index = Volume(i) * (МА(N,i) - MA(N,i-1))

Volume(i) is the trading volume of the current candlestick. MA(N,i) is
the moving average of the current candlestick for period N. MA(N,i-1) is
the moving average of the previous candlestick. You can also specify the
MA type and the price type in the Force Index index.

 **The Force Index is suitable for:**

  * Trend following strategies. It helps to determine the moments of trend strengthening, potential points of the trend end. The FI confirms the trend strength, spots corrections; therefore, it could be used in swing trading.
  * Timeframes of М30-Н1 and longer.
  * Trading in the stock market, equities, futures, [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/). It is rarely applied to Forex trading, as there are no data on real volumes on the OTC market.

The Force Index indicator could be recommended to professional stock
traders.

### Entry indicators

#### Fibonacci retracement

 **Category:** leading

[Fibonacci retracement][23] levels are the support and resistance levels
that indicate the end of a local correction and the return to the main
trend. The calculation is based on the statistical patterns and the
psychology of the majority.

 **Calculation formula:** The indicator is based on the golden ratio
principle. The grid is built between the local high and low; the
distance accounts for 100%. The section is divided into zones separated
by levels from 23.6% to 76.4%. These are the golden ratio levels.

 **Example of application:**

The Fibonacci grid is placed according to points 1 and 2. The first
counter-trend movement breaks through point 3 (level 0.236), but the
trend resumes almost immediately. We can set a stop loss at a level a
little lower than the 50% level. The second correction ends at point 4
(0.382), this level is one of the key ones. Here, if the trend turned
up, one could have added up to the trade. The price goes up, the take-
profits for 50% of both trades are set at the 0% level. The remaining
50% are protected with a trailing stop corresponding to the distance
between points 0.236 and 0%.

 **The Fibo indicator is suitable for:**

  * Scalping and swing trading. Orders are put when the steady trend resumes after a correction. It is also good in trend-following strategies, the tool spots the trend reversal when the correction exceeds 50% of the range.
  * Any timeframes. The tool is better at determining the entry and exit points in the H1 timeframes and longer ones, where the distance between the closest levels is at least 8-10 pips. The market analysis can be performed in any timeframes.
  * Any assets. The Fibo levels are often used in trading currency pairs, cryptocurrencies, and stock assets.

The Fibonacci retracements indicator can serve both as a primary tool in
a trading system and a complementary indicator to confirm the signals
and predict future price movements. It is often used as a forecasting
indicator. The Fibo indicators are among the best trading indicators
recommended to [beginners](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-for-beginners/).

> Note that there is the Auto Fib Retracement indicator among the built-
in tools in the LiteForex trading terminal. It automatically builds the
Fibonacci retracement levels according to the most recent highs and lows
and updates them when a new price extreme appears. It is good to
identify the support and resistance levels, monitor the change in the
retracement levels, and so on.

### Forex price extremes indicators

The price extremes indicators Forex are complementary tools, determining
potential trend reversal points. They effectively complement the graphic
chart analysis, highlighting the primary highs and lows to build key
levels. Such trading indicators are used to draw the support and
resistance levels and determine the potential trend pivot points.

#### Pivot Point

 **Category:** complementary ****

In classical interpretation, the indicator determines the potential
trend reversal points. The Pivot Point indicator is used to visually
identify the key levels and the levels to set stop loss and take profit.

 **Calculation formula:** the indicator determines the most important
price extreme values for a period specified in the settings.

 **Example of application:**

 ****

The indicator displays the extreme price values in the chart. You can
reduce the number of values in the settings and leave only the key
values. The Pivot Point is used to draw the support and resistance
levels, a quick scan of the price range.

The Pivot Point is suitable for:

  * Any assets. It is equally efficient in trading currency pairs, cryptocurrencies, and stock assets.
  * Any timeframes. It is an information indicator, so timeframes do not matter.
  * Any [trading strategies](https://www.fintechee.com/forex-trading-strategies/). It works both in scalping and long-term strategies.

The Pivot Point can be recommended to traders of any level of skills.
This is an information, complementary tool that fits well with any
technical indicators.

#### Support and resistance

 **Category:** complementary

The Support and Resistance indicator draws the key levels where the
trend could reverse.

 **Calculation formula:** the Support and Resistance indicator is based
on Bill Williams’s [Fractals](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/fractals.html) indicator, which identifies a Fractal
pattern as a sequence of 5 candlesticks, where the middle candlestick is
the highest/lowest compared to the previous and the following bars.

 **The indicator is suitable for:**

  * Any type of strategy. It draws horizontal levels across the key highs and lows. It helps to define the optimal levels to set the market and pending orders, take profits and stop-losses.
  * Any trading assets, Forex and stock exchange.
  * Any timeframes. It sends more accurate signals in the timeframes of М15-М30, where there is less market noise, and price swings are not that sharp.

The support and resistance indicator doesn’t require any specific
knowledge or experience, so it is suitable for all traders. It will be
of use to traders who prefer graphic analysis.

## Best Indicators for Day Trading

Day trading means trading within one day, and closing positions before
the swap is charged. Day trading also includes short-term scalping, but
most commonly, it means trading timeframes of М15-Н1, with the position
holding time up a few hours.

 **Best intraday trading indicators:**

  *  **Trend following indicators**. Alligator, the Ichimoku cloud, moving averages, ADX, and so on. All trend indicators will work in day trading; they will indicate the potential sideways trend start and beginning of a trending movement. Such tools will help you make profits from a movement of several candlesticks.
  *  **Channel indicators.** [Bollinger Bands](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/bollinger-bands.html), Keltner Channel, Donchian Channels. In the timeframes of М30-Н1, traders have time for analysis, the influence of the market noise is eliminated. Channel indicators send more accurate signals in the medium-term timeframes.
  *  **Oscillators**. MACD, RSI, CCI, and stochastic are utilized in combination with trend indicators to get stronger signals.
  *  **Information indicators**. ZigZag, Market Sentiment, volatility indicators. These are complementary tools indicating the expected trend direction and strength.

The advantage of intraday trading is that almost all indicators can be
used in such a type of trading strategy, provided the settings are
[optimize](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/17/added-genetic-algorithm-for-trading/)d.

Less commonly, day trading is interpreted as trading in the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/)
timeframe, which could be referred to as a long-term trading strategy.
The same trend following indicators do well in the D1 timeframes. There
are a few notes:

  * Information indicators perform worse in the D1 timeframes. The market Sentiment indicator is efficient in a short-term period, as long-term forecasts are strongly influenced by fundamental factors.
  * There are more false signals sent by oscillators.

## Best Indicators for Stock Trading

 **Options for trading financial instruments: stocks CFDs, and
equities.**

  1.  **Stocks CFDs**. CFDs are traded in the Forex market, which is the OTC market. There can be used the same indicators as in trading currency pairs. The feature of the stock market is longer trends, compared to currencies, and deeper drawdowns. Therefore, you could focus on trend indicators and important levels, for example, the Fibonacci retracements and extensions. [Parabolic SAR](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/parabolic-sar.html), MACD, Alligator perform quite well in trading individual stocks CFDs.
  2.  **Equities**. Trading securities in a stock exchange. Here, in addition to standard tools, you can use volume indicators:
    * **VWAP –** volume-weighted average price. It indicates more accurately averaged prices considering the trade volume of each candlestick.
    *  **On Balance Volume** indicates averaged cumulative volume for a specific period.

In the stock market, these indicators reflect the real numbers and
volumes of trades. In Forex, volume indicators show only the number of
ticks, the number of price changes, as you can obtain total statistics
in the OTC market. So, volume indicators are not efficient in trading
CFDs.

## Best Indicators for Swing Trading

Swing trading is a short-term strategy based on the idea to put an order
in the trend direction at the end of the correction.

 **The algorithm of a swing trading system:**

  * Expect the beginning of the trend. The trend is best to recognize when the sideways trend is finished. The price reversal is less commonly used as a signal.
  * Expect the first price reversal. Once the counter-trend movement ends, and the price returns to the trend, enter a trade.
  * Close the position in two steps. Take 50% of the profit when the price reaches the most recent high or low, depending on the trade direction. Protect the remaining 50% with trailing stop or exit the trade when the next correction starts.

 **Best indicators for swing trading.**

  * Fibo retracement levels. The indicator builds the key levels where the trend could reverse.
  * ADX. The ADX indicator shows the strength of bulls and bears; it can indicate an acceleration or a slowdown of the price movement.
  * Oscillators like CCI, RSI, stochastic. They show the market saturation with buy or sell volumes (overbought and oversold states). For example, a downward correction occurs in the uptrend, and oscillators are in the overbought zone. In this case, one should not put an order at the correction end as the price can continue moving down.

You can learn more about swing trading systems, indicators, and signals
in the article devoted to [swing trading][24].

## Best Indicators for Option Trading

There are two types of [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/): binary [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) and stock [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/).
Trading binary [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) is a simplified version of the CFD trading when
the trader should predict if the future price will be up or down
relative to the current values. Stock [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) are security derivatives.

1\. Binary [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/). The choice of the instrument depends on the trading
system. In general, you can use the same indicators as in Forex trading.

The best indicators for [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) trading:

  * Moving Averages. The combination of moving averages can be used in almost any trading strategy, from swing trading to long-term analysis. A good example of the MA combination is the Alligator.
  * Oscillators: stochastic, RSI, CCI. They are used to confirm the trend.

2\. Stock [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/). There will work indicators suitable for stock
trading.

You can also use:

  * TD Sequential. It is a trend trading indicator that spots reversal patterns and predicts a long-term trend.
  * Money Flow Index. This is a volume indicator similar to the RSI.
  * PVT. This is another volume indicator, mostly employed in the stock market.

## Best Indicators for Scalping

Scalping is short-term high-frequency trading, which means entering many
trades and holding them for a few minutes. The trading timeframes are
M5-M15, minimum spreads, and high volatility are important for a
scalper. The trend direction hardly matters, a scalper quickly exits a
trade and enters an opposite one if the price goes in the opposite
direction. It is possible to trade in a sideways trend if the price
amplitude in the range allows covering spread.

Scalping indicators should be leading, ignore the price noise, and
should not repaint.

 **Best Forex indicators for scalping:**

  * Spread indicator. Spread is important for a scalper. The narrower is the spread, the sooner the trader can close a position, making profits from any price movement. The spread indicator shows the spread widening amid the fundamental volatility.
  * Heiken Ashi chart. ****The chart eliminates the market noise, smooths the price swings, and is more convenient.
  * The Ichimoku cloud. This indicator measures the trend strength and direction. It signals trading flat, sends rare but accurate signals.

You can learn more about scalping [trading strategies](https://www.fintechee.com/forex-trading-strategies/) and indicators in
the article devoted to [scalping in Forex][25].

## Best Indicators for Crypto Trading

Crypto trading means trading cryptocurrencies against the USD. The
feature of the cryptocurrency market:

  * High volatility – 2%-3% per day is the norm.
  * High spread, slippages.
  * High sensitivity to fundamental factors.

Indicators, based on mathematical [algorithms](https://www.fintechee.com/algorithms-for-trading/), perform worse in the
cryptocurrency market than in trading currency pairs. Any pattern or
regularity could be broken by fundamental factors, market-makers’
actions, statements of the regulators and central banks, media people.

 **Best Forex indicators for cryptocurrency trading:**

  *  **Fibonacci levels, support/resistance levels, chart patterns**. Since cryptocurrency quotes are largely driven by fundamental factors and mass psychology, indicators analyzing traders’ behaviour work better.
  *  **Market sentiment indicators.** It shows the majority opinion, whether the market is bullish or bearish.
  *  **Spread indicator.** The tool helps not to miss the beginning of the spread widening due to the growth of volatility.

One can well apply basic technical indicators, but the signals should be
confirmed with fundamental and chart analysis.
