Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 11.08.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

The oil upward correction continues. Yesterday, as part of this
correction, the Intermediary Zone 68.02 - 67.75 was tested.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

The oil upward correction continues. Yesterday, as part of this
correction, the Intermediary Zone 68.02 - 67.75 was tested. It cannot
yet be said that the zone has been broken out, so keep looking for sales
according to the pattern. The sales target will be the August 9 low.

To enter oil purchases, it is required to break out level 69.76 or form
a new uptrend consisting of at least two highs and two lows, each of
which is higher than the previous one.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

Sell according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 68.02 - 67.75.
TakeProfit: 65.30. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

Yesterday, the gold price didn't break out the Intermediary Zone 1730 -
1727, despite the update of the August 9 local low. This means that the
short-term uptrend continues with the target in the Gold Zone 1755 -
1753.

The chart shows that a false breakout of level 1724 has formed. It
serves as a signal to enter long trades. Today consider gold purchases
from the Intermediary Zone with a stop beyond yesterday's low.

The breakout of level 1724 and price consolidation below are required to
enter gold sales.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

Buy in Intermediary Zone 1730 - 1727. TakeProfit: Gold Zone 1755 - 1753.
StopLoss: 1717.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

The euro is testing the Target Zone 1.1732 - 1.1715 and is trying to
break it out. If successful, the next target of the downtrend will be
the Gold Zone 1.1644 - 1.1635.

The task of traders using the margin zones' methodology in trading is to
look for euro sales on correction at strong resistance levels. The
Additional Zone 1.1758 - 1.1754 and the Intermediary Zone 1.1806 -
1.1798 are strong resistances. Focus on today's low as a target.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

  1. Sell according to the pattern in Additional Zone 1.1758 - 1.1754. TakeProfit: 1.1711. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. Sell according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 1.1806 - 1.1798. TakeProfit: 1.1711. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.
