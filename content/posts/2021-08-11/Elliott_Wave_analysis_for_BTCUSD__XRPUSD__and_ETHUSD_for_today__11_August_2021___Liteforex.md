Short-term analysis for BTCUSD, XRPUSD, and ETHUSD for 11.08.2021Roman
Onegin

Dear readers,

Based on the Elliott wave analysis, I've prepared a short-term forecast
for Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. Also, I've provided trading
recommendations and entry points for each cryptocurrency pair.

The three cryptocurrency pairs are enjoying bullish momentum and are
likely to reach new highs.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott Wave analysis for Bitcoin

The ultimate part of the ascending correction [B] -- impulse (C) --
continues developing. The impulse wave (C) is made of sub-waves 1-2-3-4,
and the ultimate sub-wave 5 is developing at the moment. The sub-waves
[1]-[2]-[3]-[4] might have fully formed, so the Bitcoin price is
expected to grow to the level of 49991.00 in the final sub-wave [5]. In
that scenario, long positions can be considered.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] for today:

Buy 45786.50, TP 49991.00

## Elliott Wave analysis for Ripple

The Ripple price is currently located in the ultimate part of a big
linking wave (X), which is building an ascending impulse wave C. Four
fifths of wave C have already formed. Have a look at the final sub-wave
[5], which is likely to be a simple impulse. Its sub-waves (1) and (2)
are completed, and sub-wave (3) is nearing completion. The price is
highly likely to rise to 0.913 and then slightly pull back in correction
(4), as shown in the chart.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] for today:

Buy 0.877, TP 0.913

## Elliott Wave analysis for Ethereum

The market continues rising in a bullish impulse wave. Sub-waves
(1)-(2)-(3)-(4) have formed for now. Sub-wave (5) is developing at the
moment as an impulse as well. Its sub-wave 3 appears to be developing.
It includes sub-waves of a smaller degree [1]-[2]-[3]-[4]-[5]. The price
will most likely rise to 3280.00 in the ultimate sub-wave [5] and then
slightly pull back in corrective wave 4, as shown in the chart.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] for today:

Buy 3169.60, TP 3280.00
