Greenback: no use in resisting! Forecast for AUDUSD, USDJPY, and USDNOK
as of 11.08.2021Dmitri Demidenko

The dollar rate is determined by central-bank [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), and also by the
oil and stock markets as they measure global and US economic health.
Let’s discuss that and make a trading plan for [AUDUSD][1], [USDJPY][2],
and [USDNOK][3]

## Monthly fundamental forecast for G10 currencies

After the [S&P 500][4]'s 45th record closing high and 18% growth in
2021, a correction by 5%-10% for the rest of the year isn't surprising.
Some bullish influence is already factored in stock prices, whereas the
fiscal stimulus withdrawal and expectations of central-bank [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
normalization and Treasury yield growth may lead to a pullback.
According to the Bank of America, the stock market may remain weak for
6-12 months. How will that affect Forex?

I have already [noted][5] that the USD index became oversensitive to
[the S&P 500][4]/[WTI][6] ratio, which is not surprising: the US stock
market and oil measure the health of the US and the global economies,
respectively. Their rally is bad [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) for the greenback. In such times,
it's important to know who assumes the role of global GDP growth driver.
If that's China, proxies for China -- the Aussie and the NZ dollar --
grow popular. If that's the eurozone, European currencies hold high the
banner, the euro being their leader.

US stock indexes' fall and the [WTI][6]'s rally are highly unlikely to
be happening simultaneously as the US is most often the leader of the
global economic growth, and its high demand for oil pushes oil quotes
up. Conversely, the [S&P 500][4]'s rally and an oil correction, which
happened in August, are the reason for buying the greenback. It's here
that the US exclusivity factor comes in: when the US GDP growth exceeds
its global counterpart, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s start buying out US securities like
hot cakes.

How will the US stock market's pullback and its subsequent move to
medium-term consolidation combined with the [WTI][6] price stabilization
affect USD pairs? That scenario is very likely to unfold in the next 1-3
months.

At the end of 2020, Bloomberg parsed G10 currencies' sensitivity to
changes in the USD index over the past 12 months. According to that
analysis, Scandinavian currencies, the Australian dollar, and the NZ
dollar will fall the fastest against the greenback. The loonie will be
the least affected.

Despite the slump in oil prices and Brexit aftershocks, the CAD and the
pound sterling remain Forex favorites as their central banks intend to
normalize policies.

At the same time, a deteriorating COVID situation, lockdowns, and GDP
slowdowns, including China's one, give a reason for selling the
[AUDUSD][1] in the direction of 0.72. The [S&P 500][4]'s correction
might not help the yen out as it will most likely result from growing
bond yields. So, consider [building up longs][5] in the [USDJPY][2]
after a breakout of resistance at 110.9. Long positions in the
[USDNOK][3] look quite appealing as the party in power might lose the
election in Norway in September.
