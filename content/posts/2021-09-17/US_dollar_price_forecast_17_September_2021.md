Dollar forces things. Forecast as of 17.09.2021Dmitri Demidenko

Surprisingly, the [S&P 500][1] is down amid a strong report on the US
economic data. The US equity market reacts to the expectations of a soon
tapering of the QE. Should [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s be worried? Let us discuss the
Forex outlook and make up a [EURUSD][2] trading plan.

## Weekly US dollar fundamental forecast

A strong report on the US retail sales in August increased the
likelihood that the Fed will announce the tapering of the $120-billion
quantitative easing program at the meeting on September 21-22. Investors
were encouraged to sell securities. The huge monetary stimulus supported
the unprecedented rally of the [S&P 500][1] in 2020-2021, holding the
Treasury yields at a low level. Is it time to sell the fact?

Consumption accounts for about 70% of the US GDP, and if retail sales,
instead of collapsing by 0.8%, according to forecasts by Bloomberg
experts, unexpectedly soar by 0.7% M-oM, then the US economy is strong.
Although skeptics argue that the retail surge is temporary, it increases
the chance of scaling back the QE in the near future.

Better sooner than later. The stock market is down, the Treasury yields
are up, the derivatives market has raised the chance of the federal
funds rate hike in December 2022 from 51% to 55%. Therefore, the Fed is
growing more likely to announce monetary tightening at the FOMC
September meeting. Although the fall in the [S&P 500][1] looks
insignificant (the stock index finished its 20th day in a row unchanged
by more than 1%, which is the longest streak from October 2019 to
January 2020), it is alarming. The current values ​​of the stock market
are clearly higher than its fundamental estimates, which increases the
likelihood of a correction and contributes to an increase in demand for
safe-haven assets, including the US dollar.

### Dynamics of [S&P 500][1] and its fundamental estimates

Despite the success of the greenback ahead of the September FOMC
meeting, you need to understand that, firstly, the verdict on tapering
the quantitative easing program has not yet been passed; second, even a
cutback in asset purchases shouldn't seriously scare [S&P 500][1] bulls.
Indeed, if one bad employment and inflation report does not force the
Fed to backtrack from normalizing monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), why should one single
retail sales report push the central bank to take action? It is unknown
how the battle between the hawks and doves will end on September 21-22,
and if so, was it too early for [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s to start selling [EURUSD][2]?

Withdrawing the QE is not a reason to sell US stocks. Even if the Fed
does not buy Treasuries under the program, it will continue to reinvest
the proceeds from the bonds to be redeemed. At the same time,
maintaining the central bank’s balance at a level above $8 trillion is
good [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) for risky assets. Furthermore, if the US economy is stronger
than expected, why would stock indexes fall?

### Weekly[ EURUSD][3] trading plan

I suppose the [EURUSD][2] bears were too early to sell the pair, being
confident that the Fed would announce QE tapering in September. The
verdict has not yet been passed. Understanding this will increase the
risks of short-term consolidation. What will be its range? 1.177-1.1845?
1.1755-1.1830? Or 1.1715-1.1790? The coming days will answer this
question. The first clue could be the close of the week above or below
1.179.
