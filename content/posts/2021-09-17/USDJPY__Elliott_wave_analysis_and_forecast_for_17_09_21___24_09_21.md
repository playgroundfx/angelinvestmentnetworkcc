USDJPY: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 17.09.21 – 24.09.21Alex
Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 110.46 with a target of 107.16 – 106.07.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
110.46 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 111.72 –
113.50.

 **Analysis:** Daily chart: apparently, a descending correction of
larger degree finished forming as wave B, and wave С started developing,
with the first wave (1) of С forming inside.

The third wave of smaller degree 3 of (1) continues developing on the H4
chart, with wave i of 3 formed and a downside correction developing as
wave ii of 3 inside. Wave (с) of ii appears to be unfolding on the H1
chart, with wave ii of (с) completed and wave iii of (c) forming as part
of it. If the presumption is correct, the pair will continue to drop to
the levels of 107.16 – 106.07. The level of 110.46 is critical in this
scenario as a breakout will enable the pair to continue growing to the
levels of 111.72 – 113.50.
