How to Invest EUR/USD – Best Forex StrategiesDmitri Demidenko

Today, I will deal with the most popular Forex trading asset – the EUR
USD pair. We shall dive into the [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) of EUR/USD, explore modern
trends, and have a look at euro-dollar [trading strategies](https://www.fintechee.com/forex-trading-strategies/). This overview
will be of interest to both [beginners](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-for-beginners/) and professionals!

The article covers the following subjects:

## The EUR/USD Pair Overview

The [EURUSD][1] pair is the most popular [Forex trading](https://www.fintechee.com/forex-trading-strategies/) asset, also known
as the major currency pair, which is justified. Trading the EUR/USD
forex pair accounted for almost a quarter of all FX trades, according to
the BIS survey. Its main competitors, USDJPY and GBPUSD, account for
about 13% and 9%. Therefore, the EUR/USD is the most traded pair.

The popularity of the EUR/USD currency pair is fueled by high media
attention and [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s’ demand. From 2016 to 2019, the Forex [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/)
trading volume increased from $5.1 trillion to $6.6 trillion, while the
share of EURUSD increased by almost 1%. It's about $600 billion!

The USD [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) began after the proclamation of the United States’
independence in 1776 when the dollar became the local currency. The
influence of the greenback, as the dollar is called because of its
color, increased significantly after World War II. The British pound
could not compete with the dollar due to the weakness of the UK economy.
For a long time, Europe had been hatching a design to create a currency
that would outperform the US dollar. As a result, in 1999, the euro
emerged – a single currency for 19 member countries of the Eurozone.

A lot of time has passed since then. [Trading the US dollar][2] is
dominant in the Forex market. According to the IMF data, the greenback’s
share in the FX reserves of the world’s central banks as of December
2020 is 59.5%, the share of the euro is 20.6%. However, we cannot say
that the single European currency is not a competitor to the US dollar.
Before the euro introduction, the share of the US dollar exceeded 71%.

### EUR/USD trend in 1999-2021

The EURUSD features quite high volatility. In the beginning, the EUR/USD
currency pair was trading below parity. However, starting from 2022, the
euro has never been below $1. The euro-dollar all-time low is 0.82; the
record high is close to 1.604.

## EURUSD Lately Trends EUR/USD

In 2020, the global economy faced a recession, which lasted for only two
months. Because of the panic in financial markets, the demand for the
greenback sharply increased. As a result, the EURUSD dropped to a level
of 1.064, the lowest since April 2017 (1).

Central banks launched colossal monetary incentives of trillions of
dollars to support their economies. The Fed was even called crazy
because of a sharp federal funds rate cut from 1.75% to 0 and the start
of the QE at a monthly pace of $120 billion. The Federal Reserve balance
sheet was growing rapidly, approaching $9 trillion, and the US dollar
weakened against a basket of major currencies. In particular, the euro,
from January to March, was almost 16% up and reached $1.234 (2).

### EUR/USD trend in 2020-2021

In late 2020, the euro was expected to be trading up. Many banks
suggested the EURUSD should have exceeded 1.25 in 2021. Some aggressive
bulls expected the euro around $1.3. In reality, things turned out to be
different. Due to the slow vaccination in the EU, which turned into new
lockdowns and a double recession, the euro collapsed to 1.1705 (3).

Thanks to vaccines, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s became reassured in the global economic
recovery. Furthermore, the EURUSD buyers were again encouraged to invest
in Euro Dollar by a successful vaccination campaign in the EU and the
Fed’s unwillingness to recognize a surge in US inflation. The pair was
up to 1.226 in late May (4). Bulls again were aiming at 1.25, but the
FOMC June projection broke the uptrend again. The Fed started talking
about a potential federal funds rate hike in 2022, which encouraged
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s to buy the US dollar.

## Factors Moving the Euro / US Dollar Currency Pair

The EUR/USD trend depends on what stage of the cycle the global economy
is. During a recession, the demand for safe-haven assets, including the
US dollar, increases. As a result, the euro dollar goes down.

During a recovery from recession, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are not that focused on
preserving the money. Retail [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s search for ways to multiply the
deposit. At this stage, the fundamentals driving the EUR/USD currency
pair are the GDP growth rates and the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of central banks.

A strong economy is a strong currency. The rapid rebound of GDP after
the recession is a reason to buy securities of the country. In
particular, the belief that the US economy will fully recover from the
2020 recession in the second quarter of 2021 and exceed its potential
level in 2022 contributed to the S&P 500 rally by 18% from January to
early August. As a result of the capital inflow into the US stock
market, the US dollar was strengthening.

The GDP rate is a reliable indicator but, unfortunately, lagging. The
GDP report is published a month or month and a half after the end of the
quarter. Therefore, it is very difficult to determine whose economy is
growing faster at a particular time, which doesn’t provide a clear
picture of the current economic situation to [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s. That is why
forex traders have to monitor some leading indicators, such as the US
and Eurozone PMIs.

 **Dynamics of US PMI and GDP**

The more the economy heats, the more likely the central bank to phase
out the quantitative easing program and hike the interest rates. As a
result, the assets denominated in the local currency grow more
attractively. That is why the US dollar is currently strengthening
against a basket of major currencies.

To understand the Fed’s intentions, one should track such indicators as
inflation and unemployment rate. When these indicators reach the
thresholds set by the Fed, the central bank starts scaling back monetary
stimulus. In this case, the greenback will grow in value.

Speeches of central banks representatives are important in forecasting
the [EUR/USD][1] exchange rate. The officials’ comments give a clue on
how the central banks’ policies could change, and [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s could
develop [trading strategies](https://www.fintechee.com/forex-trading-strategies/) based on this.

pair and study all the factors influencing the pair’s quotes. Follow my

## Best Time to Day Trade EUR/USD

You can trade Forex round the clock, at any time when it is convenient
for you. The Forex market operates 24 hours a day from Monday till
Friday.

0:00-9:00 UTC – Asian trading session

07:00-16:00 UTC – European trading session

13:30-22:30 UTC – American trading session

The volume of transactions usually increases during the crossover of
several trading sessions: from 7:00 UTC to 9:00 UTC and from 12:30 UTC
to 16:00 UTC, when Asians close intraday positions, and Europeans, on
the contrary, enter the market. The same is true for the crossover of
European late afternoon and New York morning trading hours is normally
the most active.

According to BIS research, London is the major trading centre. In 2019,
it accounted for 43% of all Forex trader activity. The capital of the UK
is the center of the European session where EURUSD, GBPUSD, USDCHF,
EURGBP, and EURCHF are mostly traded.

The second largest trading centre is New York, the share of which in the
total volume of Forex transactions is 17%. Other trading centres are
Singapore (7.3%), Hong Kong (6.7%), and Tokyo (6.1%). Americans prefer
to trade the Euro Dollar, USDCAD, and other dollar pairs. The Asian
trading session has its favorites – the USDJPY currency pair, as well as
AUDUSD, AUDJPY, NZDUSD, NZDJPY, and others.

What is the [best time](https://www.fixpro.org/post/forex-best-time-to-trade/) to trade? If you are not going to invest a billion
dollars in one trade, liquidity is not a problem. Increased volatility
is observed during the crossovers of trading sessions. At that time, the
[news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) is actively published. In general, it all depends on the EUR/USD
investing strategy that you apply.

## EURUSD Technical Analysis

Freedom of creation – what could be better? EURUSD is a highly liquid
financial instrument, so you can use absolutely any technical analysis
method to predict the future price of EUR/USD. Are you a fan of Price
Action? No problem! Do what you like – discover the repeating chart
patterns and use them to determine entry points. Are you fond of
indicators? You can apply any reliable indicator, MACD, RSI, Stochastic,
or ADX. Everything will work in trading EURUSD.

Do you prefer the market profile, VSA, Elliott wave analysis, Keltner
channels, or margin zones? Any ideas within these areas can be
implemented on the euro dollar chart in MetaTrader. The trading approach
should satisfy the trader and yield a positive result. Remember, every
pip contributes to your deposit.

## EUR/USD Forex Trading Strategies

In Forex trading, only strict adherence to the trading system rules
allows one to save the deposit and increase the capital. Below, I will
analyse several [trading strategies](https://www.fintechee.com/forex-trading-strategies/) that have proved to be profitable
among Forex traders. Examples here refer to day trading, but the
strategies will work in intraday trading as well.

### Moving Average Crossovers

Moving Averages are a simple and efficient tool for trading Forex. When
the MAs frequently cross the EURUSD chart, it means consolidation.
Otherwise, if the MAs rarely meet with the price chart, it signals a
clear trend. During such a period, there is an opportunity to trade
EUR/USD on the continuation of the ongoing trend.

#### Rules to buy the EURUSD:

  1. The trend is up.

  2. The price chart crosses the 14-day moving average downside.

  3. The breakout bar or candlestick closes above the EMA-14.

  4. Set a buy order at the high of the breakout bar.

#### Rules to sell the EURUSD:

  1. The trend is down.

  2. The price chart crosses the 14-day moving average upside.

  3. The breakout bar closes below the EMA-14.

  4. The sell price is at the low of the breakout bar.

EURUSD [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) chart:

As you see from the USD price chart, the strategy is successful amid a
clear trend. If the trend is broken, a trader will face a loss. There
should be a stop loss to ensure negative balance protection.

### Pullback and Breakout

Traders often say that the market is boring when it is trading flat
(consolidation). In fact, one should pay much attention to the Forex
market when there is not a huge range of price fluctuations. Experienced
traders know that big traders (funds, institutional [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s) get in
the game when the market seems to be trading flat and there is little
trading activity. As a result, there emerges a general trend.

#### Conditions to buy the EURUSD:

  1. Consolidation (sideways trend).

  2. Price tests the channel’s upper border and rolls back.

  3. Price retests the upper level after 2-5 bars and closes above the upper border of the consolidation range.

  4. Enter a long at the breakout level or at the level of the breakout bar’s close.

#### Conditions to sell the EURUSD:

  1. Consolidation.

  2. Price tests the lower border of the channel and rolls back.

  3. Price retests the lower level after 2-5 bars and closes below the lower border of the consolidation range.

  4. Enter a short at the breakout level or at the level of the breakout bar’s close.

 **EURUSD [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) chart:**

After the price goes beyond the consolidation range, it often retests
it, goes back to the border of the range. In this case, there appears
another entry point. In our example, this happens in the second case.

### Follow planned events

Large traders always plan their actions. Banks and hedge funds
understand that they are not the only participants in the market. A
strong opponent can appear at any moment. Therefore, all trading
decisions must be justified. Investment ideas are often based on the
fundamental analysis of the market. In this context, [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) trading takes
on a special character.

Important events planned in the economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) include reports on
inflation, employment, GDP, PMI, meetings of the ECB and the Fed, as
well as the presidential elections in the USA or parliamentary elections
in the EU countries. All these planned events could result in radical
EURUSD price movements.

 **Daily EURUSD chart:**

  1. In early March, the Fed Chair didn’t express any concern about the S&P 500 drop. Investors were puzzled, as they believed that the central bank should spare no effort to support the US equity market. Therefore, the demand for safe havens surged, and the EURUSD crashed.

  2. In early May, a weak reading of the employment data encouraged the EURUSD bulls to go ahead. The indicator was almost four times less than Bloomberg experts expected.

  3. In mid-June, the Fed signaled a possible federal funds rate hike in 2022, and the euro uptrend was broken.

If trade on the [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/), you should observe the following rules:

  1. If the EURUSD starts consolidation ahead of an important event, you should put a buy order above the upper border of the consolidation range, a sell order – below the lower border. 

  2. If the forex pair is rising or falling a few days before an important report publication or a central bank’s meeting, one could follow the ‘buy the [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/), sell the facts’ principle. 

  3. A stop-loss will limit the potential loss. A stop loss is necessary for balance protection because the volatility increases when the important [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) releases.

## EUR/USD CFD Trading

The international foreign exchange market has been rapidly evolving
since the abolition of the Gold Standard 50 years ago. Nonetheless, a
retail [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) couldn’t enter Forex for a long time. The reason is the
high minimum lot price of $100,000, which only banks and investment
could afford. The advent of CFDs or Contracts for Difference in the
1990s allowed individual [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s to enter the Forex market.

If a trader is interested in the differences in the exchange rate of
EUR/USD  rather than in the currency itself, why enter a trade for
$100,000? Suppose you have a couple of US dollars, preferably $1000, on
your account. Any ECN or another Forex broker provides 1:100 leverage,
and you can buy EURUSD at the rate of 1.17. The growth of the eur usd
forex pair quotes to 1.18 will allow you to double your capital. If the
euro is down to $1.16, you will lose your money. Individual traders
usually apply a Meta Trader platform, MT4 or MT5, or another trading
platform.

CFD trading means quite a risk, but the potential profit is worth it!

## EUR/USD Trading Tips

  * A necessary condition to buy EUR vs USD in the long term is the sync trends in the global economy. If the US GDP features a robust growth, but China and the euro area face problems, sell the pair. 

  * Monitor the commodity and stock markets. If the S&P 500 and oil are rallying up simultaneously, it is a reason to buy the Euro versus US Dollar. If the stock index is growing and the black stuff is falling in value, or both financial assets are depreciating, it is relevant to sell the EURUSD. 

  * Study the [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) of the financial asset’s quotes. An example that took place in the past may emerge in the future as a potential EUR/USD price movement. 

  * Use moving averages in trading the EUR/USD to determine the current market state. If the MAs often cross the EURUSD chart, the market is trading flat. If the price chart is above the EMA, the trend is bullish; if the price is below the indicator, the underlying trend is bearish.

  * Do not try to use all popular [trading strategies](https://www.fintechee.com/forex-trading-strategies/); you’d better find the one that suits you best. 

  * Always observe the rules of your trading system.

## Key takeaways

Therefore, you can make quite a profit from trading the EURUSD. Choose
the most suitable trading system for you, monitor central banks’
statements and the economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/). And most importantly, always
learn! You will become a successful trader if you understand the market
processes.

Take into account Asian, European and American trading sessions.
Remember factors driving the currency rates, technical analysis, and
[trading strategies](https://www.fintechee.com/forex-trading-strategies/). Distinguish between trading flat and a trending
market. Bear in mind that general trends of EUR/USD could change at any
time. Study the fundamentals and increase your knowledge base. I wish
you success on your way to professional Forex trading!
