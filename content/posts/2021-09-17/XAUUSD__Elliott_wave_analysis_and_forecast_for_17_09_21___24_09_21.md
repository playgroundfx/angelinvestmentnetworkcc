XAUUSD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 17.09.21 – 24.09.21Alex
Geuta

 **Main scenario:** long positions will be relevant above the level of
1676.71 with a target of  1915.00 – 2075.27 once a correction has
formed.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
1676.71 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of
1602.20 – 1490.37.

 **Analysis:** an ascending third wave of larger degree (3) is formed on
the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) chart, and a descending correction developed as the fourth
wave (4), supposedly. Apparently, the fifth wave (5) started forming on
the H4 chart, with wave 1 of (5) forming inside. The first counter-trend
wave of smaller degree i of 1 is formed on the H1 chart, and a local
correction is nearing completion as wave ii of 1. If the presumption is
correct, the pair will continue to rise to the levels of 1915.00 –
2075.27 once the correction is over. The level of 1676.71 is critical in
this scenario as a breakout will enable the pair to continue declining
to the levels of 1602.20 – 1490.37.
