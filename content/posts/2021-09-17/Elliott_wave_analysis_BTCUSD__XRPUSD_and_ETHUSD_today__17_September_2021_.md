Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 17.09.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

Cryptocurrency pairs are declining in the third impulse waves.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

The BTCUSD market continues forming the impulse down wave. Corrective
wave 2 has completed as a triple combination [W]-[X]-[Y]-[X]-[Z]. The
downtrend should continue over the next few days. The price will
continue falling in wave 3 to a level below 41800.00. One could enter
short trades in the current situation.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Sell 48028.50, TP 41800.00

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

It is clear from the most recent section of the XRPUSD price chart that
the first two sub-waves 1 and 2 of the new bearish impulse have
completed. The market is declining in sub-wave 3. Sub-waves [1]-[2] seem
to have completed, and the price should continue falling in the
remaining three sub-waves to a level below 0.950. Therefore, one could
enter sell trades in the current situation.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] **** today:

Sell 1.097, TP 0.950

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

There is developing the new down wave as a five-wave impulse 1-2-3-4-5.
Corrective wave 2 must have completed as a double three [W]-[X]-[Y].
There is developing impulse 3. The Ethereum price should continue
falling in sub-wave to a level below 2895.00. One could enter sell
trades in the current situation.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Sell 3569.02, TP 2895.00
