Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 17.09.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

Yesterday, oil was trading in correction. The pattern “Micro-zone -
Additional Zone” yielded profits.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

Yesterday, oil was trading in correction. The pattern “Micro-zone -
Additional Zone” yielded profits. The test of the Additional Zone 71.60
- 71.47 led to a price rise and a retest of the resistance at 72.85 -
72.32. As long as this resistance is being held, there is no talk of a
further price rise.

The task of traders for today is to look for a buy pattern in the
Additional Zone with a target at level 72.67.

If the Additional Zone is broken out and the price consolidates lower,
then the price will go into a deeper correction with the target in the
Intermediary Zone 70.32 - 70.07.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

  1. Buy according to the pattern in Additional Zone 71.60 - 71.47. TakeProfit: 72.67. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. Buy according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 70.32 - 70.07. TakeProfit: 72.67. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

Yesterday, gold broke out not only the Target Zone 1792 - 1788, but also
the Gold Zone 1772 - 1770. As a result, prices reached the Target Zone 2
1751 - 1747 within a short-term downtrend.

Now the gold price is correcting to yesterday's fall and is approaching
the Intermediary Zone 1768 - 1765. The Intermediary Zone serves as the
border of the trend. First of all, after its test, look for a pattern to
sell gold with a target in the Target Zone 2.

To enter purchases and reverse the trend, traders need to break out the
Intermediary Zone and consolidate the price higher. In this case, the
target for purchases will be the upper Target Zone 1790 - 1786.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

Sell according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 1768 - 1765.
TakeProfit: Target Zone 2 1751 - 1747. StopLoss: according to the
pattern rules.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

The short-term euro downtrend yielded profits. As a result, the first
target for sales in the zone of 1.1867 - 1.1812 was reached. The second
target of the trend is the Target Zone 1.1733 - 1.1715.

Since the support level 1.1774 was broken out downside, it now serves as
a resistance. At the moment, the price is testing this level upside. If
resistance is held, the decline will continue with the target in the
Target Zone.

If level 1.1774 is broken out upside, then the price will reach the
Additional Zone 1.1799 - 1.1794 which serves as the next resistance
level.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

  1. Sell according to the pattern in the level of 1.1774. TakeProfit: Target Zone 1.1733 - 1.1715. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. Buy when level 1.1774 is broken out. TakeProfit: Additional Zone 1.1799 - 1.1794. StopLoss: 1.1765.
