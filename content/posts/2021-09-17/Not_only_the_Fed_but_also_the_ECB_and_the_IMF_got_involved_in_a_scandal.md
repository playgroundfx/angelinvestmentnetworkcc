Not only the Fed but also the ECB and the IMF got involved in a scandal

## Someone wants to earn money, and someone doesn't want the euro to
grow

Forex. Autumn. Time of scandals. One could think the life of financial
markets would become boring after Donald Trump's departure. However, a
sacred space is never empty. First, it was the Fed that picked up
Trump's banner and continued turning everything upside down. The ECB
and, finally, the IMF followed the example shortly. The managing
director of the IMF got involved in some strange business: she's accused
of altering reports during her time at the World Bank. Kristalina
Georgieva denies everything, of course. However, admitting the
allegation would be equal to admitting there's a vagrant dozing on your
career ladder.

A true woman knows [how to](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-trading-how-to/) make at least two things out of nothing: a
scandal and some salad. Internal audit reports revealed that the current
director of the IMF had been pressuring the World Bank's personnel to
boost China's [ranking](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/crypto-exchange-ranking/)s in an economic report when she was the Bank's
Chief Executive.  The methodology of those reports is so subjective and
inconsistent that the bank is ready to give up such publications in the
future. However, that's no longer important. Someone disgraced
themselves, just like the Fed's officials I wrote about last week. ​

There are two types of a person: gamblers and those who haven't tried
gambling yet. The story involving Boston Fed's Eric Rosengren and Dallas
Fed's Robert Kaplan continues. As the Fed values the US people's trust,
the ethics rules of investing in financial instruments will likely be
revised and toughened up for the Fed's high-[ranking](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/crypto-exchange-ranking/) officials.  That was
the Fed's official statement as it is concerned about its loss of
authority and will make every effort to prevent FOMC members from
trading.

Speculating in securities, any FOMC member sits inside a Trojan horse.
Its activity may undermine the trust in the Fed. There's just one thing
I can't understand, though: how can one sit inside a Trojan horse and
not giggle?

Still, September's scandals in Forex aren't over. According to Financial
Times, Philip Lane, the ECB's key economist, revealed in a private talk
with German businessmen that the eurozone's inflation was expected to
reach 2% by 2025. If so, the rate might be raised as early as 2023 and
not 2024, as expected. The European Central bank has already said in a
statement that Lane didn't say anything officially. Politicians make so
many mistakes. I wish they were sappers.

If you do good for money, they thank you. If you do good for free, you
owe them.  Whether or not China bribed Kristalina Georgieva no longer
matters. What matters is that Beijing strives to boost its authority in
the financial world by all means. The Fed's members just wanted to make
money while the ECB might not want to mention inflation's reaching the
target. Is it afraid of the euro's consolidation?
