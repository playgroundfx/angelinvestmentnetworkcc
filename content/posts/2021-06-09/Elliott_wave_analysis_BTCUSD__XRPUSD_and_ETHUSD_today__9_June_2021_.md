Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 09.06.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

Most likely, all three cryptocurrencies will rise within bullish
impulses in the near future.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

The upward corrective wave [2] is still unfolding. Most likely, it will
take the form of a simple zigzag (A) - (B) - (C), where (A) and (C) are
impulses, and (B) is a horizontal corrective wave in the shape of a
contracting triangle A-B-C-D-E. It seems that the market has completed
the formation of the last wave E of this triangle as a zigzag [A] - [B]
- [C]. It is assumed that shortly the price may start moving upward
within wave (C), which may unfold as a simple zigzag. The target, at
which the wave (C) is expected to end, is located at the level of
44500.00. At this level, wave [2] will be 50% of wave [1].

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 32938.50, TP 44500.00

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

The XRPUSD market is developing an upward linking wave (X) as a simple
A-B-C zigzag. It seems that the corrective wave B has been completed.
This correction took the form of a double zigzag [W] - [X] - [Y]. Sub-
waves [W] and [Y] are double zigzags, while linking wave [X] is a simple
zigzag. Thus, shortly the price may move upward within an impulse wave C
to the level of 1.153. At this level, wave (X) will reach the Fibonacci
level of 38.2% of the current bear wave (W).

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] today:

Buy 0.844, TP 1.153

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

The ETHUSD market continues to form an upward corrective wave 2 as a
simple zigzag [A] - [B] - [C]. The impulse wave [A] has been completed
as well as a bear correction [B], which is a double zigzag. Impulse wave
[C] is still unfolding, more precisely, its last part is sub-wave (5),
as corrective wave (4) looks completed with sub-waves W-X-Y-XX-Z. Most
likely, prices will rise to the level of 3340.00. At this level, wave 2
will reach the Fibonacci level of 61.8% of wave 1.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Buy 2450.61, TP 3340.00
