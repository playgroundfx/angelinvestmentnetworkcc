Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 09.06.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

The euro is trading within a short-term downtrend, the target of which
is the Target Zone 1.2090 - 1.2072.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

After the test of the Additional Zone 68.51 - 68.38, a new upward
impulse was formed, which was used by the traders to break out the Gold
Zone 69.73 - 69.46 and consolidate the price above. The next growth
target is the Target Zone 2 72.64 - 72.11.

It is profitable to consider new oil purchases on correction according
to the pattern in:

  1. Micro-zone 69.81 - 69.74

  2. Additional Zone 69.14 - 69.01

The technical border of the uptrend is at level 68.43. The target for
purchases will be today's high.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

  1. Buy according to the pattern in Micro-zone 69.81 - 69.74. TakeProfit: 70.45. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. Buy according to the pattern in Additional Zone 69.14 - 69.01. TakeProfit: 70.45. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

After the test of the Target Zone 1905 - 1901, the gold price went into
correction. Yesterday, XAU price tested the Additional Zone 1892 - 1890,
in which I recommended buying the precious metal with a target at level
1903. The trading idea to buy yielded profits. Immediately after the
update of the high, a new correction was formed, within which a new
Additional Zone 1892.4 - 1891.3 had already been broken out.

At the moment, the correction continues to develop. The target of the
price fall is the Intermediary Zone 1881 - 1878. It would be reasonable
to sell the precious metal in the zone of 1896 - 1891.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

Sell from the zone of 1896 - 1891. TakeProfit: Intermediary Zone 1881 -
1878. StopLoss: 1898.8.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

The euro is trading within a short-term downtrend, the target of which
is the Target Zone 1.2090 - 1.2072. Yesterday, the traders again tried
to break out the Intermediary Zone 1.2200 - 1.2192, but unsuccessful.
Therefore, today, keep looking for a sell pattern.

One of the possible variants of the pattern could be a “double top”. So,
the traders need to repeat the June 7 high and then break out the
support 1.2171. However, any model of technical analysis for selling is
suitable for entering a trade.

It will be possible to buy the euro after the trend reversal up. This
requires the Intermediary Zone breakout and price consolidation at the
US session higher.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

Sell according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 1.2200 - 1.2192.
TakeProfit: Target Zone 1.2090 - 1.2072. StopLoss: according to the
pattern.
