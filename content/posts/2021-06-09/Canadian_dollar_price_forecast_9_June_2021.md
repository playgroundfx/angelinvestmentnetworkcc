Loonie leads, but not without problems. Forecast as of 09.06.2021Dmitri
Demidenko

The Canadian dollar continues to lead the race for the best G10
performer of the year. However, in May-June, [USDCAD][1] bears' business
deteriorated. What discourages them from going ahead? Let us discuss the
Forex outlook and make up a trading plan

## Weekly Canadian dollar fundamental forecast

Modern aircraft are capable of using only one engine if something
happens to the second, but their maneuverability lowers. The main
drivers of the CAD strengthening in 2021 were the oil price rally and
the BoC's intention to normalize monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) before the Fed. So far,
the situation with oil is normal, but a slower recovery of the Canadian
economy than the central bank expected deprives the loonie of its
maneuverability. [USDCAD][1] has been in a trading range of 1.2-1.215
since the beginning of May, and it is difficult to predict when the pair
will leave it.

In the first quarter, Canada's GDP grew by 5.6% YoY, which is not in
line with the regulator's forecasts. In the second quarter, the economy
is not developing as fast as the Bank of Canada expected as well. For
example, the drop in employment in April-May by 275 thousand people did
not let the labor market recover to pre-pandemic levels.

It is unlikely that this negative [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) will force the BoC to abandon the
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) normalization. In April, the Bank of England reduced the
scale of the QE program from CA$4 billion to CA$3 billion a week and is
likely to reduce it to CA$2 billion in July and to CA$1 billion by the
end of the year. The acceleration of inflation to its highest levels
since the mid-1990s, overheating of the real estate market, rapid
vaccinations (almost 71% of Canadians received at least one dose) and
the associated expectations of an economic boom are forcing the central
bank to adhere to monetary restriction.

### Dynamics of asset purchases by the Bank of Canada

The derivatives market expects with a 60% probability one overnight rate
hike of 25 bps over the next 12 months. The three hikes are fully
accounted for during 2022-2023, making Canada one of the countries with
the highest borrowing costs among advanced economies. By comparison,
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s do not expect the Fed to raise the federal funds rate in 2022
and expect the rate to rise by only 25 bps in 2023.

No major developments are expected at the June BoC meeting. However, due
to weaker data than expected, there is a possibility of a change of the
BoC's stance regarding the exchange rate. Earlier, Tiff Macklem stated
that he does not see any particular obstacles for the economy to
contribute to the loonie strengthening. Indeed, do exporters need to
panic if oil in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of the national currency of Canada has grown by
40% since the beginning of the year, and the number of people willing to
buy call [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) on [WTI][2] with a strike price of $100 per barrel in
December 2022 is growing in the derivatives market?

### Weekly [USDCAD][1] trading plan

In my opinion, it is extremely doubtful that the statements of the BoC
head can seriously affect the Canadian dollar. Its medium and long-term
prospects look optimistic against the backdrop of a bullish oil trend, a
robust economy, and outstripping action by the BoC compared to the Fed.
Moving of [USDCAD][1] price beyond the upper border of the trading range
1.2-1.215 with a subsequent return to its middle, or a confident
breakout of support at 1.2 should be used to enter long trades.
