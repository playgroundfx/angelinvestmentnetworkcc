Dollar growing impatient. Forecast as of 09.06.2021Dmitri Demidenko

As long as the global economy's recovery remains uneven, the only
important factor in the USD index's fall is the Fed's inaction. However,
everything may change if the US inflation continues growing. Let’s
discuss it and make a trading plan for the [EURUSD][1].

## Weekly fundamental forecast for dollar

The more you get, the more you want. Dollar-the-King has shared its
power politely with other currencies, and [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are now wondering
how long it will look through its fingers at their growing appetites.
Rumor has it that the USD index'15-month downward trend may end if the
Fed normalizes monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) faster than expected. Investors are
looking for hints, and the US inflation figures may become one in May.

The same scheme is usually applied for an economy to recover after a
recession: governments prescribe a medicine in the form of fiscal and
monetary stimuli for weak economies, and they gradually recover. The US
usually does more than other countries, thus helping its GDP to grow
faster. Still, the dollar can't take advantage of the economic growth
divergence as all the other countries reap the benefits of the US
economic expansion. What's more, the global GDP's synchronous recovery
worsens the greenback's fall, and only the normalization of monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) can save the dollar. Thus, some changes were brought to the usual
scheme in 2021.

First, the Fed changed its position. Second, there isn't any synchronous
global economic recovery. According to Global Economic Prospects, 94% of
high-income countries will return to their pre-recession GDP levels
within two years, whereas that result is expected to be 40% in low-
income countries. These would be the highest and the lowest ratios in
such a short period after any recession since World War II.

The reasons are different scales of vaccination and monetary support. In
high-income countries, fiscal support averaged 17%. Monetary support was
15 % of GDP. In developing countries, fiscal and monetary support
amounted to 5% and 3%, respectively. So, the global economy can't
compete with the US one for now, and the Fed's inaction is the only
significant factor in the USD's weakening. If inflation grows too fast,
the central bank may step in unexpectedly.

A new trading war might hit [EURUSD][1] bulls like a bucket of cold
water. The White House is considering new tariffs on Chinese imports of
rare earth magnets that may threaten US national security. Many
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s expected that Joe Biden would take a more conciliatory
approach to China, but he didn't. Biden’s ban on American investment in
Chinese firms is even larger than Trump's.

 **Weekly trading plan for**[ **EURUSD**][1] ****

The market is now waiting for US inflation data and the ECB's meeting
results. If the last day ahead of those important events is as dull as
the two previous ones, we might see an explosion on 10 June. On the
contrary, the[ EURUSD][1]'s rumor-based fall below 1.216 will let us buy
the pair on facts.
