Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

After reaching the Target Zone 3 1768 - 1763 and updating the June 17
low, the gold price correction began.

The article covers the following subjects:

trend remains up. The key support is located at the level 70.08 - 69.82.
