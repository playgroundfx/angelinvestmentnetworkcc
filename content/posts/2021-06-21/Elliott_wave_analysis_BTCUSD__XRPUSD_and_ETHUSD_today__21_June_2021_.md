Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 21.06.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

All three cryptocurrency pairs covered in the article should be forming
final sections of large impulse sub-waves. Let us study each pair in
detail.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

The hourly timeframe of the BTCUSD price chart displays the descending
wave (A) unfolding as a five-wave impulse. Wave (A) is an element of the
zigzag of a larger degree. The corrective wave 4 must have completed
recently as a double zigzag composed of the sub-waves [W]-[X]-[Y]. The
market is going down in the final wave 5. There should be developing
sub-waves [3]-[4]-[5], driving the price to a level of 26060.00, as it
is outlined in the chart. At level 26060.00, wave 5 will be 50% of wave
3, which is not visible in the chart. One could enter sell trades in the
current situation.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Sell 34144.50, TP 26060.00

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

The XRPUSD market is moving down in the impulse wave C composed of five
sub-waves marked with green numbers [1]-[2]-[3]-[4]-[5]. Since early
June, the market has been developing the fifth sub-waves of this
pattern. So far, there have completed sub-waves (1)-(2)-(3)-(4), and the
final sub-wave (5) is still unfolding. The Ripple price should continue
falling to a level of 0.560, as it is outlined in the chart. Once wave
(5) completes, the market should start developing a new bullish trend.
One could enter sell trades in the current situation.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] today:

Sell 0.712, TP 0.560

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

The ETHUSD market is forming the descending wave A as a five-wave
impulse. The chart displays the second half of this wave. The first four
sub-waves must have completed, and there is developing the descending
sub-wave [5], namely its third impulse wave (3). Next, there will start
the corrective wave (4). The entire impulse wave A should finish at
level 1700.00. It is the previous low made by wave [3]. One could enter
sell trades in the current situation.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Sell 2109.28, TP 1700.00
