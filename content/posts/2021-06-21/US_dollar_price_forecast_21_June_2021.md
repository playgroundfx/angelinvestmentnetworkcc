Dollar made a fuss. Forecast as of 21.06.21Dmitri Demidenko

The EURUSD crashed dramatically. The euro was falling faster only during
the shock due to the pandemic and after Donald Trump's victory in the
presidential election. What's next? Let us discuss the Forex outlook and
make up a [EURUSD][1] trading plan.

## Weekly US dollar fundamental forecast

The Fed has started talking about normalizing its ultra-easy monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), which resulted in turmoil in financial markets. The US dollar
performed the best weekly rise against a basket of major currencies
since April 2020. Over the past five years, the USD achieved the best
results only twice: during the shock amid COVID-19 in 2020 and after the
election of Donald Trump as the US President in 2016. The rise of the
greenback in the week ending June 18 was as strong as its strengthening
amid the Brexit referendum in 2016. And it happened only amid the change
in the FOMC rate forecast. How amazing the market can be: on one side of
the scales, there are events that shook the whole world, on the other
one - moving dots.

The market turmoil resulted from the pummelling of the reflation trade.
Investors were betting on the continuation of the stimulating measures.
Markets were not concerned about rising inflation, as the Fed was not
concerned. Because of the Fed’s passive approach, the yield on two-year
Treasuries, responsive to the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), has been in a narrow
trading range of 0.1%-0.18% since June 2020. And now, a year later, the
two-year yield is up to 0.27%, following the talks of an earlier
monetary restriction by the Federal Reserve than expected. Moreover, St.
Louis Fed President James Bullard added fuel to the fire by announcing
that federal funds rates could be raised at the end of 2022.

US stock markets featured the worst drop over the past four months. Raw
materials, seen by many [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s as a hedge against inflation, had the
worst drop since the start of the pandemic. Tech stocks are rising,
10-year Treasury yield is declining. It looks as if the economy is back
into the recession. Investors doubt the US economic recovery and buy the
assets that benefited from the downturn last year. Is the reflation
trade dead? Investors again come back to the idea that if any time the
Fed gets a whiff of inflation, the central bank will come in and slap it
back down. Of course, a change in the Fed’s stance could serve as an
example to follow for other central banks, encouraging them to raise
interest rates too. But that is not about Europe.

According to an ECB survey, major banks in its market [contact](https://www.playgroundfx.com/contact/) groups,
including Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank, Societe
Generale, and others, predict that the Pandemic Emergency Asset Purchase
Program (PEPP) will be extended until the end of 2023, and The European
regulator will raise rates only in 2024. The Fed clearly intends to act
faster, which suggests a reason to sell the [EURUSD][2].

### Weekly [EURUSD][2] trading plan

How deep could the euro fall? Goldman Sachs believes that the euro-
dollar might drop by another 2% before it starts rising. This scenario
looks quite likely. The [EURUSD][2] could drop to 1.175. However, if the
euro consolidates above $1.188, it could start consolidation.
