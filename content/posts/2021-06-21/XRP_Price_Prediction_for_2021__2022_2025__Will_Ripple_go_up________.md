XRP Price Predictions & Ripple forecast: 2021 and BeyondJana Kane

Ripple XRP is one of the world's foremost cryptos - and one of the most
intriguing. Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other big names, it does not
market itself with its decentralization. Instead, the crypto is closely
associated with several banks, investment companies, and organizations
worldwide.

This may seem counterproductive when many traders believe that the
biggest selling point of cryptocurrencies is their freedom of influence
from outside companies. However, crypto experts are increasingly arguing
that it could be the key to Ripple's success.

At the end of 2020, the company faced an SEC lawsuit that put the Ripple
future under threat. Making a Ripple price prediction has become
challenging for experts and common [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s. Why is Ripple going up and
down? How high will Ripple go? Let's find out!

The article covers the following subjects:

## What Is Ripple Crypto and the History of XRP?

Ripple or XRP: are they synonyms or different [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)? If you are new to
the crypto market, you may have such questions in your mind. Thus, we
will start our price guide with basic [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/). It will allow you to
differentiate Ripple's products.

In order for traders to understand Ripple price predictions, it is
important to know what Ripple XRP is and why it differs from most other
cryptos on the market.

Put simply, Ripple is a company that provides a payment protocol that
can be compared to a payment system, money transfer network, and
currency exchange. The protocol works with digital currencies, fiat
money, and commodities. XRP is the protocol's internal coin.

If you want to have a deeper understanding of the Ripple topic, check
the following [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/).

  * XRP or Ripple is a cryptocurrency that’s powered by RippleNet. Financial institutions use the coin to provide fast transactions with low fees. 

  * RippleNet represents a payment platform. It's based on the distributed ledger database of XRP Ledger. Ripple operates the digital platform. RippleNet Cloud is used to deal with payments with one integration and a common Ripple Payment Object among RippleNet’s customers. It allows for “less friction and more standardization when customers are ready to scale.” 

  * As for the XRP Ledger, it's open-source and is based on the ledger database, not [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/).

### About Ripple - A Crash Course on XRP

Ryan Fugger was the first person who announced the idea of Ripple. It
was in 2004. However, the protocol's real [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) started only in 2012
when Jed McCaleb and Chris Larson took over the project. That time it
was not even Ripple but OpenCoin. The platform is actually called
RippleNet, while the crypto token is Ripple XRP. (It is usually listed
as XRP on exchanges).

First, it was a startup project from San Francisco; the [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/)-like
payment system was developed. It was created as an alternative to money
transfers for the banking system, not as an opposition. Its popularity
among financial institutions grew fast, and soon the company announced
interest from leading banks. It was expected as the system enforced low-
fee fast transfers all around the world.

Most altcoins that have entered the market are designed to solve some
problems that the founders believed could ultimately limit the success
of Bitcoin, the so-called king of cryptocurrency. Many, like Bitcoin
Cash, have focused on Bitcoin's lack of scalability. However, Ripple
focused on another feature of crypto: its decentralization.

Rather than providing a way for merchants and [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s to make
transactions online without going through a centralized financial
institution (which can be slow, potentially unsafe, and expensive),
Ripple was designed to make it easier for centralized financial
institutions to make payments. Cross-border payments can be even slower
than domestic payments, and they come with much higher transaction costs
- and companies worldwide can make hundreds of these transactions every
day.

To avoid skyrocketing transaction fees and unfavorable exchange rates,
Ripple allows companies to send and receive payments in Ripple XRP. It
offers a globalized currency that bypasses some of the problems that can
plague fiat currency and fully decentralized cryptos.

Banks apply the protocol to make cross-border transfers in real-time
using the xCurrent software solution. At the same time, Ripple (XRP) is
also available for [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s and traders. Traders can do operations with
the cryptocurrency via trading on crypto exchanges or with the help of
brokers. The company has had [contact](https://www.playgroundfx.com/contact/)s at the [highest political and
financial levels][1] for many years. Think of the World Bank, the ECB,
the IMF, and the World Economic Forum. With rave recommendations and
being priced from all sides – what could go wrong?

## What Happened to XRP in 2020?

Before we list experts' opinions regarding XRP price forecasts and
Ripple's future, let's look at the price [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) that will uncover
plenty of vital things for any [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/). First, you will see what
affects the current price of XRP and in what way. And, you will catch
the current market conditions to be in the market.

During 2020, the [XRP market price][2] was relatively stable with
several medium-term bullish and bearish trends. After the upward
movement at the beginning of the year, the price was declining for a
month, from February to March. The next bullish trend occurred in July
but finished in less than a month. The main rise happened in November
when the price hit a maximum of $0.79.

Why is Ripple going up or down? If you think that something specific is
hidden behind these price movements, it's a mistake. The major Ripple
trends are positively correlated with BTC movements, so even Bitcoin
halving can affect the XRP price. The cryptocurrency repeats the trend
of the primary market.

Still, there were some certain events we should mention. Investors'
sentiments determine the price direction of any asset. Ripple
supply/demand factor plays a huge role. In April 2020, the co-founder of
Ripple Jed McCaleb sold 54 million Ripples. It's not a surprise that the
price moved down after the event became public.

New agreements with leading banks are one of the main drivers of XRP's
price. For example, in August, India's largest bank HDFC Bank Limited
joined RippleNet, in November, the second American largest bank, the
Bank of America, signed an agreement with Ripple.

In December, such leading US exchanges as Coinbase and Binance claimed
support for the upcoming airdrop of Spark tokens by Flare Networks. The
Flare airdrop took place, and 45 billion Spark tokens were distributed
among the XRP holders. The XRP price increased on the [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/); however, it
was corrected shortly.

Such events have short-term market effects that aren’t visible on high
timeframes.

Well, we have come to the most significant event that is still affecting
Ripple. The SEC, the US stock market watchdog, is challenging [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/)
company Ripple Inc. in court, along with its two top figures, CEO Brad
Garlinghouse and founder Christian Larsen. The [regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/)s in the US are
tough. The Securities and Exchange Commission's accusation is that
unregistered securities worth [$1.3 billion were sold in 2013][3]. It is
an old case hanging over Ripple for as long as we can remember. Ripple
has always maintained that the digital currency is a currency instead of
a security. Because otherwise, they'd have to comply with a lot of
different rules according to American law. Many are amazed that the US
apparently wants to slaughter the goose that lays the golden eggs.

In two days, from December 22 to 23, 2020, the XRP rate dropped from
approximately $0.50 to just under $0.30. From third place as the most
important cryptocurrency, the coin moved to fourth place, behind
stablecoin Tether.

## XRP Price Prediction for 2021 by Crypto Experts

The SEC case hasn't been solved yet. And if, before, it had a dramatic
effect on the XRP price, now, the situation is not so obvious. At the
end of 2020, the XRP price fell to a local minimum of $0.17 while the
SEC case was gaining momentum. At the beginning of April 2021, the XRP
value renewed its three-year high at $1.11 while the court allowed the
company to review the internal documents of the SEC.

On May 4, Ripple plunged as the SEC threatened XRP holders with legal
action. The Commission opposes [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s to join the XRP securities
recognition case. Nevertheless, the fall didn't continue for long, as
the company appointed a former US treasurer to its board.

How should [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s behave in such uncertain circumstances? Is Ripple
expected to rise or fall? Look at experts' predictions.

TradingBeasts expects the average [XRP][2] price to stay within a
$1.73-1.79 range. The [website](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/website-for-forex-trading/) sees an uptrend, which is a good sign for
traders. The maximum price will reach $2.24 in December 2021. The
minimum price won't fall below $1.47 (June 2021).

The average price of the XRP will fluctuate near $1.5 until December,
when the rate will touch $1.84. Although the [website](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/website-for-forex-trading/) doesn't predict a
strong uptrend, the average price stays at good levels. The highest
price will always be near $1.8, surging above $2 in December. The
minimum rate won't fall below $1.1.

The Ripple forecast of Crypto Ground can't be called promising. Still,
the upward movement will prevail. By 2022, the price will reach $1.92.

This [website](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/website-for-forex-trading/) can shock traders with an over-optimistic projection.
According to Coin Price Forecast, the price may reach $4.77 by the
middle of the year, while at the end of 2021, it will be $5.

Below, you can check the Ripple coin price prediction by the Economy
Forecast Agency. The source doesn't see a sharp uptrend. The price of
the XRP/USD pair will suffer high volatility during the year. Although
the pair will end 2021 above $2, the way to this threshold will be
highlighted by ups and downs.

## Ripple Technical Analysis

Will Ripple Go Up? How High Can Ripple Go? Look at  XRP Technical
Analysis.

We shall start the [XRPUSD][2] technical analysis by exploring the
monthly Ripple price chart outlook. First, we will identify the global
trend and the key levels.

 ****

As you see from the [XRP/USD][4] [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) chart, the price has been
regularly updating local highs and lows since March 2020 (see the
candlesticks above the blue trendline). Despite the powerful impulses
and sell-offs, there is a general global bullish trend.

 ****

Another important marker is surges of trade volumes marked with blue
dots in the prediction chart.

An increase in trader activity in December 2021 resulted in a failed try
to break out at level $0.17. The red candlestick’s low determinesthe
strong support level at 0.17, marked with the red line in the chart.
Note that, starting from the second half of 2019, the XRP/USD quotes
have often approached this line, but it has never consolidated below.
This fact suggests the presence of a powerful buyer in the market,
actively buying out all the orders at this level to push the price up to
the Ripple price target above.

The next, even more significant, trade volume peak points out a powerful
resistance level reached by the January candlestick high (green line).
In September 2018, the price movement already stopped at level 0.75 USD.
This level should attract large sellers, creating selling pressure.

### XRP Price Prediction for the Next Three Months

Let’s go to the technical analysis in the weekly [Ripple chart][2].

 ****

Note that most of the time, the XRP quotes have been moving within a
narrow Bollinger band. So, the price should be swinging in the range of
0.18 USD – 0.50 USD.

 ****

Having explored the[ XRPUSD][2] exchange rate [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) data, I noticed
similar fractals, which could be conventionally divided into three
phases.

  * Red circle – consolidation with strong upward momentum.

  * Blue circle – a sharp correction, following the impulse, going down to the level where the Ripple growth started or lower.

  * Green circle – widening consolidation range with false breakouts of local highs and lows.

As you see from the chart above, this fractal in the bullish trend
features the upward price movement in a broad trading channel. However,
I can state for sure that the[][2]price finished the stage of the blue
circle. Therefore, the market should be trading sideways in the range of
0.23 USD and 0.70 USD over the next three months.

### XRP Forecast for 2021

Having carried out the fractals’ technical analysis in the Ripple
market, I offer the XRP/USD price projection for 2021.

 ****

Taking into account the width of the trading channel and the range of
Bollinger bands, I suggest the[XRPUSD][2] future price movement for
2021. I determined the range of the likely market movement by projecting
the monthly candlestick, highlighted with an orange box in the chart.

In the main, the trading scenario suggests a consolidation in the broad
range between levels 0.29 USD and 0.74 USD until late spring. The rate
is likely to retest the upper and the lower channel borders this year.
When you consider the wave sequence, there should be, first, a peak in
the zone of 0.75 USD – 0.85 USD. Next, the [XRPUSD][2] traders should
try to test the support level in the price range of 0.17 USD – 0.18 USD.

The detailed XRP price forecast for each month is in the table below:

 _The[XRPUSD][2] price technical analysis is presented by [Mikhail
Hypov][5]. _

## Weekly Elliott wave Ripple analysis as of 21.06.2021

The XRPUSD market is forming a simple global zigzag A-B-C in the long
term. In late 2017, the price growth in impulse wave A stopped, and
there started unfolding a corrective wave. The B correction must be
developing as a double zigzag [W]-[X]-[Y]. The first motive wave [W] is
a triple zigzag. The linking wave [X] has completed as a double zigzag
(W)-(X)-(Y). There could be forming the inceptive part of the final
motive wave. Let us study the most recent chart section in the H8 hour
timeframe.

After the linking wave [X] completed, the market has turned down and
started declining. There could be forming the initial part of the new
bearish double zigzag (W)-(X)-(Y), wave (W). The (W) is composed of
three sub-waves A-B-C. The first two legs have completed, and the final
impulse wave C is still developing. The C wave is composed of five sub-
waves [1]-[2]-[3]-[4]-[5]. There should soon end the final impulse wave
[5]. The price should go down to a level of 0.560 in wave (5) of [5], as
outlined in the chart. Next, the price should start rising in wave (X).
One could enter sell trades in the current situation.

### Weekly [XRPUSD][2] trading plan:

Sell 0.704, TP 0.560

## Ripple Price Prediction for 2022 by Crypto Experts

2021 isn't less challenging for Ripple than 2020. The price will keep
jumping until the SEC case is solved. Let's see what leading crypto
sources say about the Ripple future value.

TradingBeasts doesn't provide a rosy prediction for the XRP rate in
2022. Although the price will hold above $1.8 at the beginning of the
year, the downtrend will prevail from June onwards. By December 2022,
the average projected value will move to $1.48.

As for Wallet Investor, the Ripple price forecast is also pessimistic.
The platform predicts a downward trend. The rate will fluctuate near
$1.66-1.73 until December, when it's expected to cross $2 again.

Crypto Ground disagrees with such pessimistic forecasts. Although there
will be a short downward movement at the beginning of the year, the
source sees a bullish trend in 2022. The price will be able to hit $2
and come to 2023 at $2.42.

Changelly platform: "As soon as XRP reaches $1, the correction phase may
enter. The most likely zone for XRP price in 2022 is from $0.5 to $1.
However, if the company gains support from the investment giants, the
XRP rate can change its direction to a new bull run."

The Economy Forecast Agency has a bearish forecast for Ripple in 2022.
The price will decline from $2.17 to $1.53 during the year. Moreover,
the table below signals high price volatility.

## Ripple Price Prediction for 2023 by Crypto Experts

Moving further, we see that although the price of XRP won’t hit
exclusive highs, the cryptocurrency won’t disappear. What awaits the XRP
coin price in 2023? How much will it cost?

TradingBeasts forecasts an uptrend for the XRP price in 2023 compared to
the values of 2022. Still, the average price will be much lower than in
2021. During the year, the exchange rate of the XRP/USD pair will rise
from $1.50 to $1.78.

The Wallet Investor [website](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/website-for-forex-trading/) isn't so negative about the XRP future. The
price won't show a strong up- or downtrend, moving near $1.9. A sharp
rise will be noticed at the end of the year, when we will see the XRP at
$2.22.

Crypto Ground is still the most optimistic about the XRP price. Despite
a slight correction down at the beginning of the year, the
cryptocurrency is anticipated to stay above $2, reaching $2.77 by 2024.

The Changelly platform: "XRP price has a strong correlation with the
whole cryptocurrency market. It means that if Bitcoin or altcoins will
grow, then Ripple is likely to reach the previous all-time high point of
$3.84. This is a very optimistic scenario. If the SEC wins the lawsuit,
the XRP price can fall down to a couple of cents."

The Economy Forecast Agency is bearish about Ripple in 2023. The price
will be set at $1.53 in January. Nevertheless, the overall downward
trend will lead the coin to 87 cents at the end of the year.

##  Long Term Ripple Prediction: 2025-2030

How much will Ripple be worth in 5-10 years? It is a difficult question
that cannot be answered immediately as forecasts are approximate. You
never know what will happen to the price tomorrow. Is it possible to
predict what will be in 5-10 years? It is, therefore, best to be aware
of the latest Ripple [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/). Then you know what the project and the
community are doing. To have a good understanding of the [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/)
projects, check which developments are planned, which collaborations
they are working on or already exist, how they are working with the
community, and other factors.

Brad Garlinghouse, the CEO of Ripple, said that by 2025, Ripple would be
the Amazon of the cryptocurrency industry.

### #1 Crypto Ground

Crypto Ground believes the cryptocurrency will climb above $3 in 2025
and 2026. The primary trend is bullish. In 2026, the price of XRP may
stay at $3.42.

### #2 Wallet Investor

The Wallet Investor [website](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/website-for-forex-trading/) is positive about XRP in 2025. The average

## How Has The Price Of Ripple Changed Over Time?

It’s wrong to check XRP price predictions without looking back at recent
and not-so-recent events. The SEC situation made that even more precise.
The Ripple price today is $0.66506. Looking at the full price chart
below, you can see how the price of XRP changed over the years and where
it stood on the day of writing, February 16, 2021, after the turbulence
it went through with the SEC.

XRP was stable from its launch in 2013 until early 2017, when the
sideway movement ended. By the end of 2017, its price skyrocketed by
35,000%. This success occurred as Ripple managed to achieve a threshold
of 100 banks worldwide that signed on to RippleNet.

On January 4th, 2018, the XRP/USD rate reached an all-time high.
However, it couldn’t sustain those levels, and it subsequently dropped
by 76% within one month. The plummet was caused by fears of new
[regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/)s on the Asian markets. This factor affected not only XRP but
also other cryptos. In 2018, the total market cap for cryptocurrencies
declined by around 43%.

The sharp downtrend that continued until February was also boosted by
other factors. Facebook declared it would ban advertisements for
cryptocurrencies and ICOs. US regulators summoned Bitfinex and Tether to
a court. The further decline was spurred by the finance minister of
India, who said the country would do everything it could to discontinue
the use of virtual currencies.

However, the year did not only bring bad [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) for XRP. A significant
surge took place in September 2018. Within several days at the end of
September, Ripple grew by over 140%. The XRP/USD rate was pushed up
after Ripple’s Head of Regulatory Relations for Asia-Pacific and the
Middle East, Sagar Sarbhai, said the company would release a product to
expedite bank transactions with the use of XRP.

2019 was quite stable for Ripple, with no dramatic ups and downs. As the
Ripple network is very active in Southeast Asia, [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) on cross-border
payments and state cryptocurrencies in this region significantly impacts
its price. For instance, the XRP’s rate moved up after Japan and South
Korea started working on time and cost reduction for transferring
international funds between the two countries. By the end of 2019, the
downtrend strengthened. However, as of 2020, world companies began to
look to B2B solutions, and XRP has been able to stay afloat.

The year 2020 wasn’t marked by significant price movements. High
volatility occurred due to the SEC case. This legal action led to XRP’s
decline from around 70 cents to 20 cents.

At the beginning of 2021, XRP was gaining momentum. However, it hasn’t
reached the highs of the beginning of 2018. Unlike other crypto assets,
which started an upward movement in late 2020, XRP’s price spiked only
at the beginning of 2021. Yet, it still has a chance to appreciate
further.

## Is Ripple a Good Investment?

Should I invest in Ripple? Ripple: buy or sell? Maybe these questions
are still in your head. Risks of regulatory tightening will be important
for the crypto market in the coming year. The influence of this factor
may grow due to the active development of digital currencies by central
banks. Regulators do not want to weaken control over cash flows, so they
will strongly resist the spread of cryptocurrencies. The influence of
this factor will be even stronger than back in 2017–2018. The expected
development of DeFi is another risk for Ripple.

Oddly enough, the coronavirus pandemic can support the virtual market.
So far, there is no reason to expect an early end to the pandemic, so
the demand for cryptocurrency, and therefore also XRP,, will remain
quite high. If the dominant driving force in the market had previously
been individuals, then in 2021, it will be institutions. Therefore, next
year we will most likely see a smooth rise in the XRP coin. Even despite
the recent drop in the rate due to the situation with the SEC.
