Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 11.05.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

Yesterday, oil traders were unable to break out the Target Zone 66.20 -
65.69.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

Yesterday, oil traders were unable to break out the Target Zone 66.20 -
65.69. As a result, a retest of the Intermediary Zone 64.14 - 63.88
occurred.

Today, it is reasonable to wait for the formation of a pattern to buy
oil in the zone of 64.14 - 63.13 with a target at Monday's high 65.57.
The second target will be level 66.54.

A breakout of the trend border 63.13 is required to reverse the trend
and enter sales. If the price closes below this level at the US session,
sell WTI oil with the target at the lower Target Zone 61.59 - 61.08.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

Open buy positions according to the pattern in 64.14 - 63.13.
TakeProfit: 65.57, 66.54. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

Yesterday, gold trades entered in the Additional Zone 1830 - 1829
yielded profit. The local high was updated. Also yesterday, the Gold
Zone 1833 - 1831 was broken out. This event will allow gold prices to
grow to the area of Target Zone 2 1861 - 1856.

At the moment, traders are testing the local support 1834 - 1830. If the
price didn't break out the zone, then open long trades with the target
at level 1842. If the zone is broken out, open short trades with the
target in the Intermediary Zone 1823 - 1820.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

  1. Open buy positions according to the pattern in 1834 - 1830. TakeProfit: 1842. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. Aggressive: sell when level 1830 is broken out. TakeProfit: Intermediary Zone 1823 - 1820. StopLoss: above the local high.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

The euro price is correcting to a short-term uptrend and is currently
testing the local support 1.2134 - 1.2129. Holding the zone and forming
a buy pattern will allow considering a long trade with the target at
level 1.2170.

The breakout of the Additional Zone will make it possible to correct the
euro price down to the Intermediary Zone 1.2090 - 1.2081. The
Intermediary Zone is the trend border. It is profitable to enter
purchases in the beforementioned IZ according to the pattern.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

  1. Buy according to the pattern in Additional Zone 1.2134 - 1.2129. TakeProfit: 1.2170. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. Aggressive: sell when the Additional Zone 1.2134 - 1.2129 is broken out. TakeProfit: Intermediary Zone 1.2090 - 1.2081. StopLoss: above the next high.
