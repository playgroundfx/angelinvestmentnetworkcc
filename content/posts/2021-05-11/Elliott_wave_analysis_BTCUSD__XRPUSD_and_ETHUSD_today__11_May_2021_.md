Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 11.05.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

All three cryptocurrency pairs covered in the article are moving
according to the suggested scenarios. Continue monitoring the
cryptocurrency market.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

The BTCUSD market must have completed forming the corrective upwave 2.
As I suggested, there is developing the beginning of the bearish
impulse, composed of sub-waves (1)-(2)-(3)-(4)-(5). The Bitcoin price
should go down to a low of 4200.00, and next, even lower. One could
enter sell trades in the current situation.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Sell 55290.00, TP 47000.00

* * *

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

The XRPUSD market continues forming the upward impulse wave (1), which
begins a large impulse wave [3]. The bearish correction 4 may not be a
double zigzag; it could be a triple zigzag composed of the sub-waves
[W]-[X]-[Y]-[X]-[Z]. This correction looks complete, so the market
should be rising in wave 5 towards the previous high of 1.961.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] today:

Buy 1.401, TP 1.961

* * *

## Elliott wave Ethereum analysis

The previously suggested scenario must have worked out, and the ETHUSD
has completed the large impulse wave C. The market has turned down
started declining. There could be unfolding the inceptive part of the
bearish impulse [1]-[2]-[3]-[4]-[5]. The price should be declining
towards the low of 3352.00, and lower. One could enter short trades in
the current situation.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Sell 3892.87, TP 3352.00
