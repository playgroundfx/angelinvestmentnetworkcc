Pound continues strengthening. Forecast as of 11.05.2021Dmitri Demidenko

It is not for nothing that sterling claims to be the best G10 performer
of the year. Despite often unfavorable conditions, the GBP manages to
strengthen. Will the [GBPUSD][1] price continue to grow? Let us discuss
the Forex outlook and make up a trading plan

## Fundamental pound forecast for six months

The pound's ability to catch a fish in muddy waters has become a byword.
For most of 2020, the pound had been strengthening as the UK was at the
epicenter of a raging pandemic and a successful Brexit seemed like a
pipe dream. In May 2021, [GBPUSD][1] price soared to its highest level
since the end of February, despite rumors about a referendum on Scottish
independence, a likely 1.7% decline in UK GDP in the first quarter, and
an expansion of the current account to its highest level since World War
II. The waters are really muddy, but the sterling is not confused as
always.

While Rabobank and Credit Suisse describe the Scottish independence
referendum as a headwind for the pound, and the [GBPUSD][1] bears
sincerely hope that the deteriorating state of UK foreign trade will
create obstacles to their opponents, the pair has grown steadily and
managed to consolidate above the bottom of the figure 41. Yes, the first
quarter was difficult. Yes, exports suffer because of Brexit, and strong
domestic demand contributes to the expansion of imports. Yes, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s
can demand a risk premium before pouring money into the country and
financing the colossal current account deficit, but [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s prefer
buying the [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) rather than looking back!

### Dynamics of the UK current account

The fact that the Bank of England has reduced the volume of weekly asset
purchases within the QE from £4.4 billion to £3.4 billion and predicts
7.25% GDP growth in 2021, the best in the last 70 years, means more for
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s than negative [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) from foreign trade. Moreover, the political
risks are not as dire as the GBPUSD bears are trying to present them.
The Scottish Nationalist Party failed to win an absolute majority in the
local parliament, while the Conservatives in power widened their lead
over Labor in the midterm elections due to a successful vaccination
campaign. The [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s may forget about the referendum for several
years, which is good [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) for the sterling.

### Results of the UK mid-term parliamentary elections

 _Source: Financial Times._

The pound is being actively bought since more than 79% of the UK adult
population have received at least one dose of the vaccine. As well as
due to the approach of June 21, when all existing restrictions will be
completely lifted. Aberdeen Standard Investments believes that the
economy, the BoE monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), and market risks are important. If the
US dollar falls in the coming months, the company believes the GBPUSD
price will rise to level 1.45, which has not been reached since 2016.
UBS Wealth Management expects to see the pair price even higher at level
1.49 by the end of the year, thanks to a recovery in global GDP.

### [GBPUSD][1] trading plan for six months

In my opinion, despite the existing risks of a [GBPUSD][1] rollback
against the background of talks about the acceleration of US inflation
to 3.6% and higher, the GBPUSD pair trend has been defined. I recommend
holding as long as possible and periodically adding up to the long
trades entered in the levels of [1,3835][2] and [1,3925][3]. The marks
of 1.433 and 1.45 are used as 3 and 6-month targets.
