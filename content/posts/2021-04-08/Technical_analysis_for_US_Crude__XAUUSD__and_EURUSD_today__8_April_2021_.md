Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 08.04.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

Yesterday, a gold price correction to the Additional Zone 1732.9 -
1731.6 occurred. After that, major traders entered purchases.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

Yesterday, the oil price rose to the resistance level of 60.05, then
fell and rose again. The day closed in neutral territory for bulls and
bears. However, the short-term trend remains down. The target of the
trend is the Target Zone 57.13 - 56.62.

For today, it is reasonable to hold yesterday's sales, according to
trading ideas with the target at the support level of 57.35.

Oil purchases require a trend reversal by breaking out level 60.70 and a
price consolidation higher at the US trading session. In this case, the
target for long trades will be the upper Target Zone 63.26 - 62.75.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

Hold down sales entered in the zone of 59.42 - 60.45. TakeProfit: 57.35.
StopLoss: 61.00

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

Yesterday, a gold price correction to the Additional Zone 1732.9 -
1731.6 occurred. After that, major traders entered purchases, which led
to the update of the local high in the zone of ​​level 1745. Further
growth will depend on the ability of traders to break out the resistance
level of 1745. When the level is broken out, the target will be the Gold
Zone 1755 - 1752.

Look for new purchases in the zone of ​​1736 - 1734 with a stop below
yesterday's low.

For the gold sales, the bears need to break out the Additional Zone and
consolidate the price at the US trading session below.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

  1. Buy when level 1745 is broken out. TakeProfit: Gold Zone 1755 - 1752. StopLoss: 1740.5.

  2. Buy in the zone of 1736 - 1734. TakeProfit: 1745. StopLoss: 1730.4.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

A short-term euro uptrend continues. Traders are trying to break out the
Target Zone 1.1880 - 1.1864. In case of price consolidation above the
zone, the next target will be the Gold Zone 1.1952 - 1.1944.

Yesterday, a price correction down to the Additional Zone 1.1874 -
1.1870 occurred. This is a strong EURUSD intraday support. It is
profitable to enter purchases at this intraday support according to the
pattern with the target at the resistance level of 1.1907. At the
moment, the pattern is forming.

It will be relevant to sell the euro only if the support level of 1.1862
is broken out.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

Buy according to the pattern in Additional Zone 1.1874 - 1.1870.
TakeProfit: 1.1907. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.
