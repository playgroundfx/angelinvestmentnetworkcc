Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 08.04.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

Bitcoin and Ethereum have completed corrective waves. The prices should
start rising in impulse waves.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

The hourly timeframe of the BTCUSD price chart displays the impulse wave
[5] with wave 5 unfolding inside. Wave 5 is composed of the sub-waves
[1]-[2]-[3]-[4]-[5] of a smaller degree. The market must have completed
the corrective down wave [4] as a simple zigzag (A)-(B)-(C). If the
assumption is correct, the market should be rising in sub-wave [5] of a
smaller degree towards level 61800.00 over the next few days. Level
61800.00 is the previous high. One could enter purchases in the current
situation.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 56593.50, TP 61800.00

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

The most recent section of the XRPUSD price chart displays the upward
impulse, which has started after the triangle corrective wave completed.
There have completed impulse wave (1) and a short corrective wave (2).
There is now unfolding a more extended wave (3) having an impulse
structure. The market may have finished declining in correction 4, so
the price should be rising in wave 5 to a level of 1.230. One could
enter buy trades in the current situation.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] today:

Buy 0.919, TP 1.230

## Elliott wave Ethereum analysis

The most recent section of the ETHUSD chart displays the final leg of
the bullish impulse C. There is developing sub-wave (5) in the impulse
wave [5]. Wave (5) is composed of the sub-waves 1-2-3-4-5. This week,
the market seems to have finished the corrective down wave 4 composed of
the sub-waves [A]-[B]-[C]. Therefore, the Ethereum price should be
rising in sub-wave 5 to a level of 2280.00. It is relevant to enter long
positions in the current situation.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Buy 1995.28, TP 2280.00
