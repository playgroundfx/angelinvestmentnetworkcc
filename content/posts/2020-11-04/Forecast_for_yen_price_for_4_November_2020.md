Yen places its opponent in check. Analysis as of 04.11.2020Dmitri
Demidenko

Europe's and Asia's different epidemiological states, recession depths,
and monetary policies create the necessary prerequisites for a downtrend
in the [EURJPY][1]. How deep can a fall be? Let's find it out and make a
trading plan.

## Monthly fundamental forecast for yen

While the greenback is waiting for the election's final results, trading
currency cross rates may be worth considering. The US political
landscape will undoubtedly affect most currencies, but the pandemic
remains a weightier factor in Forex pricing in the medium and long
[terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/). The strategies based on the divergence in epidemiological
situations, economic growth, and monetary policies continue to yield
profits. Another confirmation is the realization of the targets at 122.9
and 121.8 set [in mid-October][2] for shorts in the [EURJPY][1].

COVID-19 hit Japan less than the eurozone: in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of Coronavirus cases
per 100,000, Japan is one of the countries that tackle the pandemic most
efficiently, along with China, Taiwan, and South Korea. The situation in
Belgium, Spain, and Italy looks gloomy, on the contrary.

### Recession and pandemic

As a result, Europe is forced to introduce new restrictions, which will
cut the eurozone's Q4 GDP by 2.3%, according to Financial Times. Thus, a
double recession is certainly in the air. The organization of economic
development and cooperation expects that the currency block's economy
will reduce 7.9% in 2020, i.e., twice as much as during the previous
global crisis. I dare suppose that the second wave may even downgrade
those forecasts.

The BoJ expects that the Japanese GDP will fall by 5.5% by the end of
the 2020/2021 fiscal year in March. Japan's economic loss doesn't look
as significant as the eurozone's since the efficiency of anti-pandemic
measures in Asia is higher than in Europe.

### GDP dynamics

Christine Lagarde is sure the ECB will expand a monetary stimulus
package in December as the coronavirus is spreading fast across Europe.
Haruhiko Kuroda and his colleagues are ready to take action if
necessary, but the BoJ's Head has not seen such a necessity so far. Both
regulators got caught in a liquidity trap where softer monetary policies
do not have any positive effect. Both agree to play currency wars, but
the ECB's intentions are manifest, and the euro is therefore falling
faster than other G10 currencies.

### Monthly trading plan for [ **EURJPY**][1]

The situation may seriously change soon: vaccines' development will
support the global economic recovery and international trade, which is
positive [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) for the euro. The European countries will lift
restrictions, and Christine Lagarde's hints about QE expansion will
remain mere hints. According to Governor of the Austrian National Bank
Robert Holzmann, there is no point in increasing buy volumes as the
inflation won't speed up anyway. Instead, a change in the QE program's
structure must be in focus.

This scenario looks too optimistic, though. But why not hope for the
best and use the [EURJPY][1]'s drawdown to 120.65 for long-term buying?
