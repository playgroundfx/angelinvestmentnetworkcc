Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 04.11.2020Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I suggest entry signals
to trade each cryptocurrency.

Ripple and Ethereum are forming the final sub-waves of the corrective
patterns. Both cryptocurrencies should be rising.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

 ****

The BTCUSD market is forming the upward impulse wave C that may conclude
the linking up wave [X], which is a double zigzag. Within the impulse
wave C, there have completed impulses [1]-[3] and corrective waves
[2]-[4]. Correction [4] is a double zigzag. Wave [5] has just started
developing, it will conclude the C wave. Therefore, the price should be
rising in wave [5] to a level of 15200.00. It is relevant to buy in the
current situation.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 13875.25, TP 15200.00

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

 ****

The XRPUSD market is forming the corrective wave B as a triple zigzag
[W]-[X]-[Y]-[X]-[Z]. The fourth leg of this pattern, wave [X] may have
completed. Wave [X] is a triple combination. There is now unfolding the
first element of the final wave [Z]. It should run up to level 0.263,
which is the previous high made by wave [Y]. Under the current
conditions, one could enter buy trades.

### Trading plan for **[XRPUSD][2]** today:

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

 ****

The ETHUSD market is forming the corrective wave B that is composed of
the sub-waves [W]-[X]-[Y]. There is now forming the bullish wave [Y] as
a triple zigzag. Within the [Y] wave, the second linking wave (xx) has
finished as a triple zigzag w-x-y-xx-z. The market should be following
the final motive wave (z) up to a level of 423.00. Next, the market
could turn down and start declining.
