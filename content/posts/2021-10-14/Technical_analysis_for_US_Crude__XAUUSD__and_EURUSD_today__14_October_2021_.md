Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 14.10.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

The short-term gold uptrend continued while the trading recommendation
to enter purchases yielded profits.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

Yesterday, oil traders worked out a corrective sell pattern in the zone
of 80.59 - 79.87, after updating October 12 low. The price didn't reach
Intermediary Zone 78.72 - 78.46.

The short-term uptrend is developing with the target at level 81.13.
After reaching this level, it is necessary to assess whether buyers will
be able to consolidate the price above the level. If successful, the
growth will continue with the target in the Gold Zone 82.64 - 82.38.

If level 81.13 is held, then a correction to strong supports will begin
again, in which one should enter purchases.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

The short-term gold uptrend continued while the trading recommendation
to enter purchases yielded profits. As a result, the October 8 high was
updated, and the Gold Zone 1786 - 1784 was reached.

The Gold Zone was broken out upside with consolidation at the US trading
session. This suggests that the uptrend is most likely to continue with
the target at Target Zone 2 1808 - 1804.

It is profitable to enter new gold purchases on correction according to
the patterns at strong supports: Additional Zone 1786 - 1785 and
Intermediary Zone 1777 - 1775.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

  1. Buy according to the pattern in Additional Zone 1786 - 1785. TakeProfit: 1795, Target Zone 2 1808 - 1804. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. Buy according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 1777 - 1775. TakeProfit: 1795, Target Zone 2 1808 - 1804. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

The short-term euro trend reversed up after the key resistance at level
1.1583 was broken out. Now the Intermediary Zone 1.1621 - 1.1612 serves
as the growth target.

Today look for long trades with the abovementioned target. It is
profitable to enter trades on the correction in the zone of 1.1579 -
1.1552.

After reaching the IZ, wait for the zone to be held. In this case, the
price will go into correction. If the zone is broken out, a new buy
target will appear.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

Buy in the zone of 1.1579 - 1.1552. TakeProfit: Intermediary Zone 1.1621
- 1.1612. StopLoss: 1.1546.
