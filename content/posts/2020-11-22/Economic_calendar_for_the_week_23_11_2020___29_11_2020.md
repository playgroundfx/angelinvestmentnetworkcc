Economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the week 23.11.2020 – 29.11.2020Jana Kane

##  **Review of the main events of the Forex economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the
next trading week (23.11.2020 – 29.11.2020)**

 **Trading on key Forex [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/): next week we are expecting the publication
of important macro statistics from Germany, Eurozone, the UK, Australia,
and the US.**

American stock indices remained at their opening levels last week.
However, the US dollar nevertheless fell by the results of the past
week. The optimism of market participants is supported by hopes for an
early appearance of an effective vaccine against coronavirus and the
commitment of the world's largest central banks to extra-soft monetary
policies.

Despite the alarming rate of increase in the number of coronavirus cases
in the world, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s still hope for a rapid V-shaped recovery of the
global economy and continued growth in stock markets.

At the same time, the uncertainty reigning in the financial markets does
not allow stock indices and commodity quotes to develop a more rapid
ascent.

 **Traders should pay attention to the publication of the following
macro indicators:**

 ***during the coming week, new events may be added to the [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) and
/ or some scheduled events may be canceled**

 **Monday, November 23**

 **08:30 EUR Germany Markit Economics Manufacturing PMI (preliminary
release). Markit Economics Composite PMI (preliminary release)**

Germany's Manufacturing PMI is an important indicator of the business
environment and the overall health of the German economy. This sector of
the economy forms a significant part of Germany's GDP. A result above 50
is considered positive and strengthens the EUR, below 50 - as negative
for the euro. Forecast for November (preliminary release): 56.5.

Previous values: 58.2 in October, 56.4 in September, 52.2 in August,
51.0 in July, 45.2 in June, 36.6 in May, 34.5 in April, 45.4 in March ,
48 in February, 45.3 in January, which indicates a continuing recovery
in business activity in this sector of the German economy, although the
average value for several months is still below 50. Despite the relative
decline, the value of the indicator above 50 is still likely to support
the euro (in the short term). The data worse than expected and
especially the value below 50 will have a negative impact on the euro.

Composite PMI for the German economy is an important indicator of the
business environment and the overall health of the German economy. A
result above 50 is considered positive and strengthens the EUR, below 50
- as negative for the euro. Forecast for November (preliminary release):
50.1 vs 55.0 in October, 54.7 in September, 54.4 in August, 55.3 in
July, 47.0 in June, 32.3 in May, 17. 4 in April, 35 in March, 50.7 in
February, 51.2 in January. The publication of this indicator with the
specified expected value is likely to support the euro in the short
term. The data worse than the forecast and below the value of 50.0, as a
rule, have a negative impact on the euro.

 **09:00 EUR Markit Economics Composite Manufacturing PMI (preliminary
release)**

Eurozone's Manufacturing PMI is an important indicator of the health of
the entire European economy. A result above 50 is considered positive
and strengthens the EUR, below 50 - as negative for the euro. Forecast
for November (preliminary release): 46.1 (against 50.0 in October, 50.4
in September, 51.9 in August, 54.9 in July, 48.5 in June, 31.9 in May,
13 , 6 in April, 29.7 in March, 51.6 in February, 51.3 in January),
which may have a short-term negative impact on the euro. If the data
turns out to be worse than forecast, the euro may fall sharply in the
short term.

 **09:30 GBP UK Markit Economics Services PMI (preliminary release)**

UK's Services PMI is an important indicator of the health of the UK
economy. The service sector employs most of the UK's working-age
population and accounts for approximately 78% of GDP. Financial services
are still the most important part of the services industry. If the data
turns out to be worse than the forecast and the previous value, the
pound is likely to drop sharply in the short term. The data better than
the forecast and the previous value will have a positive impact on the
pound. At the same time, the result above 50 is considered positive and
strengthens the GBP, below 50 - as negative for the GBP.

Previous values ​​of the indicator: 51.4 in October, 56.1 in September,
58.8 in August, 56.5 in July, 47.1 in June, 29.0 in May, 13.4 in April,
34.5 in March, 53.2 in February, 53.9 in January. Preliminary forecast
for November: 42.5, which is likely to have a negative impact on the
pound.

 **Tuesday, November 24**

 **00:30 AUD Balance of trade**

This indicator measures the ratio of Australia's export and import
volumes. Growth in Australian exports leads to an increase in trade
surplus, which has a positive impact on the AUD. Previous value
(September) was AU$ 5.630 billion. A decrease in the trade surplus may
negatively affect the Australian dollar. Vice versa, a growing trade
surplus is a positive factor for the AUD.

 **12:05 JPY Speech by the Head of the Bank of Japan Haruhiko Kuroda**

During his speech, the head of the Bank of Japan Kuroda is likely to
give comments on the bank's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). Following the meeting, the
Board of the Bank of Japan, by a majority vote, decided to leave the key
rate at -0.1%, and the target level of yield on 10-year government bonds
- at zero. The bank did not change its earlier guidelines for further
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) and reiterated that it will keep interest rates
extremely low "for an extended period." "It is necessary to patiently
continue to ease monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)," said the Governor of the Bank of
Japan Haruhiko Kuroda. Markets tend to react actively to Kuroda's
speeches when he touches on monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). Volatility at such moments
usually grows not only in the yen trade, but throughout the Asian and
global financial markets. If he doesn't touch on monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) issues,
the reaction to his speech will be weak.

 **22:00 NZD Speech by the head of the RBNZ Adrian Orr**

Speeches by the head of the RBNZ often serve as an unofficial source of
information on the future direction of the central bank's monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).

Earlier, the RBNZ stated that against the background of "many factors of
uncertainty" monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) "will remain soft for the foreseeable
future," but "may be adjusted accordingly." For a stable recovery of the
New Zealand economy and rising inflation, "a weaker NZ dollar is
needed."

It is likely that the head of the RBNZ Adrian Orr will reaffirm the
bank's propensity to pursue a soft monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), which will lead to
continued pressure on the New Zealand currency.

In any case, volatility is expected to increase in the New Zealand
dollar trade during the RBNZ press conference.

 **13:30 USD Durable goods orders. Capital goods orders (ex defense and
aviation)**

This indicator reflects the value of orders received by manufacturers of
durable goods and capital goods (capital goods are durable commodities
used to produce durable goods and services) involving large investments.
Commodities produced in the defense and aviation sectors of the US
economy are not included in this indicator. A strong result strengthens
the USD. Previous values ​​of the indicator "orders for durable goods":
+1.9% in September, +0.5% in August, +11.7% in July, +7.7% in June,
+15.0% in May , -18.3% in April, -16.7% in March, +2.0% in February,
-0.2% in January.

Previous values ​​of the indicator "orders for capital goods ex defense
and aviation": +1.0% in September, +1.9% in August, +2.5% in July, +4.3%
in June, +1.5% in May, -6.6% in April, -1.3% in March, -0.6% in
February, +0.9% in January.

In theory, the relative growth of the indicator has a positive effect on
the dollar; the market reaction to its negative value may be negative
for the dollar in the short term. Data worse than the previous value
will also have a negative impact on dollar quotes.

Forecast for October: +1.0 %% (orders for durable goods), +0.5% (orders
for capital goods ex defense and aviation).

It looks like the indicators are declining again after their recovery in
previous months from the strong fall in March and April, which may
negatively affect the dollar quotes. The slightly better-than-expected
data is also unlikely to have a long-term positive impact on the dollar.

 **13:30 USD US Annual GDP for 3rd quarter (second estimate)**

GDP data is one of the key indicators (along with labor market and
inflation data) for the Fed in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of its monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). Strong
result strengthens US dollar; weak GDP report negatively affects the US
dollar. In the previous 2nd quarter, GDP declined by -31.4% after
growing by 2.1% in the 3rd and 4th quarters of 2019.

If the data points to another strong decline in GDP in the 3rd quarter,
then the dollar will be under pressure. Positive data on GDP will
support the dollar and US stock indices. The preliminary estimate of GDP
growth in the 3rd quarter was +33.1%.

 **19:00 USD Minutes of the November meeting of the Federal Open Market
Committee**

The publication of the minutes is extremely important for determining
the course of the current Fed [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) and the prospects for raising
interest rates in the United States. The volatility of trading in
financial markets during the publication of the minutes usually
increases, since the text often contains either changes or clarifying
details regarding the results of the last FOMC Fed meeting.

Recently, more and more often one can hear statements from the Fed
leaders indicating the Fed's inclination to continue the extra-soft
stimulating [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).

"Economic activity continued to rebound, however, the pace of
improvement has slowed," Chairman of the Fed Jerome Powell said at a
press conference following a regular Fed meeting in early November,
again calling on the government to strengthen fiscal stimulus measures.

The soft tone of the minutes will have a positive effect on stock
indices and negatively on the US dollar. Tough rhetoric of the Fed
leaders regarding the prospects for monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) will push the dollar
to further growth.

It is possible that the minutes will contain some information on the
plans of the Fed leaders at the meeting on December 15-16.

 **Thursday, November 26**

No important macro statistics releases planned for this day. The USA
celebrates Thanksgiving Day. From this day begins the festive season,
which includes Catholic Christmas and New Year. Banks and exchanges in
this country will be closed, which will lead to lower trading volumes,
especially during the American trading session.

 **Friday, November 27**

No important macro statistics releases planned for this day.
