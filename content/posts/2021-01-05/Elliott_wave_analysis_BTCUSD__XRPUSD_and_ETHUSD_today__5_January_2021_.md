Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 05.01.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I suggest entry signals
to trade each cryptocurrency.

The BTCUSD and ETHUSD market structures are similar. There are forming
upward impulses, with bearish corrective waves developing inside.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

The BTCUSD price chart displays the bullish impulse, with the final
fifth wave developing inside. The fifth wave is composed of the sub-
waves 1-2-3-4-5. The upward impulse wave 3 must have finished. The
market has started declining following wave 4. Correction 4 should be
unfolding as a standard zigzag [a]-[b]-[c]. The final wave [c] may draw
the price slightly lower than the previous low made by the [a] impulse.
Therefore, the market should be declining in the near future, and one
could enter sell trades.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Sell 32411.50 TP 27680.00

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

 ****

The XRPUSD chart displays the structure of the bearish wave (W), which
is forming as a simple zigzag A-B-C. The upward corrective wave B has
recently finished; its deep corrective wave [B] is a triple zigzag. The
price is now gradually declining in the impulse down wave C. The first
four legs of the C wave look complete. There is likely to be forming the
fifth wave of impulse [5] that is the final wave in wave C. The price
could continue falling to a level of 0.100. Therefore, it is relevant to
enter short positions.

### Trading plan for **[XRPUSD][2]** today:

Sell 0.231, TP 0.100

## Elliott wave Ethereum analysis

The hourly ETHUSD chart displays the final leg of the large bullish
impulse. The corrective wave 4 completed as a triple zigzag in the
second half of 2020. Next, the price started rising in the upward
impulse wave 5. The sub-waves [i]-[ii]-[iii]-[iv] have ended within wave
5; the price has been sharply rising in the final impulse [v], which
looks more powerful than other sub-waves of the same degree. There might
be forming the zigzag-shaped corrective wave (iv), which could end at a
level of around the previous low at 878.49. Next, the sub-wave (v) will
conclude the entire impulse [v].

### Trading plan for  **[ETHUSD][3] **today:

Sell 1074.32, TP 878.49
