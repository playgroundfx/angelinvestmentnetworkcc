Fundamental analysisMikhail Hypov

Fundamental analysis in the stock market is considered to be a complex
tool. The most successful [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s in [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/), such as George Soros and
Warren Buffett, made up their capitals employing fundamental analysis.
This article is an ultimate guide to fundamental analysis in trading
Forex. Read on, and you will learn [how to](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-trading-how-to/) utilize the best methods and
tools of fundamental analysis!

The article covers the following subjects:

## What is Fundamental Analysis?

Fundamental analysis is a way to predict future asset prices based on
external events and facts. These events and facts are the fundamental
factors of the economy. Fundamental factors include:

  * economic indicators, for example, central banks’ interest rates, GDP changes, inflation and deflation rates, employment;

  * economic outlook;

  * political factors;

  * [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) and rumors;

  * seasonal factors;

  * industries’ correlation;

  * economic cycles and other regularities.

Fundamental analysis aims to spot the maximum number of essential
factors to determine the market’s likely prices.

## Fundamental Analysis vs. Technical Analysis: What’s the Difference?

The primary difference between fundamental and technical analysis is in
the methods of forecasts. Fundamental analysis suggests a detailed study
of the financial and economic state of both the subject of the research
itself and the outer environment. Technical analysis implies exploring
only the price chart to identify patterns or trends, employing a wide
range of technical indicators.

Fundamental analysis allows you to identify the fair price of assets and
understand how they are undervalued or overvalued at the current time.
Fundamental analysis is a method of determining a stock's real or "fair
market" value. The key goal of technical tools is to identify trends and
patterns, relevant points to enter and exit trades.

There are also differences in time frames. Fundamental analysis is
suitable for long-term investments and fundamental trading, while
technical analysis is focused on short-term and medium-term trading.

## Components of Fundamental Analysis

Fundamental analysis consists of three key elements:

  * Economic analysis;

  * Industry analysis;

  * Company analysis.

Let us study each of these elements in more detail.

## Top-down vs. Bottom-up Fundamental Analysis

There are two major approaches to fundamental analysis in Forex:

Let us explore each of the approaches in more detail:

### Top-down Fundamental Analysis

As you see from the above figure, the top-down approach starts with
analyzing the global economy and the country’s economy. As a rule, you
study factors such as GDP, inflation, interest rate, and the correlation
of foreign exchange rates.

After you have analyzed the macroeconomic outlook, you explore the
economic sectors of interest and particular industries. Based on the
research, you can choose the most promising investment [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/). At the
final stage, you carry out a fundamental analysis of individual
companies’ stocks.

### Bottom-up approach

As you see from the above figure, the bottom-up approach suggests
analyzing data in the opposite order. That is, you first analyze the
securities of a company, its financial statements; next comes the
industry and economic sector. At the final stage, you explore the
macroeconomic factor relative to the selected companies.

Investors employing the bottom up approach usually believe that
particular securities could work out better than the industry or an
economic sector as a whole. They explore in detail the performance of
each selected company to invest in the most promising assets.

## Quantitative and Qualitative Fundamental Analysis

The various fundamental factors can be grouped into two categories:
quantitative and qualitative.  Quantitative fundamental analysis
involves researching the securities market based on statistical and
financial data, as well as measurable characteristics of a business.
Quantitative analysis is often employed in algorithmic trading
strategies to manage the risks and assess the potential return on
investment portfolios.

The fundamental qualitative analysis explores less tangible data. They
could be political and economic relations between countries, corporate
culture, consumer expectations, brand-name recognition, the correlation
between different processes and patterns. For example, a trader likes
the company’s products, like Apple, or the company’s key executives,
like Tesla.

## Key performance indicators

There is no strict algorithm to analyze economic data. I can define
particular fundamental indicators, which are key performance indicators
or KPI. Some financial performance indicators are:

  * The ROE indicator;

  * The P/E ratio;

  * The Beta coefficient– Beta (β);

  * Earnings per share (EPS);

  * Price/Balance ratio – (P/B Ratio);

  * The PEG ratio;

  * P/S ratio;

  * The dividend payout ratio ;

  * The dividend yield.

All these indicators convey the information on some economic processes.
By comparing these factors, the [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) assesses the performance of the
company or the industry. So, the trader reduces the risks of making a
losing transaction.

### Return on Equity (ROE)

The return on equity is one of the critical elements of fundamental
analysis. It determines how efficiently the company uses the capital of
its shareholders. The ROE is calculated by dividing equity capital by
the company's net profit using the formula:

ROE = Net_Income/Equity * 100%,

Where:

For example, if the company earned 10 million euros this year, and the
equity is 100 million, the return on equity will be:

ROE = 10 000 000/100 000 000 * 100% = 10%.

The indicator is useful when comparing participants in the same industry
or the dynamics of ROE changes over several years. It makes no sense to
compare companies from different sectors in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of this indicator. The
specifics of the market have a strong influence on the company's
profitability.

### Price-to-Earnings Ratio (P/E Ratio)

Investors use the Price-to-earnings (P / E) ratio in fundamental
analysis to evaluate companies. It determines how much their stock is
undervalued or overvalued. To calculate it, you need to divide the
current share price by earnings per share. The latter is calculated by
dividing the annual profit by the number of securities issued.

P/E ratio is calculated according to the formula:

P/E = Price / EPS,

Where:

Sometimes, the price to earnings ratio is described in trading as the
company’s capitalization. It means the total value of all securities
divided by the net profit. The information provided by the indicator and
total value or the shareholders equity won’t change.

In practice, the P/E ratio is often calculated using the expected net
profit. This happens when the company’s analysts project the net profit.
In this case, the market will consider the expected profit, and the P/E
will be revised.

### Beta (β)

A beta coefficient in fundamental analysis measures the correlation of
an asset to movements in the overall market or industry. It means how
the asset price depends on the general market tendencies. For example, a
stock could be compared to a benchmark stock index, such as NASDAQ or
S&P 500.

Beta coefficient calculation formula:

Where:

  * Cov (k, p) – covariance of the return;

  * k_i – the return of individual stock i;

  * p – the return of the portfolio.

For you to understand it better, I will present another, more complex
formula:

Where:

  * k ̀ – expected (average) stock return;

  * p_i – i-portfolio return (a stock index return over period i)

  * p ̀ – expected (average) portfolio return;

  * n – the number of observations.

Coefficient values:

  *  **More than 1.** The stock price correlates (moves in the same direction) with the stock index. The stock is more sensitive (rise or fall faster) to the stock index’s value changes.

  *  **The Beta of a stock equals to 1.** The stock’s price movements repeat the movement of the index with 100% accuracy.

  *  **From 0 to 1.** An individual stock correlates with the stock index. The stock price is less sensitive to the stock index.

  *  **The Beta is 0.** The stock doesn’t correlate with the index. It means the value of an individual stock doesn’t depend on the stock index price movements.

  *  **From -1 to 0.** The stock price has a negative correlation with the stock index. It means the individual stock moves in the opposite direction of a stock index. The equity’s price is less sensitive to the average market moves than the stock index.

  *  **Less than – 1.** The stock has a negative correlation with the index. The volatility of such equity is higher than that of a stock index.  

### Earnings Per Share (EPS)

EPS shows the company’s profitability. It is calculated by dividing the
company's net income by its total number of outstanding shares.

EPS = NetIncome/TCSO,

Where:

In some types of analysis, to estimate the shares of the companies with
complex capital structure, Diluted EPS is used. The difference from the
usual EPS is that the net profit is divided by the adjusted number of
shares. Securities such as convertible [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/), warrants, bonds are
deducted from the base number of common shares.

### Price-to-Book Ratio (P/B Ratio)

Price-to-Book Ratio (P/B Ratio) helps determine if the company’s stock
is undervalued compared to its intrinsic value. The P/B ratio compares a
company's market capitalization, or market value, to its book value.
Book value is the value of the company's total assets without total
liabilities.

The P/B formula:

P/B = Price/BVR,

where:

P/B shows what property the [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) will acquire by investing a
notional dollar in the firm. It is close in meaning to book value per
share.

### Price-Earnings-Growth Ratio (PEG)

PEG is a variation on the previously discussed P/E Ratio. The multiplier
is calculated by the formula:

Where:

The multiplier considers the expected future return. It is used to
determine the appropriateness of the price that an [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) is willing
to pay for income growth in the future.

### Price-to-sales ratio (P/S)

The P/S ratio measures the volume of sales. It is calculated using the
formula:

P/S = Price/Sales_Ratio,

Where:

The P/S ratio helps to understand how much an [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) should pay for
each dollar received from sales. The nature of this parameter is similar
to the P/E ratio. However, it is thought to be less accurate since it
does not take into account operating costs. Nonetheless, the volume of
sales updates more often and is easier to predict.

### Dividend Payout Ratio

The Dividend Payout Ratio is the percentage of earnings paid to
shareholders in dividends.

The common calculation formula looks like this:

DPR = Total_Dividents/Net_Income,

where:

Using this coefficient, you can determine the company’s dividend [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
and indirectly estimate a security yield.

### Dividend Yield

The dividend yield, expressed as a percentage, is a financial ratio
(dividend/price). The DY shows how much a company pays out in dividends
each year relative to its stock price. The reciprocal of the dividend
yield is the price/dividend ratio.

The dividend yield is calculated according to the formula:

DY = Dividend/Price of share * 100%

Dividend Yield is a convenient way to measure the cash profit made from
every dollar invested. Or, to put it simply, the return on the
investment.

## Examples of Fundamental Analysis

Let me explain the evaluation of the financial key indicators on the
example of Microsoft.

So, over the past year, the value of MSFT stocks has increased
significantly despite the pandemic and lockdowns. At the same time, over
the past three months, the price has varied within +/- 4%. I would like
to know how the Microsoft stock price will change in the future.

I use the free service[ simplywall.st][1] and see that the P/E ratio,
measuring the payback period for MSFT is 34.1 years (blue arrow). It is
shorter than the average payback period in the industry, 51.4 years
(turquoise arrow). On the one hand, it means that the stock is
potentially undervalued. On the other hand, it could suggest possible
fundamental problems limiting the demand for the stocks and pressing
down the cash flows.

The chart also represents the P/E of the market, but it makes no sense
to compare the previous data with these ones. The average market P/E
indicates the overall state of overbought of the high tech industry in
general, rather than of a particular company.

The PEG of 3.2 is a low value. It means that the high market price of
the Microsoft stock pays back only partially.

The P/B value is 13.1. It is more than six-fold greater than the US
market average and 1.5 times more than the industry average. High P/B
means that the Microsoft stock is overvalued.



The return on equity (ROE) is also high, at 38.5%. The average ROE in
the industry is 12.6%.

Having explored the key performance indicators, I can suggest that
Microsoft stocks are valued higher than the market. High ROE and steady
long-term uptrend mean that [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are optimistic and expect the
company’s stock’s future growth. With this regard, the MSFT P/E is lower
than the average industrial indicator.

So, the stock is undervalued compared to the rivals, and its true value
could be higher. So, using fundamental analysis valuation, I could
recommend buying the Microsoft stocks.

## The Best Research Tools for Fundamental Analysis

It is difficult to carry out the fundamental analysis in Forex, stock,
or futures market if you manually calculate all the indicators. Forex
technical analysts use the price chart indicators to predict the price
trends of the[ EURUSD][2] or any other currency pair. Likewise, stock
traders can employ screeners to define the most promising assets and
profitable investments.

You don’t necessarily need to use the paid service simplywall.st. There
are many free stock screeners. I will present the top stock screeners
below:

####  **Finviz**

The Finviz screener is popular among [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s. It has many filters, it
is easy to custom, and it has a free version. The service analyzes the
performance of thousands of companies from all over the world, including
those, which are not famous among traders.

####  **Yahoo! Finance**

It is another tool that will be useful in fundamental analysis of the
Forex and the stock market. Yahoo! Finance is the provider of financial
information. In addition to the stock screener and fundamental stock
analysis.

It provides a lot of useful information about financial markets. You
will find currency quotes, securities [ranking](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/crypto-exchange-ranking/)s, financial reports of
companies, press releases.

## Criticisms of Fundamental Analysis pros and cons. Disadvantages of
Fundamental Analysis.

Fundamental analysis Forex helps [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s gather financial information
essential to understand current market trends and estimate the potential
price growth. Fundamental analysis is useful to make long-term forecasts
and evaluate the prospects of an asset. Unlike technical analysis,
fundamental analysis can’t be used to detail optimal entry points to
open positions.

The major flaw is the absence of exact facts and figures. Whatever
methods of fundamental study you employ, you will have only general
assumptions as an output. Technical analysis tools, conversely, often
operate with exact numbers.

## Conclusion

Considering the pros and cons of fundamental analysis, professional
traders often combine several approaches to studying financial markets.
Fundamental factors are used to estimate the prospects. Technical
indicators serve to define good points to enter and exit trades. A
combined technique lowers the risks as it takes into account a more
comprehensive range of factors.
