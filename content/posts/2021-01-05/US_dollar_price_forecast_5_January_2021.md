Dollar tries to be the first to wake up. Forecast as of 05.01.2021Dmitri
Demidenko

The market is gradually waking up after the holidays and remembers about
politics and COVID-19. The December euphoria is fading away, and safe
havens could rise up amid the change in [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s’ sentiment. Let us
discuss the Forex outlook and make up a [EURUSD][1] trading plan.

## Quarterly US dollar fundamental forecast

The [EURUSD][1] bulls were trying to push the price up above 1.23 but
faced a serious obstacle – a drop in the US stock indexes. In 2020, the
USD index was 7% down amid an increase in the global risk appetite,
hopes for the global economic recovery, and the Fed’s ultra-easy
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). In early 2021, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are not that confident in the
former drivers. There is the second round of elections in Georgia; there
are problems with vaccine production. Furthermore, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s have
realized that the Fed is not the only one to affect forex rates. All
these factors could make the greenback more appealing for traders. I
don’t think the dollar’s growth will be continuous.

### Dynamics of USD index

Rising chances of Democratic candidates to win two seats in the Senate
ahead of the vote should have been a bullish factor for the [S&P
500][2]. A ‘blue wave’ will make additional fiscal stimulus more likely.
In December, Joe Biden said that $ 900 billion was just the beginning;
the economy needed more financial support. However, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are
concerned about potential tax increases and stricter tax rules. And the
political uncertainty is still a problem. Furthermore, the forecasts for
the US employment in December are rather gloomy (Wall Street Journal
experts expect the indicator will turn down from +245,000 to 68,000).
So, the drop of the US stock indexes seems natural.

Moreover, the number of hospitalizations in the United States is rising,
and the European countries are tightening lockdowns. Yes, the optimism
about vaccines pushed the manufacturing PMIs in the US and euro area up
to the highest levels since September 2014 and May 2018, respectively.
However, the services sector, which accounts for about 80% of the US and
euro-area economies, is still pressed down. Investors understand that
COVID-19 vaccines will provide results sometime later, and the present
situation is still difficult. Furthermore, vaccine production and
logistics problems are worsened by labor shortages.  Many contract
manufacturers are trying to fill roles that often require years of
experience in pharmaceutical manufacturing or biotechnology-related
degrees.

The economic recovery is set back, which could increase the demand for
safe-haven assets. Investors doubt that the Fed’s ultra-easy monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) will provide as much support for the USD bears in 2021 as it did
in 2020. According to Bloomberg research, more than 90% of central banks
will hold interest rates at the current levels or even cut them.

### Quarterly [EURUSD][1] trading plan

Traders still focus on the Fed’s [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), and so, any achievements of the
[EURUSD][1] bears should be temporary. Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago
President Charles Evans said the U.S. central bank shouldn’t be shy
about letting inflation run above 3%. Evans says he will consider the
PCE rise as a temporary improvement resulted from the economic recovery
after the pandemic. If other Fed’s governors share the same opinion, the
central bank won’t hike the federal funds rate before 2024. It is still
relevant to buy the euro on the corrections with the targets at
$1.25-$1.27.
