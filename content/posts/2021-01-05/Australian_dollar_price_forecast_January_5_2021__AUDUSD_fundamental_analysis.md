Aussie got one of the standing ovations. Forecast as of 05.01.2021Dmitri
Demidenko

The [AUDUSD][1] rally should continue this year amid support from China
and the commodity market. The major risk is Joe Biden’s attacks on
China. However, I don’t think the US-China trade relations will worsen.
Let us discuss the AUD outlook and make up an [AUDUSD][1] trading plan.

## Quarterly Australian dollar fundamental forecast

The Australian dollar is trading up in early 2021, just like it was in
late 2020. The tailwinds from China and the optimism in the commodity
market allowed the [AUDUSD][1] bulls to push the price above the bottom
figure 77, the level last seen in April 2018. Although Bloomberg experts
do not include the Aussie in the list of G10 best-performers, the AUD
should be rising in the first few months of the new year unless
something unexpected happens.

China’s manufacturing PMI was 51.9 in December, services PMI was 55.7.
The purchasing managers’ indexes were slightly down compared to November
figures, but they are still above 50, which means the Chinese economy
has been expanding over the last few months. Large banks increase the
expected Chinese GDP growth. For example, Goldman Sachs suggests China’s
economy should expand by 2.4%, up from the previous gauge of 2%, in
2020; in 2021, the GDP would grow by 8%, up from the previously expected
7.5%. Considering a downturn in the US GDP in the first quarter, the
growth gap will support the yuan’s strengthening, supporting the
[AUDUSD][1] bulls.

### Dynamics of Australian dollar and Chinese yuan

The [USDCNH][2] has been below level 6.5 for the first time since
mid-2018. According to Schroders, the pair continues falling amid higher
interest rates in China and the US and the increase in China’s current
account surplus. Furthermore, foreign [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s’ demand for China’s
assets is also up, as traders want to diversify their portfolios in
favor of non-American securities.

Despite the deterioration of diplomatic relations between Canberra and
Beijing, a full-fledged trade war should not start. China’s import
tariffs do not affect the key elements of Australia’s exports. And there
are some reasons.

Australia is the largest iron ore producer, the demand for which is
constantly rising in the Asian economy. China produces nearly half of
the world's steel, and the production volumes are rising at a record
pace. According to the World Steel Association, China’s steel production
increased by 8% Y-o-Y and reached 87.7 million tonnes in November.
Simultaneously, the deadly landslide in Brazil and the approach of the
annual cyclone season in Australia increase the risks of production cuts
and keep futures near the highest levels since 2011.

JP Morgan raised its forecast for average iron prices in 2021 by 20% to
$126 per tonne; Jefferies Financial Group expects that in the first
quarter, the iron price will fluctuate in the range of $180-$200 per
tonne. However, Capital Economics and Citigroup suggest Chinese demand
for iron ore should decline while the production will rise, which will
push the futures prices down to $100 per tonne. If so, the support for
the AUD will be replaced by the pressure.

### Quarterly [AUDUSD][1] trading plan

After all, the [AUDUSD][1] bulls will be going ahead in the first
quarter. A potential rise of political risks in the USA could press the
pair down. We could enter long trades on the correction with the targets
at 0.79 and 0.82.
