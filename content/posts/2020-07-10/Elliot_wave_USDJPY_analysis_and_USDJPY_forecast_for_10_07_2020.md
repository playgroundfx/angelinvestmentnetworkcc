USD/JPY: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 10.07.2020 –
17.07.2020Alex Geuta

## [USD/JPY][1] pair is in correction, remains likely to decline.
Estimated pivot point is at the level of 107.81.

 **Main scenario:**  consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 107.81 with the target in 106.00 – 105.21.

 **Alternative scenario:** **** breakout and consolidation above the
level of 107.81 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of
108.60 – 109.84.

 **Analysis:** on the [USD/JPY][1] [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame, apparently a
descending correction of larger degree finished forming as wave B and
wave С started developing with the first wave 1 of (1) of C completed
inside. On the H4 timeframe, a descending correction is developing as
wave 2 of (1) in the form of a double zigzag wxy. On the H1 timeframe,
wave (c) of y of 2 is developing with wave iii of (c) forming inside. If
the presumption is correct, the decline of the pair will continue to the
levels of 106.00 – 105.21. The level of 107.81 is critical in this
scenario. Its breakout will allow the pair to continue rising to the
levels of 108.60 – 109.84.
