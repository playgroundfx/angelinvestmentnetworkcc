USD/CAD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 10.07.2020 –
17.07.2020Alex Geuta

## [USD/CAD][1] pair is in correction, remains likely to decrease.
Estimated pivot point is at the level of 1.3712.

 **Main scenario:** consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 1.3712 with the target in 1.3315 – 1.3189.

 **Alternative scenario:** ****breakout and consolidation above the
level of 1.3712 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of
1.4052 – 1.4138.

 **Analysis:**  on the [USD/CAD][1] [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) timeframe, a downward
correction is developing as the fourth wave of a larger degree (4). A
downward impulse is formed on the 4-hour timeframe as wave C of (4),
which includes wave iv of C and the developing wave v of C. began. On
the H1 timeframe, wave (i) of v has been formed and local correction as
wave (ii) of v is at its end. If the assumption is correct, the pair
will continue to decline to the levels of 1.3315 - 1.3189. The level of
1.3712 is critical in this scenario. Its breakout will allow the pair to
continue rising to the levels of 1.4052 – 1.4138.
