EUR/USD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 10.07.20 – 17.07.20Alex
Geuta

## [EUR/USD][1] pair is in correction, remains likely to decrease.
Estimated pivot point is at the level of 1.1371.

 **Main scenario:** consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 1.1371 with the target in 1.1155 – 1.1075.

 **Alternative scenario:** ****breakout and consolidation above the
level of 1.1371 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of
1.1495 – 1.1605.

 **Analysis:**  supposedly, a descending correction of a larger degree
finished developing on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame in the form of wave 2 and
the third wave 3 started developing. On the H4 time frame the inceptive
wave 1 of (3) of a new trend is forming, with wave iii of 1 forming
inside. On the H1 timeframe, a local correction is developing as a
fourth wave iv of 1 with wave (b) of iv forming inside and wave (c) of
iv developing. If the presumption is correct, the pair will continue to
decline to the levels of 1.1155 – 1.1075. The level of 1.1371 is
critical in this scenario. Its breakout will allow the pair to continue
rising to the levels of 1.1495 – 1.1605.
