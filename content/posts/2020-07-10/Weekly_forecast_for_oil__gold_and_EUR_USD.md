Weekly forecast for oil, gold and EUR/USDAlex Rodiоnov

##  **O** **il price forecast for next wee** **k: USCrude analysis**

This week, oil buyers have not broken out the strong resistance Target
Zone 5 [41.67 – 40.92]. The oil prices have started a correction down in
the middle-term uptrend. The correction target could be the trend key
support [33.64 – 32.86].

When the key support is tested, I suggest entering new buy trades
according to the pattern. The buy target will be to break through the
high of June.

While the oil market is being corrected down, we can look for a sell
entry. For example, it is clear from the chart that the bears have
broken out the support zone of the intraday trend. One could enter a
sell at the current prices with a stop above the zone.

##  **Gold** **price forecast for next wee** **k:** **XAUUSD**
**analysis** ****

This week, gold has reached the resistance Target Zone 6 [1817.2 –
1811.2] in the middle-term uptrend. The price is now correcting, rolling
down from the resistance.

To enter new middle-term gold buy trades, I suggest expecting the test
of the trend key support at [1736.1 - 1727.9]. After the test, we shall
look for a buy pattern. The upside target could be at the high of this
week.

TakeProfit: 1788.0, Target Zone 6 [1817.2 - 1811.2]. StopLoss: according
to the pattern rules.

##  **E** **uro/dollar price forecast for next wee** **k:** **EURUSD**
**analysis** ****

This week, the EURUSD bulls have broken through the high of June 23, but
they haven’t broken out the resistance Target Zone [1.1368 – 1.1350].
However, the EURUSD market sentiment is bullish, according to technical
analysis. I expect the price to break through the high of July 9 and
break out the resistance TZ next week.

Therefore, for next week, I recommend holding up middle-term purchases
that were entered last week, according to the trading recommendations.
The upside target is 1.1410.

It will be relevant to sell the euro versus dollar if the price breaks
out level 1.1410. If so, we shall enter sell trades at the retest of the
zone of [1.1240 – 1.1220] with the sell target at the lower Target Zone
2 [1.1058 — 1.1040].

###  **[EURUSD][6]  Trading tips for the upcoming week:**

Hold up buy trades entered last week. TakeProfit: 1.1410. StopLoss:
1.1180.

> IZ - Intermediary Zone: responsible for the price momentum reversing

>

> TZ - Target Zone: a zone that is 75% likely to be reached after IZ
breakout.

>

> GZ - Gold Zone: zone in the medium-term momentum.

>

> All zones are calculated based on the average [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) price of the
instrument and margin requirements of the futures.
