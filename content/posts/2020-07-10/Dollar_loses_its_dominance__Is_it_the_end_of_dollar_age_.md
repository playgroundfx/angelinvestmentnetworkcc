End of Dollar AgeDmitri Demidenko

## Forex leader is going to be different: euro and yuan can replace the
US dollar

New regimes start during the time of great turmoil. The coronavirus
pandemic has become such a turmoil for the global economy. It thought
that COVID-19 mostly kills elderly patients with other accompanying
diseases. The world’s economy has been really old, the expansion stage
lasted for a long time, US economic expansion was the longest in
[history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/). And there are many accompanying problems. For example, the
excessive corporate debt, the excessive dependence on the US dollar, the
inability to imagine the oil market without the intervention of OPEC +,
and the endless ultra-easy monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). Is it time for a new regime
to start?

Everything is alright with solving the problems. But hardly anyone
succeeds in not creating the problems. When the Fed, managing the
economic recession, surprised the financial markets with a sharp
interest rate cut and the huge size of the QE, it was considered insane.
Next, the Fed was praised, and then reproached for too gloomy forecasts.
After that, the Fed was again praised without any reason, just looking
at the US stock indexes rally. The markets long ago realized that the US
president can’t lose his wisdom... No one can lose what he doesn’t have.
The size of the stimulating measures is not the most important, the most
important is to take control over COVID-19. The euro area managed to do
it, it turned out to be a good manager…

While Washington was looking for someone to put the blame for the
pandemic, the EU countries imposed strict lockdown. The US paid money to
the unemployed, while the euro area prohibited to dismiss employees. As
a result, US unemployment rose to the highest levels since the end of
World War II, but it didn’t much change in the euro-area. The lockdown
in the Eurozone was stricter than in the US, and the USA is now facing
the second wave, while Europe has avoided it so far. The EU governments
are willing to support the euro-area economy, which strengthens the
euro.

One of the early signs of the new regime has become a change in the
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) views of the central banks. Earlier, it was beneficial
for the ECB to hold the euro weak, as it supported the export-led euro-
area economy. Now, the euro’s strength is the result of good management
in the battle with COVID-19 and economic recession. The same is true for
China, by the way. The Chinese yuan has been steadily growing. A strong
currency, first of all, is a sign that the country supports domestic
consumers more than foreign buyers. It seems to be the right strategy
when international trade is facing a downturn.

Being shocked, people often say and do not what they mean or should. The
same with the world’s major currencies. The US dollar has slipped down
and continues rolling down. Even a difficult epidemiological situation
in the USA doesn’t support the dollar’s value as a safe haven. Due to
the cheap liquidity provided by the Fed and low government bond yields,
the S&P 500 remains steady. Donald Trump believes that his approval
ratings grow when the US stock indexes grow. It doesn’t make much sense.
People only trust presidents when see them on banknotes. The larger is
the banknote value, the more people trust. The age of the dollar and
Trump is to end soon. It is time to replace them, isn’t it?
