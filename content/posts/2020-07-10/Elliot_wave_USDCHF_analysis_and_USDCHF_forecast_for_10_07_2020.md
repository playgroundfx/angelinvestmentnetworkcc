USD/CHF: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 10.07.2020 –
17.07.2020Alex Geuta

## [USD/CHF][1] remains likely to fall. Estimated pivot point is at the
level of 0.9530.

 **Main scenario:** consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 0.9530 with the target in 0.9170 – 0.9050.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
0.9530 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 0.9651 –
0.9781.

 **Analysis:** Supposedly, the descending third wave of larger degree
(3) continues developing on the [USD/CHF][1] [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame, with wave
1 of (3) forming inside. On the H4 time frame, wave v of 1 is forming,
wave (iii) of v finished developing inside of it. On the H1 time frame,
apparently a local correction started developing as wave (iv) of v. If
the presumption is correct, the pair will continue to decline to the
levels of 0.9170 – 0.9050. The level of 0.9530 is critical in this
scenario. Its breakout will allow the pair to continue rising to the
levels of 0.9651 – 0.9781.
