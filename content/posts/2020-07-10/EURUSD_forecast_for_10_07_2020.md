EUR/USD forecast: Dollar is grasping at strawsDmitri Demidenko

## Fundamental US dollar forecast for today

### The growth in the number of COVID-19 cases in the USA sets back the
EUR/USD uptrend

The EU governments used to be accused of inefficient management, but the
pandemic changed everything. The success of European medical services,
quick actions to provide monetary and fiscal stimulus, and Germany’s
willingness to take responsibility for poorer euro-area states have
encouraged the EUR/USD bulls to go ahead. The euro risk reversals are
growing as the epidemiological situation in the USA, unlike that in the
euro area, is deteriorating, and the local rises of the US dollar are
used to sell the greenback off. According to Bloomberg’s option
probability calculator, based on the [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) market pricing, the
[EUR/USD][1] is more likely to trade above 1.15 in a week’s time than to
drop below 1.12.

### Dynamics the ratio of U.S. versus Germany COVID-19 cases and the
euro risk reversals

The median gauge of the Wall Street 11 biggest banks also suggest the
eurodollar should be at 1.15 by the end of 2020. BofA Merrill Lynch
suggests the most bearish forecast, saying the [EUR/USD][1] should be
down to 1.05. They say the Fed will hardly boost its balance sheet
significantly, while the ECB will continue easing its monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).
According to 64% of Bloomberg experts, Christine Lagarde and her
colleagues will boost the ECB’s QE program by €400-€600 billion by the
end of the year. However, I believe it is not very wise to bet solely on
the divergence in views from [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers in the U.S. and EU. Markets
are likely to be more influenced by the trade wars or the COVID-19 [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/),
than the decisions on monetary policies.

Investors should take into account different factors and build their own
[trading strategies](https://www.fintechee.com/forex-trading-strategies/) based on the strongest drivers. In 2018-2019, the
determining forex pricing factor was the US-China trade war, in 2020, it
is the coronavirus pandemic and economic lockdowns. With this regard, a
better epidemiological situation in Europe suggests a quicker rebound of
the euro-area economy, which should support the growing demand for
European assets. The liquidity is flowing out of the US, and so, the
greenback is weakening.

One shouldn’t be confused by the growth of Citigroup's US Economic
Surprise Index. The US positive economic data under current conditions
are like fast food. It looks appealing but it is bad for your health.

The euro is also supported by the yuan that is growing in value now. The
matter is not only in the market important for the Eurozone. When
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are willing to buy anything but for the US assets, the
greenback's rivals are growing in price.

### Dynamics of euro and yuan

The drop of the USD/CNY has resulted from both a quick recovery of the
Chinese economy and the weakness of the world’s major currencies weighed
on by the huge fiscal stimulus. The yuan positively responds to the
growth of the approval ratings of democratic presidential candidate Joe
Biden, whose [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) is likely to be less aggressive than that of Donald
Trump.

Of course, one should not fully give up on the US dollar as a safe haven
amid the growth in the number of coronavirus cases in the USA. However,
the middle-term and long-term outlook of the greenback is bearish.
Therefore, one should use the drop of the [EUR/USD][1] to the bottom of
the trading range of 1.11-1.14, I suggested [earlier][4], to add to the
long positions.
