Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 18.01.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

All three cryptocurrency pairs are forming the final, fifth waves of the
bullish trends.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

The hourly BTCUSD chart displays the structure of the impulse wave
1-2-3-4-5. The market must have completed the sideways corrective wave 4
as a flat [a]-[b]-[c], where the sub-waves [a] and [b] are zigzags, and
the sub-wave [c] is an impulse. Therefore, the [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) price should be
rising in wave 5 to a level of 50000.00. According to the Elliot wave
rules, wave 5 could complete an impulse or an ending diagonal.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 35172.50 TP 50000.00

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

There is forming an upward impulse wave composed of the sub-waves
(1)-(2)-(3)-(4)-(5). The market is forming the first sub-wave of the
pattern, wave (1), as a five-wave impulse. The market could have
completed the flat corrective wave 4 as a contracting triangle. The
price should be rising in the final wave 5 to a level of 0.380, marked
by the corrective wave 4.

### Trading plan for **[XRPUSD][2]** today:

## Elliott wave Ethereum analysis

The ETHUSD market is also forming the upward impulse wave. The hourly
timeframe displays the final part of this wave. There is developing the
sub-wave (5) as an impulse. The bearish correction 4 finished, and the
price is rising in wave 5. Wave 5 is an impulse; 4 out of 5 legs must
have completed withing wave 5. Therefore, the price should be growing in
the final sub-wave [5] of 5 to a level of 1450.00.
