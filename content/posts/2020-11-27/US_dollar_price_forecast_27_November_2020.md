Dollar should build a hedge. Forecast as of 27.11.2020Dmitri Demidenko

The greenback could further weaken if foreign [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s hedge against
currency risks of the investments into the US securities. Let us discuss
the Forex outlook and make up a [EURUSD][1] trading plan.

##  **Quarterly US dollar fundamental forecast**

On Thanksgiving day, when the US securities markets do not work, it is
time to take a break and think about the future trading plan. The
fundamental analysis theory reads that the exchange rate of a currency
is determined by investment and trading capital flows, influenced by
interest rates, economic growth, inflation, and other factors. With this
regard, the growing USD shorts look natural. Investors look for more
promising assets. The growing appeal of the assets outside the United
States will facilitate the flow of capital from North America to other
continents and weaken the greenback.

The process is already going on. The USD has been more than 10% down
from the March highs and reached its two-year low amid the Fed’s
aggressive monetary expansion and easing political tensions in the USA.
Furthermore, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s believe in the improvement of the US-China trade
relations under Joe Biden; they also hope the vaccines will support the
global economic recovery. The dollar should continue weakening in 2021
amid the capital outflows from the USA and hedging against currency
risks.

Goldman Sachs predicts that the greenback will weaken by 6% over the
next 12 months, as the US stocks are fundamentally overvalued, the bond
market rates do not rise with inflation, and the global economic
recovery will encourage [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s to search for better investment
[options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) outside the United States. Citi emphasizes that foreign
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s have accumulated a huge stock of the US Treasuries. At the
same time, bearish outlooks for the dollar and lower hedging costs will
push them to hedge against currency risks by selling the USD. As a
result, the USD index will fall by 20% in 2021, which is the most
aggressive bearish forecast for the greenback.

I agree with the idea that the countries most suffered from the COVID-19
pandemic will start recovering fast due to vaccines, and their
currencies will be strengthening. Nonetheless, I have a few questions.
First, does it make sense to bet on the emerging markets’ assets, which
will be the last to receive vaccines? Second, what if the vaccines won’t
help? Unlike Pfizer and Moderna, AstraZeneca is not willing to register
its vaccine now, suggesting the further tests are necessary.

I would not like to think about negative scenarios. Moreover, people
deserve to forget 2020 quickly. They have made tremendous sacrifices and
hopefully rethought the need to appreciate what they have. I believe, at
the initial stage of vaccine introduction, we could consider buying
European and Japanese stocks, which in November looked better than their
US counterparts.

###  **Quarterly[EURUSD][1] trading plan**

In my opinion, the current situation suggests the [EURUSD][1] should be
consolidating in the medium-term range of 1.18-1.22, followed by a
breakthrough of its upper limit as vaccines are introduced, and the
world economy recovers.

I recommend buying the euro on the corrections.
