Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 27.11.2020Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I suggest entry signals
to trade each cryptocurrency.

The three major cryptocurrency pairs must have completed the uptrends.
There are forming new downtrends.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

 ****

As the price started falling sharply, the previous layout is not
relevant. The impulse wave C must have ended, and the beginning of the
new downtrend is currently unfolding. There is forming the down impulse
wave A. Therefore, the market should run down in wave A to a level below
14999. On could open short positions under the current situation.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Sell 17149.50. TP 14999.15

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

The upward linking wave [X] has completed as a double zigzag. There is
now forming the impulse wave [A], which is composed of the sub-waves
1-2-3-4-5. The price could rise a little in the final leg of correction
4. Next, the Ripple price will continue declining in wave 5, as it is
outlined in the chart. The entire [A] impulse should end at a level of
around 0.375. It is relevant to enter short trades under the current
situation.

### Trading plan for **[XRPUSD][2]** today:

Sell 0.544, TP 0.373

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

 ****

Like other major cryptocurrency pairs, the ETHUSD market has finished
the uptrend. The price is running down in the new downtrend. There is
likely to be forming the bearish impulse A that is composed of five sub-
waves. The first four legs of the A impulse have completed, and there
forming sub-wave [5]. The Ethereum price should be declining to a level
of 439.21, which is marked by wave (4).

### Trading plan for  **[ETHUSD][3] **today:

Sell 519.79, TP 439.21
