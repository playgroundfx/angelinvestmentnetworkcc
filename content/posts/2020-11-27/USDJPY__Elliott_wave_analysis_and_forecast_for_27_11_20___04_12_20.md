USDJPY: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 27.11.20 - 04.12.20Alex
Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 105.66 with a target of 102.50 – 101.11.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
105.66 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 106.39 –
107.36.

 **Analysis:** Daily time frame: presumably, a correction of larger
degree is completed in the form of wave (B). Wave (С) started to form,
with the third wave 3 of (C) developing inside. H4 time frame: wave (i)
of iii of 3 formed and an ascending correction is completed in the form
of wave (ii) of iii of 3. Apparently, wave (iii) of iii continues
forming now on the H1 time frame, with the third wave of smaller degree
iii of (iii) presumably developing inside. If the presumption is
correct, the pair will continue to drop to the levels of 102.50 –
101.11. The level of 105.66 is critical in this scenario as the breakout
will enable the pair to continue growing to the levels of 106.39 –
107.36.
