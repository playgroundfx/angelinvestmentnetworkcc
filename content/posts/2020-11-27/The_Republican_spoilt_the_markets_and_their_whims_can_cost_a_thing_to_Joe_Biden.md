The Republican spoilt the markets and their whims can cost a thing to
Joe Biden

## How will [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s live without Donald Trump's Twitter?

> \- May I count on your silence?

> \- Hardly ever. But you can rely on my talks.

Donald Trump's connection with financial markets became so stable that
Joe Biden will have to think well about [how to](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-trading-how-to/) destroy it. Investors got
used to reacting to the US 45th president's talks and took his Twitter
as something more important than an economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) or Bloomberg's
[news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/). Trump's appeals to Saudi Arabia and Russia help to end the trading
war between those two countries. Trump's mood swings indicated an
escalation or a de-escalation of the trade conflict between Washington
and Beijing. His talks contrasted with the predecessors' silence, and
now the market is losing its favourite toy.

All that starts well ends badly. And what starts badly ends even worse.
The [S&P 500][1]'s 7.7% rally following the three post-election weeks
has become one of the best in the past 90 years. It means financial
markets like Biden. That's not the problem, though. The problem is,
financial markets can make the Democrat behave in a way he doesn't like.
Whatever the occasion, Trump would encourage the US stock indexes, and
they became so spoilt that they got out of touch with reality. Such
discrepancies between markets and the real economy are a rare thing.

> \- Yes, there is. It's us, Christine.

Spoilt children often play up and make their parents satisfy their
whims. Financial markets were doing the same. At the end of 2018, they
didn't appreciate Powell's statement that the federal funds rate was far
from neutral because it implied that monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)'s normalization
could continue. The [S&P 500][1] collapsed, Donald Trump raged at
Powell, and the Fed had to correct its rhetoric. So, anyone can fall
victim to the market's anger.

The US stock indexes' whims affected Europe's marketplace too. At one of
her first press conferences as the ECB's President, Christine Lagarde
said the ECB wasn’t responsible for controlling bond yield spreads. Then
she had to apologize shortly afterwards as the bond market's reaction
was too severe.

Donald Trump's excessive love turned the market into a spoilt child, and
it would be hard to reform that. Although it's not Joe Biden's immediate
task, he will have to make an effort not to follow [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s' mood.

The Republican didn't manage to make America great again and now has to
return to his "ordinary billionaire" status, but he left his mark in
[history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) for sure. True, the financial markets love his substitute, but
all that starts well not always ends well. Let's wait and see.
