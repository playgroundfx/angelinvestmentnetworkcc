USDCAD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 27.11.20 – 04.12.20Alex
Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 1.3114 with a target of 1.2800 – 1.2650.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
1.3114 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 1.3301 –
1.3384.

 **Analysis:** Daily time frame: wave (С) of 4 of larger degree
continues developing, with the first wave 1 of (C) formed inside.
Presumably, a local correction is completed as wave 2 of (C) on the H4
time frame. Apparently, the third wave 3 of (C) is forming on the H1
time frame. Inside it, there is the first wave of smaller degree i of 3
formed, an ascending correction developed as wave ii of 3, and there is
the third wave iii of 3 developing. If the presumption is correct, the
pair will continue to drop to the levels of 1.2800 – 1.2650. The level
of 1.3114 is critical in this scenario, as the breakout will enable the
pair to continue rising to the levels of 1.3301 – 1.3384.
