EURUSD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 27.11.20 – 04.12.20Alex
Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions from corrections above the
level of 1.1802 with a target of 1.2100 – 1.2200.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
1.1802 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of 1.1715
– 1.1596.

 **Analysis:** Daily time frame: presumably, the first wave of larger
degree 1 of (3) continues developing, with wave iii of 1 formed inside.
On the H4 time frame, a local correction formed as the fourth wave iv of
1, and wave v of 1 is forming. Apparently, the corrective wave (ii) of v
finished developing and wave (iii) of v is forming on the H1 time frame.
If the presumption is correct, the pair will continue to rise to the
levels 1.2100 – 1.2200. The level of 1.1802 is critical in this
scenario. Its breakout will allow the pair to continue falling to the
levels of 1.1715 – 1.1596.
