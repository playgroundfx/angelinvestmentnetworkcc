USDCHF: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 27.11.20 - 04.12.20Alex
Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions above the level of 0.8978
with a target of 0.9296 – 0.9468.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
0.8978 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of 0.8900
– 0.8800.

 **Analysis:** Daily time frame: presumably, the descending first wave
of larger degree (1) of 5 formed and an ascending correction is now
developing as wave (2) of 5. H4 time frame: wave A of (2) formed and
wave B of (2) finished developing. Apparently, wave С of (2) is
developing on the H1 time frame, with the first wave of smaller degree i
of C formed and a local correction nearing completion as wave ii of C
inside. If this assumption is correct, the pair will continue to rise to
0.9296 – 0.9468 in wave iii of C after the correction. The level of
0.8978 is critical in this scenario. Its breakout will allow the pair to
continue falling to the levels of 0.8900 – 0.8800.
