GBPUSD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 27.11.20 – 04.12.20Alex
Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions from corrections above the
level of 1.3195 with a target of 1.3500 – 1.3700.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
1.3195 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of 1.2910
– 1.2679.

 **Analysis:** Daily time frame: presumably, the first wave of larger
degree (1) continues developing, with wave 3 of (3) formed inside. On
the H4 time frame, a descending correction appears to have developed as
the fourth wave 4 of (3), and wave 5 of (3) started forming. Apparently,
the third wave iii of 5 is developing on the H1 time frame, with wave
(v) of iii forming inside. If the presumption is correct, the pair will
continue to rise to the levels of 1.3500 – 1.3700. The level of 1.3195
is critical in this scenario as its breakout will enable the pair to
continue declining to the levels of 1.2910 – 1.2679.
