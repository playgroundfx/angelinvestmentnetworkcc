Medium-term forecast for oil, gold, and EURUSD 27.11.2020Alex Rodionov

I welcome my colleagues! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest trading
signals for traders who trade in medium-term trends.

This week, the EURUSD has continued rising and broken through the high
of November. The bulls are trying to consolidate above level 1.1920.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for next week: USCrude analysis

The oil price has reached and broken through the strong resistance
Target Zone 2 [44.22 - 43.71]. The next target in the middle-term
uptrend is Target Zone 3 [49.32 – 48.81].

Next week, I recommend expecting a correction to the support levels. The
first support level, according to technical analysis, is [43.00 –
42.81]. The second level is the trend key support [41.32 – 40.85].

It will be relevant to buy when there is a pattern. Do not forget to set
the first take-profit at the high.

### [USCrude ][1]Trading tips for the upcoming week:

  1. Buy according to the pattern in the zone of [43.00 - 42.81]. TakeProfit: 46.00, Target Zone 3 [49.32 - 48.81]. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. Buy according to the pattern in Target Zone [41.32 - 40.85]. TakeProfit: 46.00, Target Zone 3 [49.32 - 48.81]. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Gold price forecast for next week: XAUUSD analysis

The gold middle-term downtrend continues. The price has broken out
Target Zone 2 [1829.4 – 1820.1]. The trading idea to buy in the
correction didn’t work out.

The next downside target is Target Zone 3 [1736.4 – 1727.1]. This is the
target for medium-term sell positions. The traders should first
accumulate positions on the correction before the downtrend continues.

Next week, I recommend considering purchases according to the pattern in
the correction up. It is better to detail the entry point in the H1
timeframe.

The price should test the resistance zones following the correction. The
next resistance zones for the gold trend are [1861.0 - 1850.4] and
Target Zone [1926.8 – 1915.3]. After the price tests these zones, we
should start selling gold.

### [XAUUSD][2] Trading tips for the upcoming week:

  1. Buy in the correction according to the pattern after the price breaks out the level of 1818.5. TakeProfit: [1861.0 - 1850.4]. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. Sell according to the pattern in zone of [1861.0 - 1850.4]. TakeProfit: 1801.5, Target Zone 3 [1736.4 - 1727.1]. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.
