Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 17.03.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

Gold bears are desperately fighting back and do not let the price break
out the resistance - the trend border 1731.8 - 1726.8.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

Yesterday, oil traders worked out a corrective sell pattern, updated
March 15 low, and tested the short-term uptrend key support 64.16 -
63.93.

The test of the key support led to a price rise. Now prices are
approaching resistance level 65.44. This is the key level. If it is
broken out, a buy pattern will appear, and the growth target will be the
level of 66.33 (March 15 high).

Holding the resistance will allow considering oil sale in the correction
with the target at support level 64.18. A breakout of support will lead
to the reversal of the short-term uptrend.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

Sell according to the pattern in the level of 65.44. TakeProfit: 64.18.
StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

Gold bears desperately fight back and do not let the price break out the
resistance - the trend border 1731.8 - 1726.8. However, the bears'
strength is gradually running out. Now the price is as close as possible
to the resistance 1738. If the level is broken out, then the short-term
trend will reverse up.

A return of the price under the resistance of 1731 - 1726, on the
contrary, will give traders hope for a test of the support levels 1700,
1690, and a possible further price fall.

Today, it is better to wait for the outcome of the situation. At 20:30
(UTC+02:00), there will be a press conference by Fed Chairman Jerome
Powell, which should clarify the situation with gold.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

Watch the market.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

The border of the EURUSD short-term uptrend has been held. This is the
zone of ​​1.1917 - 1.1892. Even though the price went far beyond outside
the Intermediary Zone, the US trading session closed inside. Buying
priority remains.

For purchases, the price must be consolidated above the resistance level
1.1917. In this case, a false breakout pattern will allow entering
purchases with the target at levels 1.1960, 1.1990.

To sell the euro and reverse the trend, wait for the price to fix below
the support level 1.1892. In this case, the target for short trades will
be the lower Target Zone 1.1830 - 1.1814.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

Open buy positions according to the pattern in 1.1917 - 1.1892.
TakeProfit: 1.1990. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.
