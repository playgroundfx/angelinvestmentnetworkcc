Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 17.03.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

The XRPUSD must have completed forming a complex corrective wave, the
price should start declining in an impulse.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

The market continues forming a large upward impulse wave, with the first
four legs completed inside. There is developing the final, fifth wave.
In the fifth wave, there have finished the sub-waves [1] and [2], and
impulse wave [3] is still developing. There should be forming the final
sub-wave (5) of [3]. The price should go up to a level above 58116.00.
Therefore, one could enter long positions.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 55854.50, TP 58116.00

* * *

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

There must have completed the corrective wave [B], which is an element
of the bearish zigzag currently unfolding. The [B] wave is a triple
zigzag (W)-(X)-(Y)-(X)-(Z), not a triangle as it was earlier expected.
There is now forming the initial part of the impulse down wave [C].
Corrective wave (2) can have completed, so the market should be
declining in impulse (3). An approximate structure of the [C] wave is
outlined in the chart. The first target for sell trades is level 0.424,
marked by the linking wave (XX).

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] today:

Sell 0.476, TP 0.424

## Elliott wave Ethereum analysis

Since early March, the ETHUSD market has been rising in the bullish
impulse wave (5). There have completed the sub-waves 1-2-3-4 so far.
There is now forming the initial part of the final sub-wave 5, which
could conclude the entire uptrend. The price should be rising to a
level, above the previous high at 1940.00, made by the impulse sub-wave
3. One could enter buy trades in the current situation with a target
profit at 1940.00.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Buy 1762.07, TP 1940.00
