EUR/USD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 28/08/2020 –
04/09/2020Alex Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions from corrections above the
level of 1.1749 with a target of 1.2100 – 1.2200.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
1.1749 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of 1.1642
– 1.1472.

## [EUR/USD][1] remains likely to grow. Estimated pivot point is at a
level of 1.1749.

 **Analysis:** A descending correction of larger degree presumably
finished developing on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame in the form of wave (2), and
the third wave (3) started developing. On the H4 time frame, the first
counter-trend wave 1 of (3) is forming, with a local correction
presumably formed inside as the fourth wave iv of 1 Apparently, the
fifth wave v of 1 started developing on the H1 time frame.  If this
assumption is correct, the pair will continue to rise to 1.2100 –
1.2200. The level of 1.1749 is critical in this scenario. Its breakout
will allow the pair to continue falling to the levels of 1.1642 – 1.1472
in wave iv of 1.
