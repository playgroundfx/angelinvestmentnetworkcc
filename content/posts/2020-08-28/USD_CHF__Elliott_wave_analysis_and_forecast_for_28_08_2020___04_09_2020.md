USD/CHF: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 28/08/2020 –
04/09/2020Alex Geuta

 **Main scenario:** Consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 0.9161 with a target of 0.8900 – 0.8800.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
0.9161 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 0.9241 –
0.9309.

## [USD/CHF][1] remains likely to fall. Estimated pivot point is at a
level of 0.9161.

 **Analysis:** Presumably, the descending third wave of larger degree
(3) continues developing on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame, with wave 1 of (3)
forming inside. On the H4 time frame, wave v of 1 is forming, with wave
(iii) of v continuing to form inside. Apparently, the fifth wave of
smaller degree v of (iii) is developing on the H1 time frame.  If this
assumption is correct, the pair will continue to fall to  0.8900 –
0.8800. The level of 0.9161 is critical in this scenario. Its breakout
will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 0.9241 – 0.9309.
