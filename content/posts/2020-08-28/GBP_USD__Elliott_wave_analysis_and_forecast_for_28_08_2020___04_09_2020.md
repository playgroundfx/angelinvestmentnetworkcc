GBP/USD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 28/08/2020 –
04/09/2020Alex Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions from corrections above the
level of 1.3050 with a target of 1.3400 – 1.3515.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
1.3050 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of 1.2879
– 1.2755.

## [GBP/USD][1] remains likely to grow. Estimated pivot point is at a
level of 1.3050.

 **Analysis:** Presumably, the third wave of larger degree (3) continues
developing on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame, with wave 3 of (3) forming inside.
On the H4 time frame, a local correction has formed as the fourth wave
iv of 3, and wave v of 3 is forming. Apparently, the third wave of
smaller degree (iii) of v of 3 is developing on the H1 time frame.  If
this assumption is correct, the pair will continue to rise to 1.3400 –
1.3515. The level of 1.3050 is critical in this scenario as the breakout
will enable the pair to continue declining to the levels of 1.2879 –
1.2755.
