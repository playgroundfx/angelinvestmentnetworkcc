analysis Bitcoin, Ripple, Ethereum][2]**

The BTCUSD market continues forming the sideways corrective wave (4) as
a triple three composed of the sub-waves W-X-Y-X-Z. There is unfolding
the final leg of the pattern, the downward wave Z. Wave Z is developing
as a simple zigzag [a]-[b]-[c]. The sub-waves [a] and [b] have
completed, and the final impulse wave [c] is forming. The price should
continue declining towards a level of 11000.00. Next, the market should
turn up and start a new uptrend.

There is developing the sideways corrective wave [4] as a double three
composed of three sub-waves [w]-[x]-[y]. After the two sub-waves [w] and
[x] completed, the market has started declining in the final motive wave
[y] that could complete as a standard zigzag. The price is now declining
in the impulse wave (c) towards a level of 0.240. At this level, the
entire correction 4 will be 61.8% of impulse 3, according to Fibonacci
retracements.

The ETHUSD market is forming the corrective down wave [4] that is an
element of the upward impulse wave C of a larger degree, which is

zigzag (A)-(B)-(C). The price should be declining in the (C) impulse to
a level of 338.20. At this level, wave [4] will be 50% of the bullish
impulse [3], according to the Fibonacci retracements. This ratio is
highly likely to be reached.
