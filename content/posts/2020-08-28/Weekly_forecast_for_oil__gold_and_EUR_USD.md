Weekly forecast for oil, gold and EUR/USDAlex Rodionov

##  **O** **il price forecast for next wee** **k: USCrude analysis**

The oil purchases entered in the broken-out Target Zone 5 [41.67 –
40.92] last week have yielded the first profits, the local high was
broken through. The upside target in the trend is Target Zone 6 [49.17 –
48.42]. It makes sense to hold a part of buy trades at the breakeven up
to the target.

The [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) average progress of the WTI price has slowed down, so, there
shouldn’t be any strong price moves soon.

The trend key support moves to the price zone of [37.34 - 36.72]. If the
price is corrected down to this zone, we shall again enter long
positions according to the pattern. The first target will be at the
current local high.

##  **Gold** **price forecast for next wee** **k:** **XAUUSD**
**analysis** ****

Gold is trading flat now. The upper border of the sideways trend is
1958. The lower border 1913.

According to the margin zones methodology, the middle-term uptrend, as
the trend key support [1922.4 - 1913.1] is not broken out. However,
technically, the price chart looks descending.

I recommend you not try to guess the future price trend but expect the
sideways trend breakout either upside or downside to make trading
decisions.

If the accumulation zone is broken out upside, we shall buy with the
target at the high of August 18 and the upper Target Zone 2 [2044.9 –
2036.2].

If the market will go down below the sideways trend zone, we shall sell
gold, and the target will be the lower Target Zone 2 [1829.4 — 1820.1].

  2. If the price breaks out the price range of [1958 - 1913] downside, sell on the retest TakeProfit: lower Target Zone 2 [1829.4 - 1820.1]. StopLoss: above the next local high.

##  **E** **uro/dollar price forecast for next wee** **k:** **EURUSD**
**analysis** ****

The EURUSD middle-term uptrend continues. This week, the price tested
the trend key support [1.1783 – 1.1765]. After the zone test, the bulls
went ahead and retested Target Zone 4 [1.1914 - 1.1896].

Target Zone 4 is a strong resistance, which is not yet broken out. To
enter new purchases, we need to expect the price consolidation above the
zone. In this case, we shall enter new purchases on the retest, and the
target will be Target Zone 5 [1.2096 – 1.2078].

If the price doesn’t break out TZ4, the bears will try to break out the
key support zone. If so, we shall see if the zone is held or not. If it
is broken out, the trend will turn down.

###  **[EURUSD][6]  Trading tips for the upcoming week:**

retest. TakeProfit: Target Zone 5 [1.2096 - 1.2078]. StopLoss: below the
next local low.
