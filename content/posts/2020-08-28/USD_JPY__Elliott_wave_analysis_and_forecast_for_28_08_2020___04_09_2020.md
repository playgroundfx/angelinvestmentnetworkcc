USD/JPY: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 28/08/2020 –
04/09/2020Alex Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions from corrections above the
level of 105.08 with a target of 108.14 – 109.85.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
105.08 will allow the pair to continue dropping to the levels of 104.19
– 103.30.

## [USD/JPY][1] remains likely to grow. Estimated pivot point is at a
level of 105.08.

 **Analysis:** On the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame, apparently a descending
correction of larger degree finished forming as wave B and wave С
started developing, with the first wave 1 of (1) of C formed inside. On
the H4 time frame, a descending correction has formed as wave 2 of (1),
and wave 3 of (1) started to develop. Apparently, the first wave of
smaller degree i of 3 is developing on the H1 time frame, with wave
(iii) of i developing inside. If the presumption is correct, the pair
will continue to rise to the levels of 108.14 – 109.85. The level of
105.08 is critical in this scenario as the breakout will enable the pair
to continue declining to the levels of 104.19 – 103.30.
