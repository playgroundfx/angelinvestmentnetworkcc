EUR/USD forecast: Fed threw a party for the euroDmitri Demidenko

## Fundamental Euro forecast for today

### A change in the Fed’s [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) opens up new opportunities for the
EUR/USD bulls

People with strong spirits admit and correct their mistakes. The Fed is
embarking on the most dramatic shift in monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) since 2012 when
it set a 2% target on the Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) index.
The central bank announced its willingness to tolerate inflation above
this level, which means it abandoned the practice of preemptive
increases in the federal funds rate in case there are signs of severe
inflationary pressure. In fact, the Fed admitted its own mistake. If
such an approach had been used before, then monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) tightening
would have begun not in 2015, but 2018.

During the virtual conference in Jackson Hole, Jerome Powell noted that
the central bank’s [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) could not remain unchanged in a “new normal”
environment. The Fed should adapt its monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) to “the new
challenges that arise.” Low interest rates are needed for an economy
that is recovering after a recession. As for inflation, the central
bank’s acceptance of its higher values than 2% has its limits. According
to Powell, in case the inflation exceeds the 2% target, it will be
moderate and will not continue for a long time.

###  **Dynamics of US inflation**

The shift to the average PCE targeting is a bearish factor for the US
dollar. Earlier, if the US domestic data showed a positive change,
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s expected the inflation rise. The talks about the start of the
monetary normalization cycle were the reason for the USD long-term
uptrend in 2014. Now, the greenback has lost its primary benefit.
Besides, the Fed seems to limit itself in managing future recessions.

Although Jerome Powell sounded dovish, the [EUR/USD][2] rode a roller
coaster. It touched the support at 1.177-1.178, and then, tried to
consolidate above the resistance at 1.188 but failed. According to
Federated Hermes, such a wild market reaction results from the fact that
the Fed didn’t announce a boost in the QE pace to accelerate inflation.
Jefferies believes that a shift to the average PCE targeting without a
clear plan is just words ion the paper, which means nothing.

I personally believe that the bond market has once again worked out the
principle “buy on rumor, sell on facts”. Before the Jackson Hole
meeting, the Treasury yield remained low. However, it surged after
Powell’s speech, saving the greenback form a crash.

What’s next? The Fed has set the greenback back, which increases the
chance that the [EUR/USD][2] will continue rallying up after it breaks
through the local high at 1.191. Nonetheless, the Fed is an example to
follow among the world’s leading central banks, so, other regulators can
do the same. The ECB also could set a higher inflation target. For
example, the Bank of France Governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau said
that it was essential to have an inflation target over the medium term,
reacting to a major revision of the Fed’s monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). Furthermore,
Germany introduced new restrictions because of the increase in the
number of COVID-19 cases. So, not everything is so simple with the
euro’s uptrend. The euro’s surge could be followed by a drawdown, just
like a party is followed by a hangover.
