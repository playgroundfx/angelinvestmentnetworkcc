Platinum is about to take off. Forecast as of 01.12.2020Dmitri Demidenko

The deeper gold is falling, the higher platinum is rising. Investors
look for alternatives to gold, which is now rather weak. This is not the
only growth driver for the  [XPTUSD][1]. Let us discuss the precious
metals market outlook and make up a trading plan.

## Fundamental platinum price forecast for a year

For Glory is often followed by Oblivion, and not all yesterday's
brightest stars manage to shine again. Less than ten years ago, platinum
was the most expensive precious metal. However, following massive sell-
offs in 2011-2015, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s soon forgot about platinum, and the
platinum price entered the long-term consolidation range of $780-$1040
in 2016-2019. Strong demand for gold in the investment sector and
palladium in the autocatalyst industry have allowed these assets to
surpass yesterday's leader, but times are changing. And platinum should
grow in price.

By the end of November, [XPTUSD][1] rose almost 15%, while [XAUUSD][2]
dropped more than 5%. Investors are selling gold, fearing that the
situation of none years ago will repeat. At that time, the reflation
didn’t occur as had been expected, even amid massive monetary and fiscal
stimulus. [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/)s gold holdings are contracting; their buyers are looking
for an alternative and find it in platinum. What looks like the end of
the bull market for gold, for platinum, is just the beginning of a long-
term uptrend.

There is a solid foundation under the emerging bullish trend in
[XPTUSD][1]. According to the World Platinum Investment Council, demand
for platinum in 2020 will exceed supply by a record of 1.2 million
ounces. The market will be in deficit over the next several years due to
the limited platinum supply and the growing demand for its use in
hydrogen technologies. According to the CRU Group research, a  _car_
powered by a hydrogen fuel cell would require almost four times more
platinum than is currently used in a diesel car with a platinum
autocatalyst. So, it is natural that Joe Biden's pledge to spend $ 2
trillion on clean energy sent the [XPTUSD][1] up.

The euro also support the platinum uptrend. In 2019, more than half of
the autocatalyst platinum demand was from Europe and China. The stronger
is the euro, the more favorable environment is for imports. These
factors justify a close correlation between the [EURUSD][3] and
[XPTUSD][1].

### Platinum trading plan for a year

Financial markets are changing all the time. Winners become losers, and
the outsiders become the favorites. I think this is true for platinum.
The platinum bullish market is just beginning. The long-term
consolidation must have ended. So, purchases should yield quite a profit
in the future. The capitals are flowing out of the gold [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/)s to platinum
exchange-trades funds. The transition from more expensive palladium
autocatalysts to cheaper ones and, most importantly, the widespread use
of platinum in hydrogen technologies suggest the [XPTUSD][1] will be
growing in value. The primary trading idea is to buy. The medium- and
long-term targets are the levels of $1150 and $1330 per ounce.
