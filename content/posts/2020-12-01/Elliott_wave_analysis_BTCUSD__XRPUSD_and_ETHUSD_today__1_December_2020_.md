Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 01.12.2020Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I suggest entry signals
to trade each cryptocurrency.

Three major cryptocurrency pairs are following long impulse waves. There
are forming final sub-waves.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis ****

After the sideways corrective wave B completed as a contracting
triangle, the price has been sharply rising in the impulse wave C. Wave
C is about to end soon. There is developing the final impulse wave [5]
with wave C. Wave [5] should end at a level of about 20550.00.
Therefore, the BTCUSD market should be rising to this level. It is
relevant to enter long positions.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 19642.00. TP 20550.00

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

 ****

The Ripple continues forming the bullish trend. There is forming the
final wave (Y) as a simple zigzag composed of three sub-waves A-B-C.
Wave A has completed as a leading diagonal, wave B is a bearish triple
zigzag. There is unfolding a powerful impulse C with the four sub-waves
completed inside; the final wave [5] is still developing. The price is
likely to be rising to a level of 0.860. Therefore, one could enter
purchases.

### Trading plan for **[XRPUSD][2]** today:

Buy 0.650, TP 0.860

* * *

## Elliott wave Ethereum analysis

 ****

The ETHUSD market continues following the final impulse wave C, which is
an element of the bullish zigzag (Y) of a larger degree. There is
forming the final leg of the C wave, wave [5]. Wave [5] should not be
long, it could end at a level of about 665.00. It is relevant to enter
long positions with a take profit at the end of the C impulse.

### Trading plan for  **[ETHUSD][3] **today:

Buy 606.75, TP 665.00
