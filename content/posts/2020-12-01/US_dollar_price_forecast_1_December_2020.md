Dollar lost its shine: for how long? Forecast as of 01.12.2020Dmitri
Demidenko

Euphoria often gives way to Disappointment in financial markets,
especialy when the good [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) has already been price in the Forex rates.
Will this fact send down the [S&P 500][1] and [EURUSD][2]? Let us
discuss the forex outlook and make up a trading plan.

## Weekly US dollar fundamental forecast

In November, the USD was 2.6% down, increasing the loss since the
beginning of the year to 5% and hitting the lowest level since April
2018. The US dollar in November featured the worst drop since July amid
mass sell-offs of the safe-havens. The major reasons are the increase in
the global risk appetite and the easing of the political uncertainty in
the USA. The greenback has lost its shine because of the euphoria in the
US stock market, spurred by positive [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) about vaccines. The [Do][3][w
Jones][3] in November performed the best growth since January 1987
(+12%), the [S&P 500][1] performed the best since April (+11%), [Nasdaq
Composite][4] was 12% up. However, no euphoria could last forever.

The universal vaccination is a matter of time, the global economy is
recovering, the cheap money is ample. Therefore, the stock indexes are
rising. Following a tough year, positive prospects become clearer.
However, when investing, it is important not only to predict the future,
but also to assess what has already been priced in. If [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s have
considered all the positive, they expect everything to be fine. If it
turns out to be so, the market won’t have any room to grow. In the case
of US stock indices, everyone expects that everything will not be just
good, everything will be fantastic!

According to the American Association of Individual Investors, there
were 43% of bears and 26% of bulls in the market in early October. In
late November, the balance of power has dramatically shifted. 47% of
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s believe the stocks will further rise, only 27% of them are
bearish. Investors Intelligence polls show that two-thirds of [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s
share an optimistic view on the US stock market, which is the highest
number since January 2018. At that time, the euphoria was soon replaced
by the disappointment resulting in mass sell-offs.

Currently, much of the positive [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) has already been priced, and the
market ignores the negative. There are several negative factors, such as
deterioration in the US domestic data and the difficult epidemiological
situation. Furthermore, Jerome Powell warns that the next few months
will be tough, and the government hasn’t agreed on the new fiscal
stimulus package. The [S&P 500][1] can well go down in the correction,
followed by the [EURUSD][2], which is closely correlated with the stock
index. However, I don’t think the correction to be deep. History proves
that even at a time when optimism in the US stock market was high, its
decline most often led to consolidation, rather than a sharp drop.

The [EURUSD][2] bulls haven’t broken out level 1.2 amid a few negative
drivers. The US stock indexes dropped on the last day of November.
Germany’s inflation rate was down from -0.5% to -0.7% Y-o-Y, which is
the worst performance for more than a decade. This fact increases the
risk of the ECB’s monetary stimulus expansion.

### Weekly [EURUSD][2] trading plan

Euro has rebounded from the strong level of the second time. However,
the rally is now more likely to continues than in early September. It
makes sense to buy out the corrections down to $1.1905 and $1.1845. It
will be relevant to add up to the long positions when the price tests
the high of November.
