Dollar: trust and test! Forecast as of 27.04.2021Dmitri Demidenko

The Federal Reserve has become an innovator in 2020-2021, but the market
continues to live the old-fashioned way. Investors still do not believe
in the willingness of the central bank to allow the economy to overheat
and test the Fed for strength. Should we expect new tests similar to
March? Let us discuss the Forex outlook and make up a [EURUSD][1]
trading plan.

## Weekly US dollar fundamental forecast

The weak German business climate index, the dovish stance of the ECB
officials, and the hawkish shift in the forecasts of Bloomberg experts
concerning the start of tapering the US QE didn’t allow the [EURUSD][1]
bulls to consolidate the price at the bottom of figure 21. Nordea
Markets notes that the markets underestimate the possibility of a quick
return of unemployment to pre-pandemic levels, the ability of inflation
to stay above 2% for a long time, and the risks of an earlier start of
the Fed's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) normalization. If so, it's time to buy the US
dollar. If everything were so simple ...

Investors' behavior has been shaped for decades and passed down from
generation to generation. The world economy develops cyclically: the
recession is followed by the recovery and vice versa. The central bank
should give and take monetary stimulus to smooth out the recession and
prevent the following overheating. First, this leads to a weakening of
the greenback, then - to its growth. The problem with the current
recession is that it is unique. The US economy is recovering much faster
than usual. However, the return of global GDP to the trend is uneven due
to different rates of vaccination. In this regard, the Fed's position is
significantly different from what generations of [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s have seen in
previous decades. The Fed is willing to put up with the high inflation,
allowing the economy to overheat, as it considers these processes to be
temporary. Nonetheless, it is tough to change the market expectations.

Investors’ expectations stick to the old patterns. Traders tend to
overestimate the chances of a federal funds rate hike because if it
happens sooner rather than later, they could lose money on bonds. This
is especially true when borrowing costs are near [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/)ly low
levels.

As a result, there are so-called tests of the Fed’s strength. There was
an illustrative example in March. Treasury yields were rallying up even
though Jerome Powell and his colleagues persistently repeated the mantra
about the Fed’s willingness to remain passive for a long time. In April,
the Treasury yields went down, depriving the US dollar of its
competitive advantage, but the market may not have calmed down. Such
tests of strength will repeat, especially since the US economic growth
is meeting the expectations.

What am I driving at? [EURUSD][1] bulls must be ready for drawdowns. And
the corrections should be deep enough. But I strongly doubt that the
medium-term downtrend will resume. That is because the euro is not at
all the same as in the first quarter. The EU is increasing the
vaccination speed. Although not as massive as in the United States, the
euro-area fiscal stimulus is coming into effect. The stimulus effect
will be the most in 2021 and will not be distributed between years.

### Weekly [EURUSD][1] trading plan

The USA is losing its exclusivity, and other advanced economies are
recovering. Therefore, I recommend buying the [EURUSD][1] on the
rebounds from the supports at 1.2044, 1.2 and 1.1965. The signal to open
long positions will also be the euro corrections down after the
publication of the euro-area and US GDP data for the first quarter and
the FOMC meeting.
