Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 27.04.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

Bitcoin is forming a bullish zigzag. Ethereum and Ripple are developing
bullish impulses.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

The most recent BTCUSD chart section displays the initial part of the
descending impulse currently unfolding. There has completed the bearish
impulse wave 1, and the market is developing bullish correction 2.
Correction 2 should be unfolding as a simple zigzag [A]-[B]-[C]. Impulse
wave [A] looks complete, so there should be developing correction [B].
Next, the market will resume growing in the [C] impulse towards a level
of 58000.00, as it is outlined in the chart.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 53621.50, TP 58000.00

* * *

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

The descending zigzag-shaped correction [2] has completed at the most
recent XRPUSD chart section. Correction [2] is composed of three major
sub-waves, (A)-(B)-(C). There is now forming the beginning of the
bullish impulse wave [3]. The first two sub-waves (1) and (2) have
completed. Therefore, the market should be rising to a level higher than
the previous high of 1.961, marked by a large wave [1].

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] today:

Buy 1.398, TP 1.961

* * *

## Elliott wave Ethereum analysis

The hourly timeframe of the ETHUSD price chart displays the bullish
impulse 1-2-3-4-5, which should conclude the global impulse wave C. The
first four sub-waves 1, 2, 3 and 4 have completed, and the final sub-
wave 5 is still developing. Wave 5 must finish at a level of 2700.00.
Therefore, one could enter long positions with a target profit at a
level of 2700.00.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Buy 2495.54, TP 2700.00
