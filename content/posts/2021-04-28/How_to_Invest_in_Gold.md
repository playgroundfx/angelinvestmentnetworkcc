Investing in Gold in 2021Oleg Tkachenko

In August 2020, gold updated its [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) high, with investment yield
amounting to nearly 46%. The coronavirus pandemic that began in January
- February broke global economic relations: the quarantine decreased the
developed countries' consumption levels, and GDP forecasts became more
pessimistic.

Stock indexes reversed down: [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s started transferring money to
protective assets, gold being one of them. How does investing in gold
protect your investment portfolio? Why do [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s trust gold? How to
gain exposure to gold and invest in the yellow metal? Read on to find
out!

## Why is gold important?

Gold (AU) is traditionally viewed as a moderate-risk investment asset.
Unlike other assets, this precious metal will never devalue for a few
reasons:

  * It can serve as a money equivalent and a universal means of payment. 

  * Its reserves are limited, and the industrial demand never fades out.

  * The price of gold has been rising since the beginning of the '00s.

Some of the reasons for that are a switch to electronic exchange systems
and [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s’ easier online access to the markets.

How do gold markets operate?

  1. There are market participants there: gold mining and refining companies, suppliers, central banks, commercial banks, depositories, stock exchanges, traders, and [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s. Private persons, legal entities, investment and pension funds, etc., can act as traders and [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s. 

  2. You can trade physical gold or open an uncollated gold account. In the first case, it's gold bars, coins, and gold jewelry that you're trading. In the second case, you don't take physical possession of gold; instead, you own derivatives or securities linked to the price of gold. You don't physically store gold. Gold is traded in exchange and OTC markets. Gold's exchange ticker is XAU.

For more details, you can read our article ["What affects gold prices?
Exploring the Gold Market."][1]

## How is the price of gold determined?

Global gold prices are calculated in two markets:

  1. The gold spot price is calculated in London. Twice a day on business days, the London Bullion Market Association (LBMA) establishes gold quotes (London Gold Fix). The quotes of the gold market's five biggest market makers — Bank of Nova Scotia–ScotiaMocatta, Barclays Bank Plc, Deutsche Bank AG, HSBC Bank USA, NA, and Societe Generale — serve as a basis of calculation. The Fixing system considers traders' orders and sets the [XAU/USD][2]'s average price as those orders are gradually executed.

  2. Gold futures' price is calculated at NY commodity exchange — COMEX (CME Group).

## Benefits of Investing in Gold

The advantage of gold investing is that traders are interested in this
highly liquid asset at any stage of the market's fluctuation. It cannot
devalue like stocks or currencies. Inversely, gold prices rise during
hyperinflation, developed economies' crises, bankruptcies, wars, or
pandemics. In the last century, there even existed the gold standard
used for money emission.

Advantages of trading gold assets in Forex:

  * Moderate volatility and high liquidity.

  * No risk of sharp depreciation.

  * Low entry threshold.

  * Long-term profitability exceeds a bank deposit's profitability.

Another advantage of investing in gold is relatively easy price
forecasting. Gold quotes don't depend on particular economies. It's
definite fundamental factors that drive them, such as interest rates,
inflation, GDP predictions, the USD rate, etc.

## Five ways to invest in gold

There exist several ways of investing money in gold. The difference
between them is based on a few criteria:

1\. The amount of investments:

  * Small sums can be invested in [mutual fund](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-vs-mutual-fund/)s' certificates, gold bank deposits, or gold bars. Investing in gold coins, whose price will be rising simultaneously with gold quotes and numismatic value, is becoming more and more popular. You can also open an account with a Forex broker.

  * Large capital can be invested in stock markets: [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/)s, futures, gold miners' stock.

2\. Ways to invest in gold

  * Buying pure gold: bars, coins, jewelry. When investing money in gold coins, one can make additional profits from growth in their numismatic value. 

  * Making money from a difference in exchange rates: investing in securities, [mutual fund](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-vs-mutual-fund/)s, and CFDs.

Gold investment: pros and cons. How to invest in gold? Let's find it
out.

### 1\. Owning physical gold

Buying physical gold offers you direct exposure to gold. That means you
buy it for real, and then you can use it at your discretion: keep it at
home, in a bank's safe deposit box, or use a safe storage option.

Benefits of investing in gold bars and physical metal:

  * Psychological effect. Gold bullion seems to be a more reliable gold investment option compared to account figures.

  * Usability. Using things and personal ornaments made of gold is a part of everyday luxury. What's more, you can always trade your gold objects in or cover a part of their cost by pawning them at the price of scrap gold.

Cons:

  * Some banks can impose additional requirements on non-residents if they wish to buy pure gold. 

  * Storage. You can store your gold in a bank, but what if the bank goes bankrupt? You can take it back only if you've been storing it in a safe deposit box. Keeping your gold at home can be risky too. First, you need to be sure that no one will steal your bars. Second, the yellow metal requires permanent care and special storage conditions to avoid oxidation. 

  * Liquidity. You cannot sell physical gold in a few clicks without leaving your home, like securities. 

  * Mobility. Transportation of physical gold outside the country is regulated by law, and the owner isn't often the one who benefits from that.

  * Selling gold. Gold bullion can be easily sold back to the bank that sold it. Other buyers may demand an examination. Some countries impose VAT when gold is sold. Total expenses may go up to 20-25% of the metal's value. 

### 2\. Gold certificates

In the USA, a "gold certificate" was a security issued by the US
treasury until 1934. It used to prove the ownership of gold deposited
with a bank. Nowadays, a "gold certificate" means an agreement between a
lender and a borrower, under which the borrower (issuer) is obliged to
pay back the borrowed money. The amount will depend on the rate of gold.
A certificate owner does not own real gold or have the right to physical
delivery and isn't secured against the issuer's bankruptcy.

A gold certificate can be compared to a bank deposit. Investors put a
money equivalent into their bank gold accounts but do not buy the actual
gold. Instead, they get the right to have the money returned with
interest at a price valid upon the predetermined period's expiration.
Disadvantages of gold deposits:

  * High bank margin — around 8-10%;
  * Risk of losing your deposit: the Deposit Insurance Fund does not secure
  * gold deposits in case of bank bankruptcy in some countries.

### 3\. Buying gold [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/)s and [mutual fund](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-vs-mutual-fund/)s

An [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) purchases shares of [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/)s that make investments in the global
market's gold assets. SPDR Gold Trust is an example of such funds.
That's the world's largest investment fund whose assets are 100% backed
by its own gold.

An alternative to [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/)s would be investing in [mutual fund](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-vs-mutual-fund/)s. Investors
have to [contact](https://www.playgroundfx.com/contact/) an asset management company and entrust their money to
that company. Then they receive a certificate that grants them the right
to have a deposit with interest income.

Pros:

Cons:

  * Entry threshold. To buy gold [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/) stocks, one needs to have access to a stock exchange, hence exchange, brokers’ and management fees. An [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) must qualify as a "qualified [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)."

  * Liquidity. In most cases, investing in [mutual fund](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-vs-mutual-fund/)s does not allow one to withdraw money earlier without paying early withdrawal fees. Also, an [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) can lose both profits and capital if a [mutual fund](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-vs-mutual-fund/) has turned out loss-making by the certificate expiry date.

  * Bankruptcy risk

### 4\. Gold CFD trading

A CFD stands for "contract for difference." It's an agreement between
two parties to pay the difference between the quotes effective on the
agreement's commencement and termination dates. Technically, it looks
like the following: a trader from wherever in the world opens an account
with a broker, has himself/herself verified, tops up the account, and
opens trades to sell or buy assets. The broker earns a commission. CFDs
are tied to XAU quotes. Just like in the case of certificates, the
trader doesn't own real gold.

Pros:

  * Low entry threshold. For example, the [XAU/USD][2]'s contract [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) at LiteForex specify that the minimum trade volume is 0.01 lots, the margin size is 1%, and leverage is 1:100. One lot size is 100 units.

If the XAUUSD costs 1,730 USD, to buy the minimum volume of 0.01 lots,
you will need as little as 17.30 USD (1,730*100*0.01*0.01), which is
less than the minimum deposit of 50 USD.

  * Lowest fees. There aren't any stock exchange fees. There are only spreads, swaps, and a small fee per each lot traded in an ECN-account.

  * The opportunity of opening a short position. With a Forex broker, you can earn from investing in CFDs on XAU even if the price falls.

  *  1:100 Leverage. Stock brokers’ leverage does not usually exceed 1:10.

  * You do not have to be a "qualified [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)."

Cons:

  * Low volatility makes this type of gold investment inappropriate to scalping and short-term strategies.

  * As you have to use bigger leverage and increase trade volumes, this kind of gold investment is associated with bigger risks compared to currency pairs.

You can open trades in the XAU/USD free and without registration right
now! Click on "For [beginners](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-for-beginners/)" - "Open a demo account" in the menu bar on
top of LiteForex's site. Then click on "Trade" and choose the XAUUSD in
the "Metals" tab in the left menu.

### 5\. Gold futures and [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) trading

Gold futures and [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) trading is similar to CFD gold trading: a
trader opens an account with a broker, has himself/herself verified
through QUIK, Thinkorswim, or any other platform of that kind, and sends
a broker orders to open trades. The difference is that the trader
becomes the real owner of securities registered by a depositary. Gold
can be delivered only under the [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of commodity futures contracts,
but non-deliverable futures are even more interesting to private
traders.

Pros:

Cons:

  * High entry threshold. To buy the minimum lot and pay commissions, at least 1,000 USD is required. Non-U.S. citizens will need a sub-broker authorized to work with US brokers to trade gold in the US stock markets.

  * Complexity. Futures and [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) are derivative financial instruments. Their [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of use are more complicated than those of CFDs or exchange-traded funds, so traders should understand the specifications well.

  * Limited choice of securities if one is not a "qualified [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)."

## How to manage risks when trading gold?

There are several ways to cut risks:

  * Diversification. Investing in such assets inversely [correlated][3] to gold as stocks, indexes, treasury bonds, deposits. The Gold price's fall is covered by stock assets' growth. Conversely, stock assets' fall will be partially covered by growth in the [XAU/USD][2]'s quotes.

  * Periodic portfolio rebalancing. For example, reducing loss-making assets' share in favor of more profitable assets.

  * Fundamental factors control: macroeconomic statistics, currency rates, stock markets' quotes, supply and demand in the gold market, inflation, global GDP predictions, geopolitical arena, etc. Control correlated markets too.

And the main gold investment advice for long-term traders would be the
following: don't rush to get rid of your gold investment when the price
goes down. History says that quotes' moves are wavy. That means the
yellow metal will grow to new highs after a fall.

## Gold investments Summary

Historically, gold has been subconsciously viewed as a key to financial
stability. The US dollar is just a piece of paper that people trust. It
can be printed in whatever quantities and increase the national debt.
Greece and Cyprus have already shown how "reliable" state bonds can be.
Hypothetically, if a global crisis occurs and the major currencies
hyper-inflate, they will devalue compared to gold because it's gold that
remains the world's safe-haven asset.

Who can be interested in gold investments:

  * Active [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s who want to diversify risks and balance investment portfolios

  * Conservative [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s. The precious metal is more volatile than stock assets or cryptos. Despite drawdowns, gold will always trend up in the long term, compared to currencies. Inflation explains that.

  * Investors who can afford to freeze their spare money for at least ten years.
