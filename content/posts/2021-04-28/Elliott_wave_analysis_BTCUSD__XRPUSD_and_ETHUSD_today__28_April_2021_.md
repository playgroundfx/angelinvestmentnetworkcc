Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 28.04.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

The previously suggested scenario for the cryptocurrency pairs covered
in the article is still relevant. Let us study each cryptocurrency in
detail.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

The BTCUSD market has recently completed the down wave 1 as a five-wave
impulse. Next, the price has started correction in wave 2, which is
likely to be a simple zigzag [A]-[B]-[C]. Impulse [A] and correction [B]
have completed, and the Bitcoin price should resume rising in the
impulse wave [C]. Wave 2 is likely to complete at a level of 58000.00.
Next, the price will turn down and start declining.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 54905.50, TP 58000.00

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

The most recent XRPUSD chart section displays a descending zigzag-shaped
corrective wave [2], which looks complete. Wave [2] is a zigzag
(A)-(B)-(C), where (A) wave is a leading diagonal, and correction (B) is
a contracting triangle; wave (C) is a simple impulse. There is now
developing an ascending impulse, a few small sub-waves have completed,
they are waves (1)-(2) and 1-2. The price should be rising in the third
sub-wave to a level higher than the high 1.961 marked by wave [1].

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] today:

Buy 1.395, TP 1.961

## Elliott wave Ethereum analysis

The most recent ETHUSD chart section displays the corrective wave 4
completed as a simple bearish zigzag [A]-[B]-[C], where wave [C] is an
ending diagonal. There is now unfolding the upward impulse wave 5, which
should be developing as an impulse [1]-[2]-[3]-[4]-[5]. The price should
slightly decline in correction [4]. Next, the price will resume growing
in wave [5]. The entire impulse should end at a level around 2800.00.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Buy 2632.60, TP 2800.00
