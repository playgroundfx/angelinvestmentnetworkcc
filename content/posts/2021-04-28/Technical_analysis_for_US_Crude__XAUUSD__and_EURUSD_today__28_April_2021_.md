Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 28.04.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

Oil price broke out the resistance level of 62.12. After that, the price
reached the Intermediary Zone 64.00 - 63.14.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

Oil price broke out the resistance level of 62.12. After that, the price
reached the Intermediary Zone 64.00 - 63.14. The Intermediary Zone is
the border of a short-term downtrend, therefore, it is primarily
profitable to look for sales according to the pattern at this IZ. The
target for sales will be the zone of 60.93 - 60.75. It would be
reasonable to take a part of profits at the Additional Zone 61.95 -
61.82.

An alternative scenario implies a downtrend reversal by breaking out the
Intermediary Zone. In this case, look for oil purchases with the target
at the upper Target Zone 66.20 - 65.69.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

Sell according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 64.00 - 63.14.
TakeProfit: 60.93. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

Yesterday, a recommendation to sell gold in the Additional Zone 1782 -
1781 worked out. The price reached level 1768. This level is the border
of the short-term uptrend. If it is broken out, the trend will reverse
down, so it would be reasonable to enter gold sales with a target in the
lower Target Zone 1747 - 1742.

Until level 1768 is broken out, it is profitable to look for purchases.
To do so, wait for the pattern formation, for example, “1-2-3”. In this
case, the target will be level 1796.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

Open buy positions according to the pattern in 1772 - 1768. TakeProfit:
1796. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

The price rise from the local support zone of 1.2072 - 1.2068 was
stopped in the resistance zone 1.2092. Today, yesterday's upward impulse
is being absorbed. If the bears break out level 1.2058, then it will be
possible to sell the euro with a target in the Intermediary Zone 1.2028
- 1.2020.

The EURUSD short-term uptrend border is far from the current price. The
support level of 1.2007 serves as a beforementioned border. Therefore,
when the price enters the zone of 1.2028 - 1.2007, it is profitable to
look for new purchases with a target at level 1.2113.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

  1. Sell when level 1.2058 is broken out. TakeProfit: Intermediary Zone 1.2028 - 1.2020. StopLoss: 1.2075.

  2. Buy according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 1.2028 - 1.2020. TakeProfit: 1.2113. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.
