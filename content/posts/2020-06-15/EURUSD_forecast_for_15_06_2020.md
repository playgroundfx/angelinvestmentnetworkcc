Dollar chooses the lineDmitri Demidenko

## The EUR/USD trend will depend on the epidemiological situation and
the shape of the US economy’s rebound

Is the dollar sell-off in the second quarter the beginning of the end,
or it is too early to give up on the greenback yet? What is the crash of
the US stock indexes at the end of the second week of June? IS it the
first sign of a deep drawdown? Or, is it just the reaction of the market
to the bad [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) on the epidemiological situation, whose improvement will
again encourage the S&P 500 buyers? The answers to these questions will
determine much, if not everything. Taking into account the share of the
dollar in the Forex operations and the importance of the US stock
indexes for the global economy the increased demand for the greenback
and the US stocks is natural.

 **Dynamics of the USD**

Unlike short-term traders, who are selling the dollar off, long-term
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are not willing to get rid of the greenback. There is a risk
of the second wave of COVID-19, and the US economy could be recovering
slower than it might be expected considering the S&P 500 rally. There is
also a risk of the trade wars escalation and the downgrading of credit
ratings amid the growth of the government debts. That is why [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s
hold safe havens in their portfolios. Due to the Fed’s grim forecasts,
10-year Treasury yield failed to go back to the psychologically
important value of 1%, and the greenback got stronger at the end of the
second week of June.

The White House has the opposite opinion, suggesting a V-shaped rebound
of the US economy. The US administration the Republican-controlled
Senate oppose extending the extra $600 weekly jobless payments after
July. They do not want to discourage people from going back to work. I
must note that the White House is supported by some analysts. For
example, Morgan Stanley believes the US economy should be back to the
pre-crisis levels in late 2020 already.

Investors expect a clue on the shape of the US GDP recovery. According
to Bloomberg forecasts, the US retail sales in May should be 7.9% up,
covering 40% of losses featured in April. Besides, Facteus weekly report
signals the indicator should continue growing in June. The domestic data
of China, the country that was the first to defeat COVID-19, show that
the Chinese economy is growing at a slower pace than it did before.

Financial markets now need an improved epidemiological situation and a
strong stimulus. The locomotive of the world’s economy can now become
not the US but the euro-area, where the number of new virus cases is
rapidly declining. Besides, the cheap money provided by the ECB and the
EU governments will encourage the [EUR/ USD][3] bulls. According to
Refinitiv, since mid-May, when the French-German fiscal stimulus plan
was presented, the demand for the euro [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) with strikes of 1.15-117
and 1.2 in 1-3 months and 6-12 months has sharply increased. Over the
past three weeks, the amount of call [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) has been 50% more than that
of put [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/), which signals the market bullish sentiment.

In my opinion, the [EUR/ USD][3] could continue the rally if the bulls
hold the price above the support at 1.122-1.124. If the support is
broken out downside, the price may be corrected down to 1.1155 and
1.112.
