Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 15.09.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

The market is following the planned scenario for all three
cryptocurrency pairs covered in the article. There are forming initial
parts of bearish impulses.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

The most recent section of the BTCUSD price chart displays the beginning
of the new down wave unfolding as an impulse. The down wave 1 finished,
and correction 2 completed as a triple zigzag. The Bitcoin price should
be declining in impulse wave 3 to a level below 41800.00.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Sell 46975.90, TP 41800.00

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

The XRPUSD market continues declining in the new downtrend. There must
be forming a bearish wave, with the first two sub-waves completed
inside. The third wave has just started forming. Sub-waves [1] – [2]
have finished in wave 3. The Ripple price should be moving down towards
a level of 0.950 and lower.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] **** today:

Sell 1.081, TP 0.950

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

The ETHUSD market situation is similar to that of the BTCUSD. Correction
B has completed, and the market is declining in the new down wave. The
first two sub-waves 1 and 2 have completed, and there is unfolding a
more powerful impulse wave 3. The Ethereum price should be declining to
a level below 2895.00, marked by wave 1. One could enter sell trades in
the current situation.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Sell 3386.30, TP 2895.00
