Visa Stock Forecast: Will the Company Continue to Be Stable?Jana Kane

Visa is a globally known payments giant, among Mastercard and UnionPay,
with the largest market share. Visa payments are accepted in more
countries than those of other payment companies. Everyone knows Visa
Inc. Although the company doesn't produce cards itself, credit and debit
cards worldwide have its logo.

[Visa Inc.][1] operates in an industry that is barely affected by global
shocks; people always need food and clothes, so they make payments at
least in shops. Even the coronavirus crisis couldn't affect Visa stocks.
Although its equities fell 37%, the crash was smaller than that of other
companies.

The article covers the following subjects:

The coronavirus restrictions will be lifted soon. Is it a reason for the
stocks’ further appreciation? Will the price of Visa stock go up? Let's
find out!

## Visa Inc. Stocks: a Brief Overview

Visa Inc. ([NYSE: V][2]) is a global payments technology company, one of
the major digital payments providers. Its products and services include
a transaction processing payment network VisaNet, which provides
authorization, clearing, and settlement of payment transactions, value-
added services, card products, and platforms. The company operates under
Visa, Visa Electron, Interlink, VPAY, and PLUS brands.

Here is some data on Visa’s stocks (as of May 25, 2021):

  * Market cap: $489 billion

  * Shares outstanding: 1.9 billion

  * Public float: 1.691 million

  * P/E ratio: 47.38

  * Payout ratio: 22.98% (based on this year's estimates)

  * EPS: $5.04 

  * Dividend Yield: 0.56%

  * Total return price range: 179.23 – 237.50

  * Annual dividend: $1.28

  * Forecast 12-month forward PEG Ratio: 2.2

  * Average volume: 9.02 million 

Visa Inc. was founded in 1958. Still, it became a publicly traded
company only on March 8, 2008. Visa held the largest IPO in the US.
Then, it managed to sell 406 mln shares at $44 per share and raised
$17.9 billion. The stock split was done only once in March 2015 at a
four-to-one ratio.

The corporation has two share classes. Class A shares are common stocks
traded on the NYSE. All [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s have a buyright to them. There is a
dividend increase by an average of 20.92% each year.

Ahead of the IPO, the enterprise set up special Class B stocks related
to the merchant lawsuits. Only financial institutions own Class B
shares. These equities are structured in a way so that growth in Visa's
litigation escrow account is used as a buyback of the class A shares.

The current Visa stock quote is 223.79 US dollar.

## Major Factors That Affect Visa Stock Price in 2021 & Beyond

It's not a secret that the values of companies' stocks depend on the
same set of factors. They include internal company and industry [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/),
company financial performance, strong demand and supply, global
environment, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) sentiment, etc.

In this section, we will discover the fundamental factors that may
precisely affect the V stock forecast.

### Consumer Spending

Client services, cross-border transactions, data processing, and value-
added services make up an enterprise's revenue.

The payments company is largely affected by changes in consumer spending
opportunities. The Covid-19 lockdown led to a 5% YoY fall in 2020 due to
lower cross-border volumes and a drop in payment volume and processed
transactions.

Although the lockdown has been easing, there is still no clarity. The
further opening of borders will support Visa stocks. In case of
prolonged restrictions, the shares won't be able to reach new highs.

### Fees

The largest part of Visa’s revenue comes from transaction fees when Visa
cards are used. The company charges service fees, data processing fees,
and international fees.

An increase in fees boosts Visa’s earnings and leads to a rise in share
value. In 2020, Visa and MasterCard tried to increase interchange fees
for some types of purchases made by credit cards. Interchange or swipe
fees are provided by merchants to banks that issue cards and credit card
companies for processing card transactions. However, rising pressure
from lawmakers and trade groups made the payments services postpone the
initiative until 2022.

If the company manages to increase swipe fees in 2022, the stocks’ rise
will be supported.

### Technologies

Crypto Implementation. The corporation plans to become the first
payments company to launch a major network with transactions in USD
Coin. Visa is testing the settlement with Crypto.com. Later this year,
we can expect cooperation with other companies. If the company can reach
new partnerships in the cryptocurrency industry, it will cover new
markets, and its shares will potentially surge.

AI technologies. At the beginning of 2021, the company introduced a
range of services powered by artificial intelligence for immediate and
more transparent payments. Such improvements support the share price.

## Visa Stock Forecast for 2021: Analysts’ Recommendations

The average 12-month forecast by [25 Wall Street analysts][3] is
$250.22, a 9.11% upward movement. The highest price target is set at
$280.00; the lowest possible rate is $220.00. 24 of 25 ratings are
“Buy,” with only 1 of holding.

### Ramsey El-Assal, Barclays



In a recent report, Ramsey El-Assal from Barclays boosted the stock
price target from $250.00 to $275.00. The analyst maintained the rating
at “Overweight.”

### Moshe Orenbuch, Credit Suisse

Credit Suisse, represented by Moshe Orenbuch, has the price expectation
at $280 (vs. $270 previous Visa stock outlook) with an “Outperform”
rating.

### Wells Fargo & Company

Wells Fargo & Company increased its Visa stock price prediction from
$240.00 to $265.00 without any rating.

### James Faucette, Morgan Stanley

James Faucette at Morgan Stanley raised the Visa share price forecast
from $258.00 to $279.00 with an “Overweight” rating.

### BMO Capital Markets

Analysts at BMO Capital Markets improved the Visa price target from
$230.00 to $245.00. The rating is "Outperform."



## Visa Stock Technical Analysis

To make a realistic forecast for [Visa][4]'s stock, we need to identify
the general market situation, global trends, and key levels. We'll do a
technical analysis of the monthly chart for those purposes.

As the chart above suggests, a global bullish trend has been developing
for the last five years at least. The trade volumes indicate that
trading activity had been growing until spring 2020. That means big
traders were interested in raising Visa's stock quotes. However, trade
volumes have been falling gradually for one and a half years.

Two trend development stages can be singled out there:

It's the second stage that we're observing. It will continue until a
global reversal has occurred, confirmed by a crossover of the blue trend
line.

Until then, we can only talk about a local correction, indicated by the
increase in trading activity on the ultimate completed red candlestick.
A breakout of the support level of 214 USD marked with the red line will
confirm[ Visa stock][5]'s projected fall in the near future.

### Visa Stock Forecast For Next Three Months

Let's analyze the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) chart to make a short-term forecast for three
months.

The Fibo grid laid onto [Visa][5]'s prediction chart will help us divide
the global trend into a few stages. I’ve singled out three of them:

  * 1 — the trend start area located between 0 and 0.236. Approaching that area points to a high risk of the trend's ending. The chart shows that area supported the buyer many times during the whole trend development period.

  * 2 and 3 — the red and the blue price consolidation areas located between 0.236 and 1.618 Fibonacci levels from the trend's bottom. 0.786 Fibo projection lies between those two areas and creates powerful support for the bulls.

Visa's price chart has retraced from the third area's upper limit. The
red support level of 215 US dollars will help us assess the potential of
bearish momentum.

The second consolidation area's limit and a strong psychological level
lie farther down, at around 205 USD and 200 USD, respectively.

On the one hand, those powerful support levels located so close suggest
the bears can't break through them; on the other hand, they might
continue pressing the price if the buyers' reaction to approaching those
levels is weak.

In the latter case, a correction target will be around 175 USD, the
second area's lower limit. A long-term ascending trend line lies there
as well, and it will support the buyer. A further downward movement
looks unlikely.

The indicator analysis will help us obtain some additional signals.

The [MACD][6] chart crossed the zero line last month and continues
dropping. It almost reached this year's minimum marked with the red line
on the indicator's MAs. Crossing that level from above will suggest a
high probability of the Visa to USD's further decline.

The current slowdown of the indicator's lines lets us presume that the
stock is oversold locally. So, we may also suppose that the market will
switch to a short-term bullish correction. At the same time, a bullish
price movement is limited by the local uptrend's line that started in
spring 2020 (marked with the blue dotted line). That level will prevent
the Visa value from recovering. The Visa stock's price will likely
retrace to 215 USD in the coming months once the level is retested from
below.

### Long-Term Visa Analysis for 2021/2022

Let's do a technical analysis of the VISA price [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) and make a
prediction for the nearest 12 months.

I plotted monthly price projections on the price prediction chart above
using [Bollinger bands][7].

A crossover of the local trend line and other signals mentioned above
point to a slowdown of the price rise and an eventual consolidation at
the minimum.

VISA's future value won't likely drop below 200 US dollars by the
beginning of 2022.

The Visa stock's bearish potential will determine further developments.
The consolidation is likely to continue near the third area's lower
limits, at around 200 USD. The market won't be flat forever.

The bulls have every chance to update Visa's all-time high as early as
the end of 2022 if they manage to consolidate at 200 USD. Their failure
to do that won't be a disaster either since they have a good opportunity
to buy Visa shares at a discount, at 175 USD. The price is unlikely to
drop below that level.

Check the table below for the [Visa stock][5]'s expected trading ranges
for each month.

#### Visa Long-Term Trading Plan

Let's make a trading plan for Visa based on Visa stock's projected price
fluctuations. The main objective will be trading within the third area's
channel and exploiting the stock's volatility.

Given the corrective sentiment, the nearest level for opening a trade is
at around 215 USD, the blue line.

Place Stop Loss at a safe distance, below 200 USD.

A projected price target will be the consolidation area's upper limit at
around 235 - 240 USD.

If we're lucky, we will conduct two or three trades while a flat trend
unfolds. I don't recommend opening short trades as the main trend
remains bullish, and the market can easily trigger short position stops.

Don't play against the trend and follow your own risk management rules!

## Visa Stock Forecast for 2022

How much can Visa stock grow? Visa shares aren't subject to significant
price movements. According to Wallet Investor’s price projection, the
company will be able to reach a new all-time high of $273 by the end of
the year. The source expects a solid uptrend. Beginning 2022 near $242,
the stocks will move up towards $273 by the end of the year.

If you check rate fluctuations month by month, you will notice that the
difference between the minimum and maximum values is narrow. It signals
the stability of the company and attractive opportunities for long-term
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s.

If the company succeeds in raising swipe fees, its earnings will move
up. Thus, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s can expect future growth in shares, so the Visa
stock projection will be proven.

## Long-Term Visa Stock Forecast for 2025 and Beyond

Analysts of Wallet Investor believe the bullish trend will prevail at
least until the middle of 2026. As the company owns a large share of the
payments market, the downtrend can occur if only another global shock
like Covid-19 happens. The future price of Visa shares can reach 368.111
by December 2025.

## A Retrospective Look at Visa's Price History

Historical accuracy is vital when defining the projected growth rate. If
you look at the whole chart (beginning in 2008), you will notice that
[Visa stocks][2] don't suffer significant price volatility. The share
price is stable, which makes Visa shares a favorable long-term
investment. Let's look at the most crucial price fluctuations.

The first noticeable price drop happened in December 2018, when the
Nasdaq, Dow Jones, and S&P 500 survived the worst month since 2009. The
stock market reacted to the US-China trade war, the risks of a
government shutdown, the falling global economic growth, and worries
about the Fed's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). Visa shares were trading below $122 on
December 24, the lowest level in 7 months. However, it became a starting
point for the following uptrend.

2019 was quite stable for the company. Shares set new highs despite some
declines. On February 19, 2020, the price was at $214, the threshold the
company reached next time only in August 2020.

Why was [Visa stock][9] down? We all know what happened to the world in
February 2020 - the coronavirus. Visa shares weren’t an exclusion during
the global stock crash. The price plunged from $212.25 to $135.74. March
23 became a turning point for the price - a sharp bearish trend was
replaced by an upward movement, which was in force until September 2020.

The following decline wasn't as dramatic as in February and March, but
it pulled the share rate below $200 again. Wall Street sell-off and the
announcement that the company planned to [acquire the fintech startup
YellowPepper][10] pulled the price down.

The price started recovering on October 28 when the corporation reported
its fourth-quarter financial results. The report highlighted a quarterly
revenue fall, cross-border transaction volume's decrease, and fiscal
earnings decline. However, the number of processed transactions rose by
2 percent, and the adjusted earnings per share were better than expected
($1.12 vs. $1.09). Overall, Visa Inc. performed better than anticipated
between July and September. As a result, stocks jumped by 3.2 percent.

The financial outlook highly impacts Visa shares. According to the
fiscal year 2021 earnings report for Q1, net revenue growth dropped by
6% YoY, while net income declined by 4% YoY. As a result, the shares
moved down.

## Is It Good to Invest in Visa (V)?

Visa's future is promising. Visa shares are a good long-term investment.
If you are an intraday trader, the lack of significant price
fluctuations can be a disadvantage. However, if you want to invest in a
stable asset, invest in Visa shares as the buy or sell question won’t
arise.

Stock trading is a challenging activity. A lack of volatility is not a
guarantee of profitable trades. We recommend you practice on a demo

great way to train. A wide range of instruments and technical
indicators, along with real market conditions, will allow you to gain
expertise.
