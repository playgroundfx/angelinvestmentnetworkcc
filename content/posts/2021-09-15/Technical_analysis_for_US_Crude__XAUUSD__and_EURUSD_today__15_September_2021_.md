Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 15.09.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

Oil continues to strengthen within a short-term uptrend.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

Oil continues to strengthen within a short-term uptrend. Now traders are
trying to update yesterday's high. In case of a price consolidation
above the beforementioned high level, the next growth target will be
Target Zone 2 72.85 - 72.32.

Levels 69.93 - 69.57 and 68.42 - 68.17 serve as strong supports. When
updating yesterday's high, the support zones should be rearranged.

Today, it is reasonable for traders to hold purchases, take a part of
the profit at level 70.90 and move trades to the breakeven. Look for new
purchases on the correction.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

Hold up purchases. TakeProfit: 70.90, Target Zone 2 72.85 - 72.32.
StopLoss: at the breakeven.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

Despite all the efforts, gold buyers were unable to break out the trend
key resistance at 1803 and consolidate the price higher. Now the price
is returning under resistance, which indicates that traders should look
for gold sales. Wait for a pattern, for example, 1-2-3, to enter sales.

Price consolidation above yesterday's high is required for purchases. In
this case, the short-term trend will reverse up, and the growth target
will be the upper Target Zone 1826 - 1821.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

Sell according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 1803 - 1801.
TakeProfit: 1784. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

The chances of the euro declining within the short-term downtrend are
very high. Level 1.1774 and the Target Zone 1.1733 - 1.1715 serve as the
targets of the trend. The task of traders is to hold sales entered in
the zone of 1.1867 - 1.1858.

An alternative scenario suggests growth during the day and a breakout of
the Intermediary Zone 1.1867 - 1.1858. In this case, the trend will
reverse up, and the target for purchases will be the upper Target Zone
1.1963 - 1.1946.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

Hold down sales entered in the zone of 1.1867 - 1.1858. TakeProfit:
1.1774, Target Zone 1.1733 - 1.1715. StopLoss: at the breakeven.
