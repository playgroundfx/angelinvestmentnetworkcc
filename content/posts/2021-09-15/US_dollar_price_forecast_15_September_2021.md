Dollar wants to win the war. Forecast as of 15.09.2021Dmitri Demidenko

The [EURUSD][1] surge amid a weak report on the US inflation was a
Pyrrhic victory for the bulls. The price quickly returned to the bottom
of figure 18, which looks logical ahead of the FOMC meeting. Let us
discuss the Forex outlook and make up a trading plan.

## Weekly US dollar fundamental forecast

One should be a daredevil to sell the US dollar just because of the
slowdown in inflation a week before the FOMC meeting, at which the
central bank may present a hawkish surprise. In August, the US _c_
onsumer-price index rose  _0.3_ % M-o-M, slower than the 0.5% one-month
increase in July, falling short of Bloomberg experts’ forecasts. The CPI
performance has turned out to be the worst over the past seven months,
which should theoretically reduce the likelihood of the Fed deciding to
scale back QE in September. Fortunately, [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) verdicts are not
made based on a single report.

### Dynamics of US consumer prices

At first glance, the slowdown in CPI from 5.4% to 5.3% and core
inflation from 4.3% to 4% Y-o-Y proves that the high inflation pressure
in the US is temporary. Furthermore, the drivers of the inflation growth
associated with the pandemic, like the prices for used cars and air
tickets, are fading away. Nonetheless, the greenback could lose the
battle but win the war. The former drivers of consumer price growth are
replaced by the new ones, like rent, furniture, and new cars. The debate
about the temporary nature of excessively high inflation has not
subsided, but in fact, the Fed does not care much about what is
happening to the CPI and PCE now. It is much more important for the
central bank what will happen to the indicators in the spring.

In this regard, the moderately disappointing August consumer price
report is unlikely to force the central bank to reverse its chosen path
of normalizing monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). To postpone the decision to start it, at
least one more weak release of employment data is needed. Already in
September, despite the slowdown in GDP, the labour market, and
inflation, the Fed may decide to taper the QE. The Fed argues that high
inflation is temporary, and purchases of assets accelerate it.

The mismatch between what the market sees (deterioration in US macro
statistics) and what the central bank can do causes uncertainty and
encourages [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s to buy the greenback on the corrections. A typical
example was the reaction of [EURUSD][1] to the inflation report. The
bulls lacked some 5 pips to reach the level of 1.185 indicated in the
previous material, after which the price quickly fell, proving the euro
buyers’ weakness.

The main euro benefits are still a better epidemiological situation in
Europe than in the USA and the associated expectations of faster GDP
growth in the euro area compared to the United States in the third
quarter.

### Dynamics and forecasts for GDP

Global economic growth will not accelerate without support from China
and the USA. In addition, when only a week is left before the FOMC
meeting, the market is focused on monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), forgetting about GDP.

### Weekly[ EURUSD][2] trading plan

I believe that the [EURUSD][1] will be more likely to go down to 1.17
amid the approaching Fed’s meeting. In this situation, selling the pair
on the price growth will be relevant if it doesn’t go back above 1.1845
or on the breakout of the support at 1.18.
