Aussie: fun is over. Forecast as of 14.09.2021Dmitri Demidenko

When a currency has as many problems as the Australian dollar, its
strengthening surprises both [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s and the Reserve Bank. How will
this affect [AUDUSD][1]? Let's figure it out and make up a trading plan.

## Monthly Australian dollar fundamental forecast

Looking at the dynamics of [AUDUSD][1], one can see that the market is
full of optimists. They are confident that Australia's imminent lift of
lockdowns will accelerate its GDP in the fourth quarter, weak statistics
on China will force the PBoC to increase monetary stimulus, and the fall
in iron ore prices is temporary. They buy Aussie on rumors. The problem
is that there is usually a huge difference between desire and reality.

What is happening with the financial markets is puzzling not only to me,
but also to Philip Lowe. The head of the RBA noted that accelerating
inflation and economic recovery could provoke other central banks to
normalize monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). But Australia has its own [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/). The
Reserve Bank's experience in inflation and wages suggests that it is not
worth counting on an increase in the cash rate in 2022 or early 2023, as
derivatives do. The rate will remain at a record low level until 2024.

As the RBA expects a 2% decline in GDP in the third quarter due to
lockdowns with the wording "perhaps much more," it is difficult to
understand why the [AUDUSD][1] price soared so high. Is it time to come
down to earth?

Iron ore, a key component of Australian exports, soared to a record high
of $230 per ton in May. However, then a decline began, which continues
to this day. However, optimists are confident that it will end soon. The
fate of iron ore is decided by China, which intends to fix steel
production at just over 1 billion in 2021. In the first half of the
year, the companies faced overproduction, and now they are forced to
curtail their activities to meet the established quotas.

Good [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) from the talks between the presidents of the United States and
China and the expectation of a new monetary stimulus from the PBoC,
which could accelerate China's economy, had a positive impact on the
yuan. Xi Jinping said it was time to get the relationship back on track.
However, it is unlikely that Joe Biden will cancel the import duties
imposed by Donald Trump.

A serious risk factor for AUDUSD is the development of the [S&P 500][2]
correction against the background of the Fed's faster transition to
normalization of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) than [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s currently expect.
Another factor is the rejection by Congress of the new fiscal stimulus
project from Democrats. These events will contribute to the
strengthening of the US dollar against the major world currencies.

### Monthly [AUDUSD][1] trading plan

Fun's over. This is what can be said about the [AUDUSD][1] bulls. I
recommend selling the pair in the direction of levels 0.728, 0.722, and
0.714. The release of weaker statistics on the Australian labor market
than Bloomberg experts expect and the publication of data on Chinese
retail sales and industrial production can be considered [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) reasons.
