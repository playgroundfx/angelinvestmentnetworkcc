Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 14.09.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

Cryptocurrency prices continue falling. The previous lows should be
updated soon.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

The BTCUSD market is forming a new down wave that has started after the
long-term corrective wave [B] completed. Based on the inceptive part of
the wave, it should be unfolding as an impulse 1-2-3-4-5. It is clear
from the chart that the first two legs have finished. There is
developing impulse 3. The first two sub-waves seem to have completed
within impulse 3. The price should continue declining to a level below
the low of 41800.00, marked by wave 1. One could enter sell trades in
the current situation.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Sell 45257.00, TP 41800.00

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

The XRPUSD market is forming a new downtrend. It is clear from the most
recent chart section that the linking wave (X) finished, the market
turned down and started declining. There should be forming a bearish
impulse wave with the first two sub-waves completed inside; the third
wave has just started developing. The Ripple price should continue
declining towards a level of 0.950 and lower.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] **** today:

Sell 1.070, TP 0.950

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

The ETHUSD market is forming a new impulse down wave that has started
after corrective wave B completed. In the B wave, sub-waves 1 and 2
completed, and wave 3 is unfolding. According to the Elliott wave
theory, the third sub-waves usually have an impulsive structure. So far,
sub-waves [1] and [2] have finished, the remaining three waves should be
developing in the near future, driving the Ethereum price to a level
below the low of 2895.00. One could enter sell trades in the current
situation.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Sell 3292.92, TP 2895.00
