Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 14.09.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

Yesterday, the euro broke out the Intermediary Zone 1.1820 - 1.1812.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

Yesterday, oil reached the resistance level of 70.33. This level was the
main target for purchases in the zone of 67.87 - 67.17. Now the level
70.33 has been broken out, so now a new target is Target Zone 2 72.85 -
72.32.

It is profitable to look for new purchases on correction at strong
supports: Additional Zone 69.63 - 69.50 and Intermediary Zone 68.36 -
68.10.

To sell oil, a trend reversal by breaking out the Intermediary Zone and
price consolidation below are required.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

  1. Buy according to the pattern in Additional Zone 69.63 - 69.50. TakeProfit: Target Zone 2 72.85 - 72.32. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. Buy according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 68.36 - 68.10. TakeProfit: Target Zone 2 72.85 - 72.32. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

The XAUUSD bears are trying to break out support level 1787 within a
short-term downtrend. If successful, the next target for sales will be
the Gold Zone 1772-1770.

Otherwise, the price will rise to the Intermediary Zone 1805 - 1803
which serves as the trend's key resistance. In this case, watch if
buyers manage to break out the zone and reverse the trend, or a false
breakout of the September 10 high and a new decline will occur.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

Watch the market.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

Yesterday, the euro broke out the Intermediary Zone 1.1820 - 1.1812, but
the price closed within the zone at the US trading session. Therefore,
it is too early to draw conclusions about the short-term trend's
reversal down. However, the preconditions have been created, so the euro
key resistance for the next few days is the zone of 1.1867 - 1.1858.

If the resistance of 1.1867 - 1.1858 is broken out as part of the
growth, then there will be every reason to buy the euro with the target
at the upper Target Zone 1.1963 - 1.1946.

If the resistance 1.1867 - 1.1858 is held, and then a sell pattern is
formed, it will be possible to sell the euro with the target at the
lower Target Zone 1.1733 - 1.1715.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

Sell according to the pattern in the zone of 1.1867 - 1.1858.
TakeProfit: 1.1774, Target Zone 1.1733 - 1.1715. StopLoss: according to
the pattern rules.
