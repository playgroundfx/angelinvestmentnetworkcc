analysis Bitcoin, Ripple, Ethereum.][2]**

The BTCUSD market is forming the final element of the large impulse
wave. There is now developing wave [5], where sub-waves (1)-(2)-(3) have
completed, and there is now forming the sideways corrective wave (4). It
can complete as a horizontal contracting triangle A-B-C-D-E. The price
is now likely to be declining in the corrective wave C. An approximate
trajectory of the Bitcoin future price movement is outlined in the
chart.

There is now forming a zigzag-shaped pattern, where corrective wave (B)
has recently completed. Wave (B) is composed of the sub-waves W-X-Y.
Now, the market is moving up in the impulse wave (C). Within this
impulse, there is developing the sideways correction 4 that is likely to
complete as a contracting triangle. When the sub-waves [c]-[d]-[e]
complete within this triangle, the price could resume rising in wave 5,
as it is outlined in the chart.

###  **Elliott wave[ETHUSD][5] analysis**

The ETHUSD market continues following the long-term uptrend. Within the
impulse wave A, there is developing the final impulse 5, namely its
fourth element. So, there is now unfolding the corrective wave (4) that
may complete as a double three w-x-y. The sub-waves w and x look
complete, so, the price should be declining in wave y for some time. The
entire wave [5] should finish at a level of 420.00.
