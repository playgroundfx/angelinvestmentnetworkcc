Marshall Gittler’s weekly comment: busy week!Marshall Gittler

 **The week behind us:  May caves, Powell confirms “Powell Put”**

![LiteForex: ][1]

GBP was the best performing G10 currency after UK PM May basically caved
in to demands that Parliament should have more of a say in the Brexit
decision and there should be the possibility of a delay in Brexit rather
than just “my deal or no deal.” However, her concession wasn’t as much
of a concession as it seems; any delay (assuming the EU grants her one)
is based around the timing of the European Parliament election in May.
If Britain takes part in that election, it can keep on extending Brexit
after the EU Parliament is seated on 1 July. But if it doesn’t take
part, then 1 July becomes an absolutely unextendible “cliff edge”
deadline for Brexit. Her strategy is to take Britain to that cliff edge
and say “now it’s either my deal or no deal,” and hope that MPs vote for
the deal. I think that might work, which would be positive for GBP. But
it’s a hell of a way to run a country.

Fed Chair Powell confirmed that the Fed is rethinking its inflation
target and may consider allowing an overshoot of inflation to compensate
for periods of undershooting. He also more or less confirmed the
existence of the “Powell Put” by saying that a change in broader
financial conditions “matters for the macroeconomy, it matters for the
achievement of the dual mandate,” and the Fed will therefore take change
in broader financial conditions into account.

This gives rise to two questions:  1) how do you measure “broader
financial conditions” and 2) what is the reaction function by which you
take those changes into account? Because the fact is, their own
financial conditions index hasn’t shown any significant tightening
recently, and indeed was lower at the time of the January FOMC meeting
than it was in December, when they did hike rates.

![LiteForex: ][2]

Same with the VIX index – equity market volatility was much higher in
December than in January. So I’m still not sure what their reaction
function is reacting to, unless maybe it’s the fact that volatility
moved higher – and the stock market even lower – immediately after that
meeting.

![LiteForex: ][3]

Finally, we had the long-awaited testimony by Trump’s lawyer/fixer,
Michael Cohen. He was devastating about Trump, accusing him of an
“expansive pattern of lies and criminality,” as the NY Times put it –
although his claim that he saw no “collusion” between the campaign and
Russia to sway the election seems doubtful, IMHO.

My favorite exchange was:

Rep. Gosar: "You're a pathological liar. You don't know truth from
falsehood. So again—”

Michael Cohen: "Sorry -- are you referring to me or the President?"

The coming week:  lots going on!

The coming week is filled with important indicators and events:  three
central bank meetings, the US nonfarm payrolls, and the start of China’s
National People’s Congress.

For the central banks, we get the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) on
Tuesday, the Bank of Canada (BoC) on Wednesday, and the European Central
Bank (ECB) on Thursday. Frankly though, I’m getting bored writing about
central banks. Most of them are now on hold once again, so all we’re
talking about is whether there will be any subtle change in bias, not a
real change in stance. We’re mostly trying to understand how the central
bankers see the world and how long they are likely to keep rates on
hold. We’re really just looking for scraps of information.

In this context, the RBA is probably the worst of the lot. Unlike most
other central banks, which meet eight times a year, they meet 11 times a
year (no meeting in January). So I’m going to  have to write about them
every month for the rest of the year. And currently, the market sees
just over 50% (55%) chance of a cut in rates this year. In other words,
every month I’m going to have to review the reasons why they probably
won’t make any changes in [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). This is expected to last at least
until around August, when the possibility of a change rises to 41%.
Perhaps I should save my comments each month and just update the numbers
and graph?

![LiteForex: ][4]

Recent commentary from RBA Governor Lowe has made clear that the RBA
doesn’t plan any changes in [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) any time soon. The focus will still
be on the labor market and inflation, as it has been for the last 30
years. "In the event of a sustained increase in the unemployment rate
and a lack of further progress towards the inflation objective, lower
interest rates might be appropriate at some point," he said on 6
February. And again on 22 Feb, he said “It is appropriate to maintain
the current [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) setting while we assess developments. Much will
depend on what happens in our labor market."

It’s true that they haven’t met their inflation target yet. The
inflation rate is just below (1.8%) their 2%-3% target range and has
been for some time. However, this problem isn’t unique to Australia;
every central bank is having the same issue. And Japan has proven that
low interest rates can’t necessarily solve this issue.

![LiteForex: ][5]

Meanwhile, the Governor’s stress on the labor market makes a change in
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) much less likely. The unemployment rate is as low as it’s been in
ages, and employment growth is holding up well too. I expect little
change in stance at this week’s meeting and little for the markets to
get excited about.

![LiteForex: ][6]

There’s hardly more tension associated with the BoC. The market had been
going for a rate hike, but now the betting centers on rates being
unchanged for all of this year, with some chance of one hike.

![LiteForex: ][7]

BoC Gov. Poloz recently made a speech in which he discussed the
limitations to monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). The first limitation, he said, was that
since monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) has only one instrument, the Bank cannot use
interest rates to target more than one variable. “Ultimately, inflation
is the sole target of the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).”

Given that all three of the “core” measures of inflation that the BoC
used to guide its monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) are just about at the middle of their
1%-3% target range, they should be very happy with [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) at the moment.
I see no reason for them to change in either direction. The meeting
should be a relative non-event for the markets, I would think.

![LiteForex: ][8]

The ECB is more interesting than the others, because they have started
to question their own narrative. The Eurozone economy is slowing down
more than they expected and inflation is accelerating more slowly than
they expected as a result. This may necessitate a subtle change in their
stance.

As for rates, the market thinks there’s a 50-50 chance that they will
raise rates this year, otherwise they’ll be unchanged.

![LiteForex: ][9]

But that’s a story for later this year. The market thinks if it’s likely
to happen at all, it’s likely to happen towards the end of the year.

![LiteForex: ][10]

So for now the question will be just how do they see the Eurozone
economy developing and are they making – or likely to make -- any
progress towards their inflation goal. After the last meeting, ECB
President Draghi said, “On the basis of current futures prices for oil,
headline inflation is likely to decline further over the coming months.”
The March meeting will bring with it an updated set of forecasts. The
last update, in December, gave a profile of 1.6% in 2019, rising to 1.7%
in 20210 and 1.8% in 2021—i.e., still trending towards their goal of
inflation “below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.” If they revise
down their inflation forecast, can they continue on their [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
normalization path? My guess is that they may once again revise it down
for 2019 but leave 2020 and 2021 alone – that’s far enough away that
they can pretend it’s going to happen. That way they won’t have to
change their [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) stance right now.

![LiteForex: ][11]

This is of course just a polite fiction that nobody really believes. The
5yr/5yr inflation swap, which Draghi himself identified as his preferred
gauge of inflation expectations, now indicates that the market expects
inflation to remain around the current level for the next five years –
and it’s been trending lower if anything.

![LiteForex: ][12]

There’s also the question about what the ECB should do with their long-
term refinancing operations (LTROs). These non-standard financing help
for banks have been in operation continuously since the global financial
crisis of 2008. There’s still some EUR 720bn outstanding in targeted
LTROs (TLRTO). They start to mature in June of 2020 and the ECB is
wondering what to do about it:  let it roll off (what they would do if
the economy were healthy and they were normalizing [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)), or replace
it in whole or in part, and if so, how. They still have some time to
think about this issue so they may not decide at this meeting. The
market will want to see any clues.

As for the indicators, it’s once again time for the US nonfarm payrolls!
(NFP) I’ve said repeatedly that I think the importance of this indicator
is overblown. Unlike the RBA, the Fed believes that has achieved its
goal of “maximum employment,” if indeed “maximum employment” can be
measured by the unemployment rate.

Some people would argue that full employment can only be measured by
looking at wages. That is, you’re not at full employment until workers
can extract more money from their employers and the return to labor goes
up relative to the return to capital. What we see here is encouraging:
the employment cost index (ECI) is trending upwards, while the quit rate
– the percentage of people who leave their jobs voluntarily each month –
is rising too, indicating that employees have a lot more confidence in
the job market nowadays. However, the ECI isn’t rising anywhere nearly
as rapidly as it was before the GFC, so the Fed probably doesn’t have to
worry about wage-cost inflation (remember that?) any time soon.

![LiteForex: ][13]

In any event, the market is looking for some mean reversion in payrolls
after two months of above-trend gains in payrolls. The consensus
forecast of 185k is pretty close to what the six-month moving average
was in August, September, and November. It seems as good a guess as any.
The unemployment rate is expected to fall back to 3.9% from 4.0%, i.e.
to remain in its recent range (it’s been between 3.7% and 4.0% since
last March).

![LiteForex: ][14]

Given my argument above about [how to](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-trading-how-to/) determine full employment, the
average hourly earnings are probably more important than the NFP figure
itself. Here too, the consensus is for reversion to the mean. Basically,
80% of the time the mom change is either +0.1%, +0.2% or +0.3%. Since
last month it was +0.1%, the low end of the usual range, the market
assumes this month it will come out on the high end of the usual range,
namely +0.3%. That would push the yoy rate back up to 3.3%, the peak for
this economic cycle. That I think would suggest the labor market remains
strong and therefore would be beneficial for the dollar.

![LiteForex: ][15]

China’s National People’s Congress will start on 5 March. Premier Li
will present the government’s draft working plan for 2019. Global
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s will be focusing on the 2019 growth target. Last year’s target
was “around 6.5%,” which was met (the average yoy growth rate for all
quarters was 6.6%, while it finished the year at 6.4%).

![LiteForex: ][16]

Among China’s 31 provinces, 24 have lowered their growth targets for
2019 while only two raised them, so we can assume that the national
growth target will be lowered as well. The only question is how far. The
further they target below 6.5%, the worse for the commodity currencies,
I would assume. I think anything below 6% would be a big shock, while
6%-6.5% would probably be within the range of expectations.

Investors will also be interested in fiscal and monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) and how
much additional stimulus, if any, the government will provide. The
market consensus is for some further fiscal stimulus, while monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) is likely to remain “prudent,” especially given the friction with
the US over currency [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). China’s monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) plays an important
part in driving the country’s economy and thereby driving world
commodity prices.

![LiteForex: ][17]

Other things to watch out for during the week:  there are a number of
Bank of England speakers: Gov. Carney testifies to the House of Lords on
Tuesday, while Monetary Policy Committee members Cunliffe and Saunders
speak on Wednesday and Tenreyro on Thursday. The Fed releases the Beige
Book on Wednesday.
