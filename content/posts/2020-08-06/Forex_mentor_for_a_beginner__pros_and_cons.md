Forex mentor for a beginner: pros and consOleg Tkachenko

The article covers the following subjects:

## How can you find the Top Forex trading coach?

How a beginner can start trading forex? Should you study the basics on
your own or work with a professional coach? Studying the Forex market
with a trading coach seems to be more reasonable. A mentor will show a
way in trading, so a beginner will save much time.

A trading tutor will point out the common errors in trading, share
his/her experience, help you make your first steps in trading.

On the other hand, most of the so-called free [Forex trading](https://www.fintechee.com/forex-trading-strategies/) mentor aims
at making money or luring [beginners](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-for-beginners/) to the “kitchen”. Read on and you
will find out everything about the aims and methods of dishonest forex
teachers. You will also learn where to find a professional forex coach
and [how to](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-trading-how-to/) choose the best one.

### My honest thoughts about modern “teachers” of trading

"He who can, does. He who cannot, teaches." These words written by
George Bernard Shaw are still relevant. There is plenty of information
on the Internet to learn Forex yourself.

There are also many Forex mentors/coaches willing to teach beginner
forex traders for free. However, it can end up with negative results for
a student.

Not all of the teachers offering their services have the required
qualifications and can share their experience.

Not all of the teachers offering their services have the required skills
and can share their experience. Their “Forex training” comes down to
describing common theories that you can well read on the Internet on
your own. Or they just describing the Forex trading tools that do not
work. At best, a student wastes time, at worst – money.

How to choose the right Forex mentor? I will try to answer in this
review.

### Forex training for a beginner: pros and cons of modern trading
coaching

Do you, like every beginner trader, come up with the question of what to
start with? Learn Forex on online free trading courses?

Learn trading yourself starting with a demo account? Pay to a
professional Forex trading mentor? Do not decide in haste. First, answer
the following questions:

  * If you were a successful trader and made good money on trading, would you spend your time on something that won’t yield you any income? (For example, would you teach someone for free or for a nominal cost, spending much time on it?)
  * If you had a profitable trading system, would you share it with someone for free?

Of course, there are enthusiasts willing to show off their achievements
for the sake of raising self-esteem. But they are rather an exception.
The majority simply want to monetize their knowledge.

I am now writing about those “teachers” who have recently flooded the
Internet with their offers to teach newbies professional trading. These
trading coaches usually lure people with a yield of 100% per annum and
higher.

I am in no way diminishing the merits of such great theorists and
practitioners of financial markets as Warren Buffett or Bill Williams.
But as practice shows, at best, most courses turn out to be a waste of
time for [beginners](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-for-beginners/), at worst, they lose money.

### What Forex trading mentors can be like

The division into these groups is conditional, but it will help me give
a general idea of what kinds of trading coaches are in the financial
markets.

  1. "Pseudo teachers". This may include those who, in fact, hide other goals behind their willingness to teach.
  2. Trading mentors who aim at teaching their students something and share their experience with the next generation (the question of the cost of such training is not fundamental).

I will describe both groups in more detail below in each section. But,
first, I will share my own experience.

####  **An example from my own experience of learning trading with forex
mentorship**

>  **Negative experience.** My acquaintance with Forex and trading took
place in the second year of the Banking Academy. When I saw an offer to
take a basic trading training course for trading for free, I of course
took up that idea.

>

> There were two arguments for. It partly related to my future
profession, and most importantly, it was free! I was also bribed by the
fact that the course organizer was an actively promoted broker at that
time.

>

> I had no complaints about the training itself. I first got acquainted
with the concepts of quotes, the basics of technical and fundamental
analysis, etc. The course was interesting for a person who had no idea
about this, (I will add that at that time I had limited access to the
Internet). But at the end of the course, I was quite surprised.

>

> At the end of the training course in that trading [academy](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/online-trading-academy-reviews/), all
students were asked to pass an exam, which was about 30 questions on the
course passed. It was not difficult to pass it, but the results of the
exam were announced individually to everyone in a personal conversation.
Only later did I understand why.

>

> Each student was asked to complete the second stage of training by
opening a real deposit of $100. Moreover, the "mentor" himself promised
to supervise trading for real money, guaranteeing almost a 100% return.

>

> I responded to the mentor with a counteroffer. If he guaranteed almost
a 100% chance of profit, I was ready to try myself in trading but on
credit. I asked for a loan and promised to return him his $100 with
interest when I made my first profit. He didn’t accept my offer for some
reason… That is all you need to know about free Forex training courses.

![LiteForex: Forex mentor for a beginner: pros and cons][2]

>  **Positive experience.** My desire to study trading in the financial
markets and develop my trading skills was still strong. I wanted to be
if not a professional trader, then at least, a forex analyst (trading is
great psychological stress) was still strong.

>

> On one of the forums, I met some interesting guys who turned out to be
active traders working with one of the pretty good brokers. Common
chatting developed into Skype communication (now, it is even more
convenient to communicate via Zoom). Later, we completely switched to
the format described above.

>

> At first, I practiced currency trading a little under their guidance
on a demo account. This is not difficult if you open the screen or use
the TeamViewer program. Then I registered using the affiliate link of
one of them and, again under the guidance, but already on a real
account, I tried to enter my first trades.

>

> This guidance, assistance in the first steps (I’ll note it was free!)
helped me understand the basics of trading at least at the initial
level. Nobody taught me everything from scratch, explaining every
nuance. It was not training in the literal sense of the word. It was
mentoring.

>

> They guided me, gave me recommendations, showed real examples of
entering trades. I could study the theory of trading myself, but only
with the help of my mentors, I could get the practical experience of
trading.

I cannot say that all trading courses, seminars, and paid subscriptions
are scams. However, the lack of control and [regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/) results in
irresponsibility. Of course, [fraud](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/cryptocurrency-fraud/)sters also try to profit from the
gullibility of beginner traders. You should wisely choose those who you
will learn from.

### How to choose top forex mentors? Key points to focus on.

I classified the first group of [Forex trading](https://www.fintechee.com/forex-trading-strategies/) mentors as "pseudo
teachers". They may try to share their experience and knowledge with
their students, but the real goals are different.

 **The most common goals pursued by the phony trading teachers:**

  *  **They want to sell their financial product.** They urge you to invest in their investment portfolio, buy their Expert Advisor, trading indicator, subscribe to their trading signals. Here, the plan is simple.

Much is anonymous on the Internet and a trader can’t claim to any
authority. The investment portfolio can be a fake, the EA sold could be
a slightly changed modification of a free [robot](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/automated-forex-trading-robot/).

  *  **They want to promote their [website](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/website-for-forex-trading/)/channel to attract advertisers or promote affiliate links.** The goal of the “teacher” is to increase traffic or make profits from an affiliate program. As a rule, such people do not know the Forex theory well and have never make a stable income in Forex.

The articles posted on the [website](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/website-for-forex-trading/) are the product of the team of
authors (copywriters) who rewrite information from other resources.
Practice shows that the profitability of such a business is relatively
low. The owner of the resource can’t afford professional articles by
experienced traders, therefore the professional value of such resources
can be questioned.

  *  **They want to attract subscribers.** The goal is similar, they want to make money by promoting their video channel. The task of the “teacher” is to be able to explain in an interesting, understandable, logical, and humorous manner.

Diction wins over well. And it doesn't matter that the “teacher” is
telling complete nonsense, or banality, like forex charts in trading.
Professionals, as a rule, do not spend time on such channels, and most
[beginners](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-for-beginners/) stop at watching videos and do not go further. What do you
think is the quality of information on such channels?

Simply put, such teachers aim at urging an inexperienced beginner trader
to invest in a kitchen, subscribe to paid signals, buy a trading tool,
and so on.

Can you call it [fraud](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/cryptocurrency-fraud/)? It is a difficult question. On the one hand,
these people do teach some basics of trading currency pairs. On the
other hand, they use the trust of their students to their advantage.

So, a beginner trader interested in Forex should look for a trading
tutor who is will benefit from the success of the student. By the way, I
recommend you read you an interesting overview that can help you analyze
the information on the Internet. [How traders are brainwashed or a
battle of trolls][3].

But still, despite my subjective skepticism about “Forex trading
mentors” described above, things are not that bad. There are successful
professional traders willing to share their experiences. They are humans
and they need to help, to have attention and recognition.

They also sometimes want to take a break from trading by switching to
something else. But, unlike pseudo-teachers, they have earned authority
with their trading results, and it is quite logical that they are
unlikely to share them just for nothing.

### How to find the right Forex mentor? A few good tips

This section will deal with real professional Forex trading mentors or
coaches. The mentors, I referred to the second group in the first
section (those who are interested in teaching) also want to get the most
out of their help. Their goals:

  *  **Financial goals.** I mean paid training. It refers to some well-known trading academies. However, you should understand that a professional trader will teach only if it is more profitable for him/her than trading.

Such courses will hardly be cheap **,** although it is possible that the
trader simply likes to alternate trading with training.

  *  **Psychological motivation.** Some people tend to be popular, you might even call it vanity. They love to be talked about and admired for their success.

To get recognition and popularity, they are even ready to teach for a
nominal fee. However, you can forget about the individual approach to
the student in this case.

  *  **Enthusiasm.** There is a category of people who want to benefit others and they are ready to transfer their knowledge only for the sake of the process itself. To be honest, I do not know people among professionals who are ready to teach someone and spend their time just for the sake of humanity.
  *  **Extra income.** It partially corresponds to what I have already written before. It refers to affiliate programs. Professional traders are interested in developing an affiliate network and profits made by their referrals.

Therefore, they are willing to spend part of their time in newbies to
help beginner traders gain experience.

There is a category of people for whom trading is contraindicated due to
psychological and emotional instability. They may have excellent trading
experience and knowledge, but they do not have a positive trading
[history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/). The reason for their failure is excitement, imbalance. But they
can be excellent teachers because the negative experience is also
experience.

You can learn their knowledge and take into account psychological
mistakes. This way, you will be able to learn from such mentors the best
and use this knowledge in building your [Forex trading](https://www.fintechee.com/forex-trading-strategies/) system.

I will dwell on training from partners (via affiliate programs) in more
detail. I believe that it is one of the simplest, most effective,
ratings [provided by the broker][4].

 **1\. A forex partner is interested in the success of his/her referral
because:**

  *  **A Forex partner will recommend to the student the broker who he/she has been working for a long time with.** The partner is interested both in maintaining his/her reputation and in long-term cooperation with the referral who is now a student.
  *  **A partner receives a profit from each referral attracted.** Therefore, the partners are interested in the success of their referral students. After all, if the newly attracted traders trade with a profit, then they will hardly leave Forex.
  * Partners are interested in the success of their referrals, their reputation, and popularity in the trader community can attract new referral traders.

![LiteForex: Forex mentor for a beginner: pros and cons][5]

There is one nuance. A [Forex trading](https://www.fintechee.com/forex-trading-strategies/) mentor will hardly waste time
explaining the theory, so the students will have to study a lot on their
own. The task of the mentor is to share the working trading systems.
They also help students avoid common mistakes beginner traders make, to
point out any features of the broker/indicator/forex chart/ trading
platform.

And the right trading mentor will be willing to help you if he/she sees
your desire to learn [Forex trading](https://www.fintechee.com/forex-trading-strategies/). At least, if the trader is not
engaged in teaching, he/she can always suggest who you can [contact](https://www.playgroundfx.com/contact/).

Brokers now see significant advantages in working with such professional
traders. Professional traders see brokers as a platform for their PR. It
is quite logical that they will not risk their reputation by cooperating
with knowingly [fraud](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/cryptocurrency-fraud/)ulent companies.

Brokers, in turn, are interested in attracting professional partners.
Professionals, instead of “making money at any cost”, would aim at
teaching trading to newbies, transfer their knowledge, or at least point
out the direction.

Therefore, I can say that it is the most optimal way, in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of money
and return, to look for a Forex mentor through professional trader
forums. Or you can search on trading forums/blogs organized by brokerage
companies.

### How a beginner can find a good trading coach or mentor:

  *  **Define clear targets, make up a plan.** Before looking for a mentor, you need to understand what you want to achieve, the final result. If you know your goal, you will understand what you want from the mentor.
  *  **Do you want to complete a full course of study or just gain practical trading experience?** Or, maybe, you want to understand certain types of [trading strategies](https://www.fintechee.com/forex-trading-strategies/) and choose the best forex system for you.
  *  **Study the basics of trading yourself.** There many free books on trading on the Internet. You can get a general idea of trading and financial markets, study the general concepts of Forex and trading tools. A forex mentor will help you apply this knowledge to practice, prevent you from most common trading errors, share unique experiences.

Communicate as much as possible on professional trading forums, read
brokers' blogs (why broker blogs, I explained above. The reputation is
important to brokers, so the criteria for selecting authors are very
high here!). This will help you understand the level of the Forex
mentor’s skills in a particular aspect.

I want to again stress that you should not look for a forex mentor based
on search queries on the Internet. Ignore individual investment blogs
with intrusive ads for specific brokers and referral links. All those
forex coaches are likely to fall in the first group of the pseudo-
teachers, who I described in the first section.

Look for [Forex trading](https://www.fintechee.com/forex-trading-strategies/) mentors among people who do not seek to promote
their coaching services. Search on the professional trader or [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)
forums, in the [traders’ [ranking](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/crypto-exchange-ranking/)s][6] on brokers’ [website](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/website-for-forex-trading/)s and [trader
blogs][7] posted by brokers.

Be self-motivated. When the teacher sees your desire, the desire to
learn, and practice, he/she will share his experience with you with
greater efficiency.

Do not be afraid to [contact](https://www.playgroundfx.com/contact/) professional traders directly. For example,
chat or email the [best traders of the broker's [ranking](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/crypto-exchange-ranking/)s][6] and ask who
they can recommend as a trading mentor and on what [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/). They may
provide you with some useful information or, if you're lucky, they will
take you as a student themselves.

 **Conclusion.** Try to rely only on yourself. Set goals, make up a
plan, practice your knowledge and trading skills on a demo account.
Listen only to yourself and trust only yourself. Do not spend your money
in haste.

If you decide that you need trading courses /seminars/ forex tutors,
ignore those who convincingly impose advertising without giving relevant
knowledge or showing sufficient experience.

Pay attention to analytical resources, brokers, professional trading
communities (MyFxBook, TradingView), where you can find proven
professional traders.
