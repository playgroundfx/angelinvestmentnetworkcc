EUR/USD forecast: Euro will find support in AsiaDmitri Demidenko

## Fundamental Euro forecast for today

### The escalation of the US-China trade war may not result in the
EUR/USD correction

The US stock indexes featured the worst [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) drop over the past four
weeks amid a number of negative factors that discouraged [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s. The
number of the US initial weekly jobless claims has increased, the
diplomatic conflict between Washington and Beijing has been escalated,
and the number of new COVID-19 continues rising. According to Wells
Fargo Securities, the US dollar is likely to gain back its positions
because of the US stocks. If the [S&P500 ][1]declines much, the demand
for the greenback will quickly rebound. I do not share this opinion.

Unlike the commodity currencies, the euro has hardly responded to the
drop in the US stock indexes. Yes, the increase in the number of jobless
claims from 1.3 million to 1.4 million is a negative factor. The U.S.
Department of Labor refers to the week through July 17 as the benchmark
for its July report, but the report fits in well with the idea of the
Nike-shaped recovery of the US GDP. This idea is also confirmed with the
leading indicator of the Atlanta Fed.

### Dynamics of the U.S. economic recovery

According to Moody's Analytics, unless lawmakers quickly pass additional
stimulus legislation, the risk of a double-dip recession will be
increasing. The unemployment rate will remain in double digits until the
pandemic ends. Axa Investment Managers notes that the US PMI will be
declining until the number of coronavirus cases reaches its peak.
Investors are more likely to accept the idea of the W-shaped recovery of
US growth.

In my opinion, Congress should soon approve of the new fiscal stimulus
package of $1 trillion. In addition to the huge volumes of cheap
liquidity provided by the Fed and good [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) about the coronavirus
vaccine, it should prevent a deep correction of the [S&P500][1]. Another
matter is the US-China relations that are getting tenser and tenser. As
a retaliation to the closure of the Chinese consulate in Houston,
Beijing ordered the closure of the U.S. consulate in Chengdu.US
secretary of state Mike Pompeo called for an end to "blind engagement"
with China. Donald Trump said the U.S.-China trade deal means much less
to him now due to the tensions over the coronavirus. Donald Trump tries
to shift the blame for the incompetent response to the COVID-19
outbreak, but Beijing responds to his attacks, which it didn’t in 2019.

Most of China's foreign-exchange reserves (the total is over $3
trillion) are held in U.S. dollar-denominated financial assets. It is
because there are no alternatives. However, the issuance of bonds by the
European Commission on behalf of the EU allows these alternatives to
emerge. Yes, €750 billion is not that big amount, but it could become
the beginning of the greenback’s end. China, insulted by Trump, won’t
make concessions. Therefore, even the drop in the US stock indexes won’t
necessarily result in the [EUR/USD][3] correction down. Euro will find
support in Asia.

In the short-term, the market should respond to the release of the
German and European PMI data for July. I expect that the actual data
close to the forecasts could trigger a short drop in the [EUR/USD][3]
price amid the principle “buy on rumors, sell on facts”. If the actual
data are much higher than the expectations, the euro can continue its
rally towards $1.17.
