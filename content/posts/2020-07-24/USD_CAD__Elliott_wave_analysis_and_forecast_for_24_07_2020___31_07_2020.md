USD/CAD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 24/07/2020 –
31/07/2020Alex Geuta

## [USD/CAD][1] remains likely to fall. Estimated pivot point is at a
level of 1.3494.

 **Main scenario:** consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 1.3494 with a target of 1.3315 – 1.3189.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
1.3494 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 1.3643 –
1.3718.

 **Analysis:** Supposedly, an ascending corrective wave of larger degree
(B) of 4 finished developing on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame and wave (C) of 4
started forming. The first wave 1 of (C) is developing on the H4 time
frame, with wave v of 1 forming inside. Apparently, the third wave of
smaller degree (iii) of v is developing on the H1 time frame.  If this
assumption is correct, the pair will continue to fall to 1.3315 –
1.3189. The level of 1.3494 is critical in this scenario as the breakout
will enable the pair to continue rising to the levels of 1.3643 –
1.3718.
