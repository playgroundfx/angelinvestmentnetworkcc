GBP/USD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 24/07/2020 –
31/07/2020Alex Geuta

## [GBP/USD][1] remains likely to grow. Estimated pivot point is at a
level of 1.2642.

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions from corrections above the
level of 1.2642 with a target of 1.2820 – 1.2980.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
1.2642 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of 1.2505
– 1.2436.

 **Analysis:** Supposedly, the fifth wave of larger degree V finished
developing on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame, with wave  (С) of V completed
inside. On the H4 time frame, supposedly, the first counter-trend wave
(1) of 1 formed and a local correction finished developing in the form
of flat-shaped wave (2) of 1. Wave (3) has started forming. Apparently,
the first wave of smaller degree 1 of (3) continues forming on the H1
time frame, with wave v of 1 developing inside. If the presumption is
correct, the pair will continue to rise to the levels of 1.2820 –
1.2980. The level of 1.2642 is critical in this scenario as the breakout
will enable the pair to continue declining to the levels of 1.2505 –
1.2436.
