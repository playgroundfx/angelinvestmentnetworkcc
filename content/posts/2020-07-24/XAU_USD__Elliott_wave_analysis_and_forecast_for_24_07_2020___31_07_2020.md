XAU/USD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 24/07/2020 –
31/07/2020Alex Geuta

## Ascending trend of [XAU/USD][1] continues Estimated pivot point is at
a level of 1857.99.

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions from corrections above the
level of 1857.99 with a target of 1915.00 – 1930.00.

 **Alternative scenario:** Breakout and consolidation below the level of
1857.99 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of
1832.77 – 1793.84.

 **Analysis:** Supposedly, the ascending third wave of larger degree (3)
continues developing on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame, with wave 5 of (3) forming
inside. Apparently, the third wave of smaller degree  iii of 5 is
forming on the H4 time frame, with wave (v) of iii forming inside. The
third wave iii of (v) of iii has formed on the H1 time frame.  If this
assumption is correct, the price will continue to grow to 1915.00 –
1930.00 once correction iv of (v) of iii has formed. The level of
1857.99 is critical in this scenario as the breakout will enable the
pair to continue declining to the levels of 1832.77 – 1793.84.
