Analysis for oil, gold, and EUR/USD for 03.08.2020Alex Rodionov

##  **Oil price forecast** **for** **today:** ** **USCrude****
******analysis**

In the longer timeframe, the oil price is being corrected. The
correction has started from Target Zone 5 [41.67 – 40.92]. The target of
the down move is the trend key support Target Zone [35.54 - 34.86]. When
the key support is tested, I recommend entering purchases according to
the pattern.

Oil is being corrected in the shorter timeframe. Last week, the price
tested the key support of the local uptrend [38.94 – 38.60]. Buyers
reacted and the price rose a little. The price growth, however, was
stopped in the resistance zone [40.34 – 40.19].

Today, I recommend entering sell trades with the target to break through
the local low of last week. Enter short trades according to the pattern
in AZ [40.34 – 40.19].

It will be relevant to buy in the trend is there is a buy pattern, for
example, a false breakout.

##  **Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis**

Gold is trading in the medium-term uptrend with the target in Target
Zone 9 [1997.2 – 1991.2]. The trend key support is now in [1903.0 –
1894.8]. I recommend entering new long trades in the trend key support
zone according to the pattern.

The gold short-term trend is up. The upside target is Target Zone
[1997.1 – 1988.9]. Bulls have almost reached the target so far.

I recommend buying gold on the correction to the strong support zones,
Additional Zone [1964.5 - 1962.5] and Intermediary Zone [1944.0 –
1940.0]. The entry point can be found using a pattern.

When TZ is reached, there could start a deep correction for the gold
price.

##  **Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis**

Last week, the EUR/USD reached Target Zone 4 [1.1914 - 1.1896]. The
price is being corrected, but the middle-term trend remains up.
Correction is an opportunity to enter new purchases according to the
pattern with the target to break through the high of last week.

![LiteForex: Analysis for oil, gold, and EUR/USD for 03.08.2020][7]

The short-term timeframe indicates that the EUR/USD short-term trend has
turned down. It is relevant to sell with the downside target in the
lower Target Zone [1.1726 – 1.1708].

I recommend selling the euro on the correction from the zones of good
sell prices [1.1808 – 1.1817]. One can set a limit order in the middle
of the zone.

If bulls break through the resistance zone indicated above, we shall
again look for buy trades, as the trend will be up in this case.

![LiteForex: Analysis for oil, gold, and EUR/USD for 03.08.2020][8]

###  **[EURUSD][9] Trading ideas for today:**

Sell in the zone of [1.1808 - 1.1817]. TakeProfit: Target Zone [1.1726 -
1.1708]. StopLoss: 1.1864.

> IZ - Intermediary Zone: responsible for the price momentum reversing

>

> TZ - Target Zone: a zone that is 75% likely to be reached after IZ
breakout.

>

> GZ - Gold Zone: zone in the medium-term momentum.

>

> All zones are calculated based on the average [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) price of the
instrument and margin requirements of the futures.
