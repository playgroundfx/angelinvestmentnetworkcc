to be finishing now. It is composed of the sub-waves
[1]-[2]-[3]-[4]-[5], where correction [4] is a strong horizontal

standard zigzag A-B-C. The bullish impulse wave A, composed of five sub-
waves, completed, as well as the down corrective wave B. There is now
developing the middle-part of the final impulse C. Over the next few

completed the sub-waves [W]-[X]-[Y] of the global bearish zigzag. The
