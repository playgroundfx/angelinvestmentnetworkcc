TOP 5 strategies. Expectations and reality. Forecast as of
01.04.2021Dmitri Demidenko

Since the end of 2020, the situation in the global financial markets has
changed significantly. The slow vaccination process and high pandemic
rates in Europe have weakened the euro and related currencies. The
explosive growth in US Treasury yields has undermined the position of
emerging market currencies. At the same time, US stock indices continue
to fluctuate near historic highs. It seems that [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s sitting on a
mountain of cash have not lost their risk appetite. The change of
conditions suggests that the strategies that were relevant at the end of
last year could have been unprofitable. Is it so? Let's check it using
the TOP-5 strategies for 2021, which I published [at the end of
December][1].

The article covers the following subjects:

## Eastern European currencies

In January-March, the Czech koruna fell by 3.7%, the Hungarian forint -
by 3.9%. The Polish zloty dropped to the lowest level against the US
dollar since 2009, having lost about 5.9% of its value over the quarter.
This is due to the third wave of COVID-19 in Europe and the flight of
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s from the assets of emerging market countries against the
backdrop of a rapid rally in Treasury yields. The number of infections
per capita in Eastern Europe is the highest among all the coronavirus
waves, forcing governments to adhere to hard restrictions and banks and
investment companies to reduce their GDP forecasts.

I believe it is still relevant to hold the shorts on [USDCZK][2],
[USDPLN][3], and [USDHUF][4]. In the second-third quarter, due to the
acceleration of the vaccination process in the EU and the ratification
of the European Recovery fund, the situation may turn upside down.

## Platinum (+11%)

After a superb start, when the [XPTUSD][5] price reached $1339 per
ounce, the highest level since September 2014, platinum has slowed down.
Major producers from South Africa are ramping up production, and the
entire sector is under pressure due to a sell-off in the gold market. At
the same time, the precious metal showed resistance to the [EURUSD][6]
price fall. In my opinion, as soon as the EURUSD bulls are able to go
ahead, platinum will try to restore the uptrend. XPT's prospects are
still the most optimistic among the entire sector.

## Oil

In the first quarter, [Brent][7] prices rose by 22%, [WTI][8] - by 23%
due to expectations of rapid growth in global demand and the intention
of OPEC+ members to adhere to the previous strategy of limiting
production. Oil is the most effective instrument in my portfolio and has
a good chance of continuing the rally thanks to the positive stance of
Saudi Arabia. Riyadh does not intend to increase production until it is
sure that the pandemic is defeated.

Conflicts between the UK and the EU after Brexit arise systematically,
which restrains the growth of the pound and the UK stock indices.
Nevertheless, a rapid vaccination rate, a quick opening of the economy,
and high deferred demand can contribute to the rally of sterling and the
[FTSE 100][9]. It is not worth getting rid of these assets.

## [Boeing][10] stock (+19%)

The US company recently signed a contract for the supply of hundreds of
aircraft for Southwest Airlines. On March 28, the [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) pushed up Boeing
shares by 2.3%, which was the best gain among any company whose stocks
are included in the Dow Jones Index. In general, the stake on mass
vaccination, the explosive growth of the US economy, and the Americans'
thirst for travel are working out 100% and will most likely continue to
do so.

Thus, the weighted average return on a portfolio of 8 assets in January-
March was 8.3% in dollars over the quarter or more than 33% YoY. In
April-June, the Canadian dollar and the British pound can be added to
this list of assets.
