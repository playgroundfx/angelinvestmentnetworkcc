Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 01.04.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

The Ripple is more likely to be forming a triple zigzag than an ending
diagonal. The triple zigzag is about to finish soon.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

The BTCUSD continues rising in the upward impulse wave 5. Four sub-waves
of wave 5, corrective waves [2] and [4], and impulse motive waves [1]
and [3], must have completed. There is now forming the final sub-wave
[5], which could be a simple impulse. The market should be moving up to
level 65000.00. One could enter purchases in the current situation.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 59152.50, TP 65000.00

* * *

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

The previous chart layout has been changed. The Ripple market must be
developing the corrective wave B, namely, its final wave [Y] – which is
a triple zigzag (W)-(X)-(Y)-(X)-(Z). In the near future, the bullish
impulse wave C of a smaller degree should conclude the motive wave (Z)
at a level of around 0.645. Next, the market could turn down and start
declining in the bearish impulse wave C. Therefore, one could enter buy
trades with a target profit at level 0.645.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] today:

Buy 0.570, TP 0.645

* * *

## Elliott wave Ethereum analysis

The market continues rising. There is now developing the upward
corrective wave 5, composed of three sub-waves [a]-[b]-[c]. Wave 5 is
the last leg of the ending diagonal of a larger degree. There may have
completed impulse [a] and correction [b], so there should be unfolding
the bullish impulse wave [c]. The price could be rising to a level of
2080.00. It is relevant to open buy positions.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Buy 1923.40, TP 2080.00
