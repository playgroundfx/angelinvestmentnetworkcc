Dollar is in a blaze of glory. Won’t it burn? Forecast as of
01.04.2021Dmitri Demidenko

Forex changes so fast that the USD rally may not continue, despite its
impressive growth earlier. Will the euro challenge the powerful
greenback? Let us discuss the Forex outlook and make up a [EURUSD][1]
trading plan.

## Quarterly US dollar fundamental forecast

The US Treasuries rally has become the primary growth driver for the US
dollar, which has featured the best quarterly rise over the past few
years. According to Barclays research, Treasuries faced the worst sell-
off since 1980, which spiked yields and dramatically increased the
demand for US assets. By comparison, yields on European and Asian bonds
fell at the same rate as in 2019 and 2020, respectively.

Rapid vaccinations, massive stimulus, and the associated confidence in
the U.S. economy picking up to its best growth rate since 1983 have
boosted 10-year Treasury yields from 0.91% to 1.74%. According to Morgan
Stanley, Japanese [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s were the first to start selling US
government bonds. The bank noted the increased activity of sellers at
the Asian session at the end of February, at Asian and European sessions
in early March. At the same time, according to the Japanese Ministry of
Finance, the net profits of local [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s from the sale of foreign
bonds from early February to March 20 amounted to $25.5 billion.

Therefore, Japan contributed to the 4% [EURUSD][1] drop since the
beginning of the year. The matter is if the euro downtrend is about to
stop or the worst is yet to come.

Joe Biden announced a new $2.3 trillion fiscal stimulus package that is
planned to expand in April to bring the total additional aid to $3-$4
trillion. In theory, this should further accelerate economic growth.
However, the inflation rise, the increase in the debt servicing costs
and taxes will lead to the fact that the recovery after the 2020
recession will be much shorter than after the previous crisis. It can
well end by the middle of this decade.

The long-term dollar outlook is not as positive as the short-term, and
the euro could start rising in the next six months. Meanwhile, the ECB
continues to repeat the mantra that temporary factors caused the
inflation growth in Germany and the euro area in March. Christine
Lagarde says that financial markets can test the central bank's strength
for as long as necessary. The central bank has enough tools to clamp on
the yield growth, and it should retain the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) unchanged. However,
there is a growing split among the Governing Council's members.

The German population is aging and is saving more than spending. The
negative interest rates hit the economy. As vaccination progresses and
the lockdowns are lifted, the euro-area bond yield growth will become an
objective reality. Furthermore, the euro-area bond yields could be
growing faster than the US yields. If so, the euro will be supported.

### Quarterly [EURUSD][1] trading plan

I believe the [EURUSD][1] trend should reverse in April or May. Many
bearish drivers have already been priced, and positive [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) from Europe
will allow the euro to go up. It will be relevant to enter long- and
medium-term longs if the [EURUSD][1] goes back above the resistances at
1.185 and 1.193 or if the bears fail to break out the support zone of
1.158-1.164.
