Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

Yesterday, oil traders worked out a corrective sell pattern, driving the
price to Intermediary Zone 59.68 - 59.42.

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

Yesterday, oil traders worked out a corrective sell pattern, driving the
price to Intermediary Zone 59.68 - 59.42. This zone is the border of the
short-term uptrend. A reaction from it can be observed - a price is
rising and approaching the resistance zone 60.35 - 60.14.

Today, it is relevant to trade in the range between the new Additional
Zone and the trend border. For purchases, the formation of a reversal
pattern with the breaking out of the resistance at 60.35 is required. In
this case, the trend will continue, and the price will move towards
Target Zone 62.84 - 62.33.

The closing of the US trading session below level 59.42 is required for
sales. In this case, a trend will reverse down.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

Open sell positions according to the pattern in 60.35 - 60.14.
TakeProfit: 59.15. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

A new gold upward impulse started yesterday and continues now. The price
did not manage to reach the lower Target Zone 1655-1645 but instead
reversed and broke out the resistance 1705-1702. The US trading session
closed the price above level 1705. This suggests that the short-term
trend has changed to buy, and the target for purchases is now the Target
Zone 1732 - 1727.

Today it is profitable to look for long trades on the correction. Strong
supports from which it is profitable to enter trades are Additional Zone
1705 - 1703 and Intermediary Zone 1692 - 1690.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

  1. Buy in Additional Zone 1705 - 1703. TakeProfit: 1727. StopLoss: 1699. 

  2. Buy according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 1692 - 1690. TakeProfit: 1727. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

The euro is trading in a short-term downtrend with the target in the
Target Zone 2 1.1670 - 1.1654. Yesterday a correction and a test of the
Additional Zone 1.1748 - 1.1744 occurred. The price didn't break out the
zone. A sell pattern was formed.

Now the price is testing the mirror level 1.1725. It is possible to
enter short trades in the resistance level 1.1745, which is situated
above. Set a take profit at the level of 1.1707.

For euro purchasing, a breakout of level 1.1752 and price consolidation
higher during one trading session are required. In this case, the price
will go into a deep correction to test the trend border 1.1792 - 1.1784.

Sell around level 1.1745. TakeProfit: 1.1707. StopLoss: 1.1759.
