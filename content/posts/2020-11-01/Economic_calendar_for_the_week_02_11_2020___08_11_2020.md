Economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the week 02.11.2020 – 08.11.2020Jana Kane

##  **Review of the main events of the Forex economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the
next trading week (02.11.2020 – 08.11.2020)**

 **Trading on key Forex [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/): next week we expect the publication of
important macro statistics from the US, New Zealand, Australia,
Eurozone, Canada, as well as the results of the presidential elections
in the US and meetings of the central banks of Australia, Great Britain,
and the US.**

The dollar, which is in demand as a defensive asset, strengthened last
week, while US stock indices fell sharply. The DXY dollar index rose
1.3%, mainly due to the weakening of the euro, which accounts for about
57% of the DXY index.

The euro and pound remain under pressure from a sharp increase in the
number of coronavirus cases in Europe and the UK, which could result in
the introduction of new strict quarantine measures that restrict
economic activity. The pound is also affected by the Brexit situation,
and the representatives of the EU and the UK have not yet managed to
make progress on the trade deal.

American stock indices, in turn, are under pressure from political
uncertainty in the United States.

The next week promises to be extremely volatile due to many important
events and the publication of important [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/). The focus of financial
market participants next week will certainly be on the US presidential
election.

Its outcome will have a huge impact on both the United States and other
countries with the world's largest economies. Donald Trump's victory
will mean maintaining the current trade [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), while Joe Biden is
likely to change the tone of trade relations. Biden's victory could also
mean a new injection of money into the economy, which will push the US
stock indices up again. This, in turn, will help weaken the dollar. The
Fed will continue to adhere to its extra soft [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), and if Biden wins,
dollar sales are likely to increase.

In addition, next week, three of the world's largest central banks (Bank
of England, Bank of Australia and the Federal Reserve) will hold their
regular meetings and decide on the interest rate. Economists expect
central bank governors in Australia and the UK to make changes to the
banks' current monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) aimed at further easing it. Unexpected
decisions are not off the table, which will cause an additional increase
in volatility in the financial markets, and above all in the quotes of
the pound, Australian and American dollars.

Investors will also pay attention to the publication of important macro
statistics from the US, New Zealand, Australia, Eurozone, Canada, and,
above all, the publication of the monthly data from the US labor market,
which is scheduled, as always, on the first Friday of the month.

It's also important to note that on November 1 (Sunday), the United
States will turn the clocks back 1 hour.

 **Traders should pay attention to the publication of the following
macro indicators:**

 ***during the coming week, new events may be added to the [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) and
/ or some scheduled events may be canceled**

 ****** **GMT time**

###  **Monday, November 2**

###  **15:00** **USD ISM Manufacturing PMI**

The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) Manufacturing PMI is an
important indicator of the health of the American economy as a whole. A
result above 50 is seen as positive and strengthens the USD, one below
50 as negative for the US dollar. Forecast: 55.6 in October (against
55.4 in September, 56.0 in August, 54.2 in July, 43.1 in May, 41.5 in
April, 49.1 in March, 50.1 in February ). The index value is above 50
and not below the previous value, which can support the dollar in the
short term. The data above 50 indicates an acceleration of activity,
which has a positive effect on the quotes of the national currency. If
the indicator drops below the forecast and the value of 50, the dollar
may drop sharply.

###  **Tuesday, November 3**

###  **03:30 AUD RBA's decision on interest rate. RBA's accompanying
statement**

In March, the RBA made 2 rate cuts, bringing it to the current level of
0.25%, and launched a quantitative easing program. At the same time, the
target level of yield is set at 0.25% for 3-year government bonds of
Australia. The RBA has launched a program of lending to the banking
system in the amount of at least A$90 billion and intends to buy bonds
for A$5 billion.

The negative forecasts of economists suggest that the Australian economy
will contract by 6% in 2020, which will be the sharpest annual GDP
contraction since the Great Depression of the 1920s. The unemployment
rate is likely to rise to around 8.5%.

Some economists have talked about Australia entering its first recession
in nearly 30 years, which could turn into a depression.

“We live in extraordinary and difficult times,” said central bank
governor Philip Lowe. In his opinion, "further stimulation is needed."
He announced this during a press conference on March 19, when the RBA
cut the interest rate during its unscheduled meeting.

Philip Lowe has repeatedly stated earlier that the central bank is ready
to lower the rate again if necessary, although the likelihood of
introducing negative rates, in his opinion, is "extremely small."

The main negative factors for the Australian economy are weak wages
growth, a weak labor market and a slowdown in growth. Annual inflation
has remained below the RBA's target range of 2-3% for nearly four years.

Unemployment in the country remains above the 5% level for many years,
unwilling to decline. Now the coronavirus pandemic has been added to the
above negative factors, which has hit the tourism and transport sectors.
The RBA also expresses concerns that unemployment may rise to 8%, or
even 10%.

It is expected that at this meeting the Central Bank of Australia will
lower the rate from the current 0.25% to a new record low of 0.1%, as
well as extend the asset purchase program to 5-10-year government bonds.
Philip Lowe announced the possibility of such a decision earlier in
October, noting also "the need for further fiscal support" from the
state.

In an accompanying statement, the RBA executives will explain the
reasons for the rate decision. If the RBA signals the possibility of
further easing of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) in the near future, the risks of a
further fall in the Australian dollar will increase.

###  **13:00 USD The US presidential election**

The outcome of the US presidential election will have a huge impact on
both the US and other countries with the world's largest economies.
Donald Trump's victory will mean maintaining the current trade [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/),
while Joe Biden is likely to change the tone of trade relations. Biden's
victory could also mean a new injection of money into the economy, which
will push US stock indices up again. This, in turn, as well as the
continued extra soft [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the Fed, will contribute to the weakening
of the dollar. If Biden wins, dollar sales are likely to increase.

When trading during this period, remember that a sharp increase in
volatility and a decrease in liquidity are possible in financial
markets, accompanied by significant widening of spreads for brokers.

###  **21:45 NZD Employment rate. Unemployment rate (data for the 3rd
quarter)**

The employment rate reflects the quarterly change in the number of
employed New Zealand citizens. The growth of the indicator has a
positive impact on consumer spending, which stimulates economic growth.
A high value is positive for the NZD, while a low value is negative.
Forecast: In the 3rd quarter, the number of employed citizens of New
Zealand decreased, and the employment rate fell by -0.8% (against an
increase of +0.7% in the 1st quarter of 2020 and a fall of -0.4% in 2
quarter).

Also at the same time, the Bureau of Statistics of New Zealand publishes
a report on the unemployment rate - the indicator that estimates the
ratio of the unemployed population to the total number of able-bodied
citizens. The growth of the indicator indicates the weakness of the
labor market, which leads to a weakening of the national economy. The
decline in the indicator is positive for the NZD. Forecast: Unemployment
in New Zealand in the third quarter rose to 5.4% from 4.2% in the first
quarter of 2020 and 4.0% in the second quarter.

Other indicators of the Bureau of Statistics report are also expected to
decline, which is likely to negatively affect the NZD. Worse-than-
expected data will have an even stronger negative impact on the NZD.

###  **23:50 JPY Bank of Japan Monetary Policy Committee meeting**

At this meeting, the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Japan will
once again summarize the results of the previous week's meeting of the
Bank, analyze the economic situation in Japan and give indications of
possible further prospects for the Bank of Japan's financial [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).

If the tone of the minutes of the meeting indicates the firmness of the
intentions of the Bank of Japan regarding monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) in the
country, it will negatively affect the Japanese stock market and
strengthen the yen. Conversely, soft rhetoric about the bank's monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) prospects will weaken the yen and boost the Japanese stock
market.

###  **Wednesday, November 4**

###  **00:30 AUD Retail Sales Index**

Retail Sales Index is published monthly by the Australian Bureau of
Statistics and measures total retail sales. The index is often
considered an indicator of consumer confidence and reflects the health
of the retail sector in the near term. A rise in the index is usually
positive for the AUD; a decrease in the indicator will negatively affect
the AUD. The previous value of the index (in September) was -1.5% after
falling by -17.7% in April. If the data for October turns out to be
weaker than the previous value, the AUD may sharply decline in the short
term.

###  **13:15 USD ADP**   **National**   **Employment Report**

The ADP National Employment Report usually has a strong impact on the
market and dollar quotes. An increase in the value of this indicator has
a positive effect on the dollar. It is expected that the growth in the
number of workers in the private sector in the United States in October
was 526,000 (against +749,000 in September). The growth of the indicator
should have a positive effect on the dollar quotes.

Therefore, the market reaction may be positive, and the dollar will
strengthen if the data is confirmed or turns out to be better than the
forecast.

Millions of Americans have previously been laid off due to the
coronavirus pandemic and related quarantine measures. The bulk of the
layoffs were concentrated in tourism and retail. Other important sectors
of the economy were also affected. ADP previously reported that the most
significant drop in employment was recently observed in the construction
and financial services sectors.

While the ADP report does not directly correlate with the official US
Labor Department data due Friday, it may fall short of forecasts,
pointing to a decline in non-farm jobs instead of an expected 0.700
million new job growth.

If the forecast (+0.700 million new jobs) from the US Department of
Labor does not come true, it will indicate a reversal of the current
trend in the rate of hiring, while millions of Americans have lost the
previously increased unemployment benefits.

###  **15:00 USD ISM Services PMI**

This indicator assesses the state of the services sector in the US
economy. These services sectors (as opposed to the manufacturing sector)
have practically no impact on the country's GDP.

In September, this indicator came out with a value of 57.8. A result
above 50 is seen as positive for the USD. However, a relative decline in
the index could negatively affect the dollar in the short term. Outlook
for October: 57.8, which is likely to have a positive overall effect on
the USD.

###  **Thursday, November 5**

###  **00:30 AUD Balance of trade**

This indicator measures the relationship between Australia's export and
import volumes. Growth in exports from Australia leads to an increase in
the trade surplus, which has a positive impact on the AUD. Previous
value (August) A$2.643 billion. A decrease in the trade surplus may
negatively affect the Australian dollar. The preliminary estimate for
September assumed the growth of the trade surplus to A$5.114 billion,
which is a positive factor for the AUD.

###  **10:00 EUR Retail sales in the Eurozone**

Retail sales is a major consumer spending indicator that shows the
change in retail sales. A high result strengthens the euro, and vice
versa, a low result weakens it. Forecast for September: -1.2% and +2.8%
(in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) against +4.4% (+3.7% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) in August. The
data suggests that retail sales have yet to reach pre-coronavirus levels
after a sharp drop in March-April, when tough quarantine measures were
in place in Europe.

###  **12:00 GBP Bank of England's decision on interest rate. Bank of
England's meeting minutes. Planned volume of asset purchases by the Bank
of England. Monetary Policy Report**

In March (11 March and 19 March), during its extraordinary meetings, the
Bank of England cut its interest rate twice, bringing it to the level of
0.1%, and announced its intention to purchase UK government bonds in the
amount of 200 billion British pounds, in an attempt to counteract
economic damage from the coronavirus pandemic. The central bank
announced that it would increase its bond portfolio to £645bn, then to
£745bn from £445bn at the time. "The current situation is completely
unprecedented," said the new Governor of the Bank of England Andrew
Bailey at the press conference after the emergency meeting on March 19.
Bailey said he expected a sharp economic contraction due to the
coronavirus, and the Bank of England stands ready to take further
stimulus measures if necessary. “No, we're not done yet,” he said. Based
on these statements by Andrew Bailey, it is fair to expect further
actions from the Bank of England towards easing its monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). It
is not impossible that at this meeting on November 5, the Bank of
England will increase the volume of bond purchases to 845 billion pounds
or lower the interest rate. Although, most economists believe that the
Bank of England will refrain from lowering the interest rate for now.

Also at this time, the minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of
the Bank of England are published with the distribution of votes "for"
and "against" raising / lowering the interest rate. The main risks for
the UK after Brexit are associated with expectations of a slowdown in
the country's economic growth, as well as with a large current account
deficit in the UK balance of payments.

The intrigue about further actions of the Bank of England remains. And
in trading the pound and the FTSE100 index, a lot of trading
opportunities will be there during the period of publication of the
bank's decision on rates.

Also at the same time, the Bank of England's report on monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
will be published, containing an assessment of the economic outlook. At
this time, the volatility in the pound quotes may rise sharply. One of
the main benchmarks for the Bank of England regarding the prospects for
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) in the UK, in addition to GDP, is the inflation rate. If
the tone of the report is soft, the British stock market will gain
support and the pound will decline. Conversely, the report's tough
rhetoric on curbing inflation, implying an increase in interest rates in
the UK, will strengthen the pound.

###  **12:30 GBP Speech by the Governor of the Bank of England Andrew
Bailey**

In his speech, Andrew Bailey, who took over as Governor of the Bank of
England on March 16, 2020, replacing Mark Carney, will clarify the
bank's decision on monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). It is likely that he will also touch
on the state and prospects of the British economy, which has been badly
affected by the coronavirus pandemic and is on the verge of Brexit,
which can still go according to the hard scenario.

Participants of financial markets will also expect him to clarify the
situation regarding the further [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the UK central bank. If Andrew
Bailey gives any hints about tightening or easing of the Bank of
England's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) in the near future, volatility during his
speech will sharply increase in the quotes of the pound and the London
Stock Exchange FTSE index. If he does not touch upon the issues of
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), the reaction to his speech will be weak.

###  **19:00 USD The Fed's decision on interest rate. The Fed's comments
on monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)**

Following two meetings in March, the Fed sharply cut its interest rate
(to 0.25% from 1.75% in February), and also announced the allocation of
$700 billion for the purchase of US government bonds and mortgage-backed
securities. Subsequently, the Fed has repeatedly announced additional
measures to support the American economy and inject cheap liquidity into
the financial system. Usually, with the easing of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), the
national currency becomes cheaper and its quotations go down.

In recent months, the dollar has been declining as [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s withdrew
funds from defensive assets, buying more risky and profitable assets of
the stock market, which continued to grow despite the threat of a second
wave of the coronavirus epidemic and the associated economic slowdown.
The role of the dollar as a defensive asset was also declining. However,
since the beginning of August, the dollar index has been trading in a
range, while the US stock market continues to swing in different
directions. And again, the role of the dollar as a defensive asset has
been growing lately.

The rate is widely expected to remain at 0.25% at this meeting. At the
end of May, the US Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said that he
was "satisfied with the current situation and the path we (at the Fed)
are now heading." "We are not close to any of our limits," - said
Powell, making it clear that the Fed intends to continue to support the
economy. Other Fed leaders have also repeatedly stated that they are in
favor of continuing the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of supporting the American economy.

Nevertheless, during the period of publication of the decision on the
rate, volatility may sharply increase throughout the financial market,
primarily in the American stock market and in the dollar quotes,
especially if the decision on the rate differs from the forecast or
unexpected statements are received from the Fed leaders.

Powell's comments may affect both short-term and long-term USD trading.
A more hawkish stance on the Fed's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) is seen as positive
and strengthens the US dollar, while a more cautious position is seen as
negative for the USD. Any hints of the possibility of raising the
interest rate will cause the dollar to strengthen and the American stock
markets to fall.

Investors want to hear the plans of the Fed for this and next year.

###  **19:30 USD FOMC press conference**

The press conference of the US Federal Open Market Committee lasts about
an hour. The first part reads the ruling, followed by a series of
questions and answers that can increase market volatility.

Powell's comments may affect both short-term and long-term USD trading.
A more hawkish stance on the Fed's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) is seen as positive
and strengthens the US dollar, while a more cautious position is seen as
negative for the USD. Any hints of the possibility of a change in the
current monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) will cause an increase in volatility in the
dollar quotes and in the American stock market.

###  **Friday, November 6**

###  **00:30 AUD RBA's comments on monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)**

The Monetary Policy Commentary provides an overview of economic and
financial conditions and an assessment of risks to financial stability
and sustainable economic growth. The overview a kind of guideline for
defining the RBA's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) plans. A tougher stance on the RBA's
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) is seen as positive and strengthens the Australian
dollar, while a more cautious stance is seen as negative for the AUD.

###  **13:30 USD Average hourly wages. Non-Farm Payrolls. Unemployment
rate**

The most important indicators of the state of the labor market in the
United States in October. Forecast: +0.2% (against +0.1% in September,
-1.2% in June, -1.0% in May, +4.7% in April) / +0.700 million (against
+0.661 million in September, +1.763 million in July and -20.687 million
in April) / 7.7% (against 7.9% in September, 13.3% in May and 14.7% in
April), respectively.

In general, the indicators cannot yet be described as positive, but they
are quite understandable due to mass layoffs in American companies and
the closings of offices and shops due to the coronavirus pandemic. At
the same time, the data indicate a gradual improvement in the US labor
market after its collapse in previous months at the beginning of the
year. Prior to the coronavirus, the US labor market remained strong,
signaling the stability of the American economy and supporting the
dollar.

It is often difficult to predict the market reaction to the publication
of indicators. many indicators for previous periods are subject to
revision. Now it will be even more difficult to do this, because the
economic situation in many other large economies is no better. In any
case, when data from the US labor market is published, a surge in
volatility is expected in trading not only in the USD, but throughout
the entire financial market. Probably the most cautious [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s will
choose to stay out of the market during this time frame.

###  **13:30 CAD Unemployment rate in Canada**

Statistics Canada is to publish data on the country's labor market for
October.

Unemployment has risen in Canada in recent months, including amid
massive business closures due to coronavirus and layoffs. Unemployment
rose from the usual 5.6% - 5.7% to 7.8% in March and to 13.7% in May. If
unemployment continues to rise, the Canadian dollar will decline. If the
data is better than the previous value, the Canadian dollar will
strengthen. A decrease in the unemployment rate is a positive factor for
the CAD, an increase in unemployment is a negative factor. It is
expected that in October unemployment was at 9.7% (after 9.0%, 10.2%,
10.9%, 12.3%, 13.7%, 13.0% in the previous months).

###  **14:00 CAD Speech by the Governor of the Bank of Canada Tiff
Macklem**

Tiff Macklem took over as Governor of the Bank of Canada after Stephen
Poloz, becoming Chairman on June 3, 2020. Macklem faces essentially the
same tasks as his predecessor in this post.

The Canadian economy, as well as the entire global economy, is showing
signs of a slowdown in the first half of this year, driven by the
downturn in business due to the coronavirus pandemic. Earlier this year,
Stephen Poloz said that the Canadian economy is robust enough to keep
rates unchanged despite the worsening global economy. However, the
situation is changing rapidly, and not for the better. It will be
interesting now to hear Maclem's opinion on the sustainability of the
Canadian economy and the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the central bank.

If Tiff Macklem touches on the topic of the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the Bank
of Canada, the volatility in the quotes of the Canadian dollar will rise
sharply. His tough tone will help strengthen the Canadian dollar. The
soft rhetoric of Macklem's speech and the intention to pursue soft
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) will negatively affect the CAD quotes.

Probably, he can also provide some guidelines for [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s on the eve
of the next meeting of the Bank of Canada, which will be held on
December 9.
