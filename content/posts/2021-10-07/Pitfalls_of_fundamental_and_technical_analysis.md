Pitfalls of fundamental and technical analysisOleg Tkachenko

## Peculiarities of fundamental and technical analysis in Forex: traps,
errors of beginner traders; [how to](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-trading-how-to/) avoid trading mistakes.

Many newbies may think that fundamental analysis is a simple tool to
earn easy money: you just need to wait for good [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) and enter a trade
in the trend direction. They are much disappointed when the price
reverses in the opposite direction. Something like this happens to the
fans of technical analysis. The main reason is underestimating of
complexity of these types of analysis. You will learn from this review
about pitfalls of fundamental and technical analysis as well as [how to](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-trading-how-to/)
avoid common mistakes. At the end of the article you’ll find some useful
for trading links!

## The dangers of fundamental and technical analysis

Fundamental analysis is the most appealing for novice traders. It is
logical. You don’t have to study the special features of indicators, if
you can earn, for example, on the publication of positive statistics,
reporting, or invest in top companies like Alphabet, Apple – their
stocks grow in price anyway. What a surprise it is when the price goes
in the opposite direction or swings up and down triggering stop losses.
At this moment, they suspect that the broker falters with quotes. Alas,
it is human nature to blame anyone for mistakes, but not yourself.
Although the case is mainly in the trader, who did not take into account
any factors.

The same is with technical analysis. False signals from indicators are
charged to the fact that the quotes are late or the broker is again to
blame. For some reason, the fundamental factor is not taken into
account. This review will briefly describe the traps of fundamental and
technical analysis, which for some reason are not taken into account by
[beginners](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-for-beginners/). Advanced [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s know all of this, so, first of all, the
article will be useful for newbies. Easy money does not come!

## Traps of fundamental analysis

Fundamental analysis can be roughly divided into three parts:

  * Analysis of geopolitical and macroeconomic factors: GDP and labor market, monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the Central Bank (discount rate, control of the money supply, etc.), statistics, balance of payments, trade relations, emergency events, including local military conflicts.
  * Analysis of individual industries: growth dynamics in percentage [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/), outlook, level of demand, etc.
  * Analysis of individual companies: financial performance.

### 1\. Failed expectations

Here, the most appropriate example is the stock market. One of the
common strategies of to make profits on the stocks is to enter a trade
at the time of publication of statistical data: financial statements,
results of work done (for example, biotech companies are particularly
sensitive to the failure of medical research tests), expansion to local
markets, etc. It sounds reasonable "Positive financial statements -
rising stock value." It is a common mistake of novice traders who forget
that any statistics is viewed in dynamics.

This chart shows two major price drops, which turned out to be the
deepest since 2012. March 16, Facebook's stock price fell by 6.8%. The
reason was information that the personal data of 51.3 million social
network users were stolen, published in the media.

>  _Note. This is a good example of how the price reacts to all sorts of
positive and negative comments. A sharp crash in prices suggests that
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are massively selling Facebook stocks. And now pay attention
to how much you could earn by buying stocks when the price was reaching
the low: within 4 months, the price rose from $ 153.03 to $ 217.5. An
excellent proof that you should never panic: do not sell during the
price fall, buy at the very low._

But we are interested in the second price drop. Pay attention to how
vertical and fast it is. On Wednesday, July 25, Facebook stocks dropped
by 24% immediately after the main trading sessions in the US closed. The
reason is the publication of financial reporting:

  * The company revenues for the quarter increased according to the report to $13.2 billion, although it had been expected to grow to $13.3 billion;
  * The growth rate of the monthly audience for Q2 was at 1.54%, compared to 3.14% in the first quarter.
  * The number of [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) active users was +1.44% in Q2, compared to +3.42% in the first quarter.
  * The number of users in Europe decreased to 376 million from 377, it was without any changes in the North America (241 million of people).

As you see the company’s financial performance in the second quarter was
positive: there is a growth, the revenue increased. But, compared to the
previous quarter, it was less, which resulted in that strong price fall.

 **How to avoid the trap:**

  * Analyze financial statistics for several periods, comparing it with the expected data (for stock markets). Assess industry reports for several periods.
  * Monitor analytics and forums. But be careful, as manipulations are also possible.
  * Diversify risks. Errors are inevitable and profits must cover the losses. It makes sense to invest in directly correlated assets.

I also want to mention such a phenomenon as Ex-dividend. It occurs on
dividends on stocks are to be paid. It would seem that on the eve of the
payment you can buy more shares, receive dividends and immediately sell
them. Greedy [beginners](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-for-beginners/) often fall into this trap.

Dividends are paid to the shareholders. Dividend payment is agreed at
the shareholders' meeting, where the corresponding register is formed
and the date of payment is determined (the so-called cut-off date for
holders). Everyone who is a security owner on the next morning after the
cut-off date receives dividends. Ex-dividend describes a stock that is
trading without the value of the next dividend payment. The ex-dividend
date or "ex-date" is the day the stock starts trading without the value
of its next dividend payment. Ex-dividend describes a stock that drops
in price by an amount approximately equal to the dividend amount,
because they are paid at the expense of the company's profits. By the
way, you can’t enter a short trade (since you already know that the
stock price will fall by the amount of dividends), it is this is
prohibited, and the broker must forcibly close such a position.

Decide on your own if the Gazprom PAO share price drop is the ex-
dividend or just a coincidence.

### 2\. Underestimation of other factors

The Fed discount rate and report on the US employment are thought to be
one of the most influential factors for currency pairs that include the
US dollar. As well as a report on the US oil reserves, gasoline
stockpile and the number of shale oil drilling rigs. At first glance,
this could be an efficient strategy. For example, at the time of
positive reporting on the labor market is published one might open a
long position lasting about an hour. But this does not always work. Even
despite the growth in jobs number, it is necessary to analyze data on
unemployment, changes in average hourly wages, etc.

I will give another example: the EUR/USD exchange rate depends on not
only the US economic data, but on the ECB reports as well. If the first
data have been already anticipated by [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s and coincide with their
expectations and the ECB statistics turns out to be unexpected (doesn’t
match the forecasts), then the ECB statistics, thought to less
influential than the US economic reports, will outweigh and support the
EUR value.

 **How to avoid the trap:**

  * Assess everything in the complex, ranging from geopolitics and macroeconomic indicators, ending with industry data and statistics of a single company. Estimate the central bank policies in all the countries as well as economic statistics to trade In the foreign exchange market.
  * Analyze the industry state in general.
  * Do not hurry. If the price for some reason has gone in the opposite direction after the statistics release, you’d better close exit the trade and wait. On December 6, 2013, after the release of a very strong NFP report, the EUR / USD rate declined, but then the trend reversed. According to analysts, such a reaction to a strong positive report was the first time since 2000. Nobody knows why. It is possible that large [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s played against the market.

### 3\. Late response to an event

Suppose you are expecting an event: a change in the discount rate or a
financial report. You buy (sell) an asset, but ... Statistics is
published, and the asset price does not change and you lose money due to
margin. Why this happens: the matter is that many events are predictable
long before they occur. And more long-sighted traders buy an asset much
earlier. Analysts say like this: the price of the asset did not change,
since [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s had already “traded” the [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/).

 **How to avoid the trap:**

  * There is a single solution: learn to consider different scenarios in advance and keep the two above points in mind.

### 4\. Manipulations by means of the media

Where would you search for information about a particular event? Will
you study economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/), original sources or the media, forums,
analytics, expert opinions? Of course, there is little trust in experts
and the media, but when the same information is confirmed in different
sources, and it is also actively discussed in topical forums, you
unwittingly start believing the majority. But there is a reasonable
question: if, for example, everyone wants to buy an asset, then who will
sell it at a price rise? Market-makers? Or those who deliberately
created the right informational environment, encouraging potential
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s to take the needed decision?

There a few ways how the “trading sharks shear sheep”:

  * Manipulation with figures. The statistics is presented in a way to create a certain, needed by the manipulator, opinion about situation. Most often it is convenient to influence people’s opinion, indicating percentage points. Few people think from what the percentage and in comparison with what.
  * Creating fake accounts on the forums to make it look like chatting in order to introduce particular ideas in trader community.
  * Special "stuffing" of deliberately false [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/), ideas, opinions through their hired analysts.

 **How to avoid the trap:** read more about such manipulations and the
ways to protect you [here][1].

## Traps of technical analysis

Technical analysis is a try to make up a trading system, based on
indicators, like lines, dots and etc. that display entry points in the
chart. It also includes graphic analysis (psychological support and
resistance levels, Fibonacci retracement levels), candlestick analysis
and patterns (recognized candlestick patterns or formations) and so on.
The fans of technical analysis certainly overestimate its efficiency.



### 1.Force majeure and exception to market wave theory

Indicator is software, written in a programming language (for example,
MQL5 language). It is based on a mathematical principle built on
different systems statistical data analysis. According to the parameters
specified this program analyzes statistics for a specified time period
and, based on the pattern, assumes price action.

>  _Note. Remember 2006 and 2010. The statistics was broken by the 2008
mortgage crisis, and a trader who was entering the number of bars for
analysis would have seen completely opposite results for 2 years and 5
years. You can believe in the market wave theory like a religion, but
there can’t be perfectly still waves! By the way, remembering Brexit and
January 15, 2015, when the Swiss National Bank caused turmoil in the
market._

 __

No indicator can tell even 99% how the market will behave. Mathematical
algorithm can foresee psychology, manipulation and force majeure. Ask
the supporters of technical analysis: which oscillator is better and
why: stochastic, RSI, MACD? Or something else?

How to avoid the trap:

  * The single solution is to understand that there are no perfect indicators. And there no indicators that ideally work in all market situations. You’ll have to test them, analyze fundamental factors, be flexible and look for your own combinations of tools.

To cut it short, you need to develop your own most efficient
combination, be mentally flexible, patient and able to manage stress.

### 2\. Crowd instinct and slippages

Imagine that you could still find an ideal combination of technical
indicators. You could even order an [Expert Advisor][2]. It doesn’t
matter what principle it is based on, but you made it available in free
access. What do you think will happen if all traders will apply it
simultaneously? Or, simply put, if everybody, hypothetically, opens a
positions at the same direction simultaneously, following the Expert
Advisor signal? Let alone the one, on whose expense all these positions
would be provided. The result of missing counterparties to the
transaction is slippage.

Admit that the market will just behave in the same way despite the
signals of the indicator. That is why the hope that free (as well as
paid) strategies will be profitable can help you is false.

 **How to avoid the trap:**

  * “Free cheese is only found in the mousetrap”. In most cases, the strategies described on the [website](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/website-for-forex-trading/)s and presented as working ones are not so. The purpose is the same - to attract traffic to the site or convince a person to sign in via an affiliate link. But these strategies won’t do any harm either; they are a perfect simulator to train trading on a demo account. [Download indicator templates][3], install in MT4 and train yourself to adjust indicator setting by testing on the [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/).
  * “Paid cheese in the mousetrap seems to be tastier, but the essence is the same”. But the case is far more interesting. At first sight, paid strategies should be efficient since they aren’t in free access. But just think if it makes any sense to sell an efficient strategy you can make cash on PAMM accounts or [social trading ][4]. There are numerous examples of fake [backtest](https://www.fintechee.com/backtesting-a-portfolio/)ing, and hardly anybody knows about MyFxBook monitoring.
  * There is a single solution: use the basic and combined indicators, train to combine them with each other, develop the trading system yourself and correct it all the time (you will find information with a link on [how to](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-trading-how-to/) adjust trading systems in the final part).

Those, who know [how to](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-trading-how-to/) make more cash on trading and have a winning
trading strategy, will hardly share it.

### 3\. Market noise and lagging indicators

Market noise is random sideways price swings in the short-term
timeframes. The nature of the noise is difficult to explain: it may be
lagging quotes, flaws of the platform itself or the broker’s server
equipment, and entering small trades. The price will never draw a chart,
looking like a straight line. Unfortunately, market noise affects the
indicators getting them send false signals.

Indicator draws in the chart hypothetical price action in future, based
on the [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) of the previous periods. Each last bar can have a strong
influence on it, but, by the time the indicator will present the
information, including the last bar, there will have been already next
bar opened, which, influenced by fundamental factors, may be in the
opposite direction. That is a time lag.

 **How to avoid the trap:**

  * Operate in timeframes from M30 and longer
  * Analyze the price chart with different types of indicators. Don’t focus on the number of trades entered and on the profit. What matters is the accuracy and the minimum risk.
  * Avoid [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) errors, analyze the previous results objectively.
  * Analyze indicators and fundamental factors together.

And one more important rule: don’t be too carried away, you shouldn’t
change indicators and strategies every day to look for entries. Choose
one approach and get it to work!

 **Conclusion:** Neither fundamental, nor technical analysis will
guarantee successful trading. And of course, you shouldn’t count on only
one type of analysis alone. Successful trading involves the use of these
types of analysis in the complex, but even that is sometimes not enough.
A trader must also have insight, good reaction, resistance to stress (in
order not to lose money at the time of the panic) and remember that
institutional capital also controls the market. Yes, it is not easy to
make money on speculative price swings, but everything is possible if
you make efforts to this and don’t hope for easy money. In conclusion,
