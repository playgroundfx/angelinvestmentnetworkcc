Silver is in a tight corner. Forecast as of 07.10.2021Dmitri Demidenko

Silver, confidently outstripping gold in the first half of 2021,
collapsed by the end of the year. Why did it happen? Will the
[XAGUSD][1] bulls be able to fix something? Let us discuss the Forex
outlook and make up a trading plan.

## Quarterly silver fundamental forecast

Silver, which started well in 2021, is going to end the year with a
decline. The [XAGUSD][1] dynamics for the four months from June to
September turned out to be the worst since 2014. Amid expectations of
the Fed monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) normalization, prolonged stay of US inflation at
elevated levels, and a decrease in industrial demand, metal futures fell
by 25% from the February highs. It seems that this is not the limit.

Silver is both a precious and an industrial metal, which determines its
dynamics. The ultra-easy monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the world's leading central
banks contributed to an increase in both investment demand and
[XAGUSD][1] price. In March 2020, at the peak of the panic in the
financial markets, the Fed created money to buy assets at $75 billion
per day. Around the same time, the ECB announced an emergency program
for €1.85 trillion, which is equivalent to $2.15 trillion. It is not
surprising that with such crazy volumes of liquidity, all indicators
have increased!

The European and US central banks are currently buying aggregate assets
of about $235 billion a month, and both intend to reduce their activity
in the debt market. Their plans assume that the volume of purchases of
bonds will fall by an average of $20 billion. The pace is significantly
faster than in 2013-2014, when the Fed was getting rid of monetary
stimulus at a rate of $8.5 billion, and the ECB, on the contrary, bought
them for $3.9 billion per month. It is not surprising that the yield on
US Treasury bonds is now growing so rapidly, contributing to the fall of
precious metals prices. Hedge funds have cut silver net longs to their
lowest level since June 2019.

### Dynamics of speculative positions and prices for silver



 _Source: Wall Street Journal._

In the first half of 2021, impressive growth in manufacturing activity
supported the [XAGUSD][1] bulls. Now everything is turned upside down.
Supply disruptions, high prices, recruitment difficulties and an energy
crisis are slowing down global production and industrial demand for
silver. According to Jerome Powell, supply chain difficulties will
continue in 2022, which does not rule out a longer period of high
inflation than the Fed anticipated.

What is currently happening in the global economy increasingly resembles
the supply shocks of the 1970s and threatens with stagflation. If,
because of this, the Fed refuses to normalize monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), precious
metals may rise from the ashes. However, in my opinion, such a scenario
is unlikely. In contrast to the energy crisis in Europe, the US economy
is poised to accelerate in the fourth quarter. Divergence in GDP growth
rates will play into the hands of the greenback and spoil the mood of
the [XAGUSD][1] bulls.

### Quarterly silver trading plan

Thus, the medium and long-term outlook for silver looks bearish. This
assumes the development of a downtrend in the direction of $20.7 and
$19.6 per ounce. A strong US jobs report for September may become a
reason to enter sales. On the contrary, the weak report will exacerbate
the correction risks to $23.6 and $24.2, the rebound from which will
allow entering short trades.
