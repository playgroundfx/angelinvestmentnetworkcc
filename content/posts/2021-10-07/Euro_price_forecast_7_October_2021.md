Euro is in crisis. Forecast as of 07.10.2021Dmitri Demidenko

While in the second or third quarters of the year the eurozone economy
expanded faster than the American one, in the fourth quarter everything
may turn upside down. The record-high gas prices are to blame. Let's
discuss this and make up a trading plan for [EURUSD][1].

## Monthly Euro fundamental forecast

There is a version that God created economists so that meteorologists
did not look too bad. Anyway, economic forecasts have recently become
very dependent on the weather. The colder the winter in the Northern
Hemisphere, the higher gas prices will rise, and the faster stagflation
will come to the regions, the energy sectors of which are tied to this
type of fuel. For example, the eurozone. The combination of high
inflation and too slow GDP growth scares away [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s from the euro
like garlic scares vampires, suggesting that the fast start of the Fed's
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) normalization and high demand for safe-haven assets are
not the only drivers of the EURUSD downtrend.

While the US Congress is drowning in the problems of the national debt
ceiling, an energy crisis is sweeping across Europe. In order to figure
out what is really going on there, you need to go back 10 years. Then,
frightened by the tragedy in Fukushima, the government of Angela Merkel
decided to get rid of nuclear energy and switch to wind and gas energy
instead. According to the plan, the transformation was to be completed
by 2022. Indeed, over the past decade, the structure of energy
consumption has changed significantly.

Berlin is now significantly more dependent on gas than in 2012, and the
rise in prices for this raw material to record highs can cause no less
serious damage to the eurozone economy than Britain's Brexit or the
shutdown of the US government. One should expect both a further
acceleration of European inflation in the near future and a slowdown in
GDP growth in the eurozone. According to Nordea Markets, the energy
crisis will deduct about 1.5-2 percentage points from the GDP in 2022,
as a result of which the eurozone economy will be significantly
outperformed by the American economy. Isn't it an argument to enter
shorts on [EURUSD][1]?

into account

The negative impact of record-high gas prices on GDP will manifest
itself both through net exports since Europe is a net buyer of this raw
material and through reducing the consumption of other assets because of
higher electricity prices.

Just like Britain is at risk of stagflation due to Brexit, supply chain
disruptions, employment problems, the eurozone is also ready to plunge
into it. Meanwhile, the States are reaping the benefits of an improved
epidemiological situation: a decrease in the number of people infected
with COVID-19 has led to an acceleration in the growth of employment in
the private sector from +349 thousand to +568 thousand in September,
according to ADP. If the same happens with non-farm payrolls, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s
will have the right to expect not only the beginning of cessation of
$120 billion QE in November but also an acceleration of US GDP in the
fourth quarter.

### [EURUSD][2] trading plan for the month

Thus, along with the divergence in the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the Fed and
the ECB, EURUSD quotes go south due to the potential divergence in the
economic growth of the States and the eurozone. Selling the pair at
pullbacks justifies itself, why not keep going with this strategy? The
new targets for shorts are 1.145 and 1.133.
