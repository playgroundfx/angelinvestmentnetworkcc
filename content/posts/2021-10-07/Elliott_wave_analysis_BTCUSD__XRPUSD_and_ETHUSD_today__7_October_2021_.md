Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 07.10.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

Most likely, Bitcoin and Ethereum markets began to develop bearish
corrective waves. Let us study each cryptocurrency in detail.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

The development of a large corrective wave [B] continues. It consists of
subwaves (A)-(B)-(C). An upward wave (C) is unfolding in the shape of an
impulse 1-2-3-4-5. Currently, it is only half-built. It is assumed that
the growth within impulse 3 has ended. Therefore, a corrective decline
within wave 4 towards the level of 50111.00 is expected shortly. At this
level, wave 4 will be 38.2% of impulse 3. The probability of this event
is high.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Sell 55109.00, TP 50111.00

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

After completing the linking wave (X), the market began to decline
within a new corrective wave. It is assumed that a W-X-Y double zigzag
is unfolding. The current wave W is fully completed as a zigzag
[A]-[B]-[C]. Now the bullish linking wave X is developing as a zigzag
[A]-[B]-[C]. Most likely, the completion of the impulse wave [C] will be
in the zone of ​​1.200. Afterward, the price is expected to fall within
wave Y. At level 1.200, wave X will be 61.8% of the wave W, according to
the Fibonacci retracements.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] **** today:

Buy 1.068, TP 1.200

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

The ETHUSD market continues to build corrective wave B in the shape of a
simple zigzag [A]-[B]-[C]. Impulse [A] and zigzag corrective wave [B]
may have been fully completed. An upward wave [C], which has an impulse
structure, is currently unfolding. Most likely, the formation of an
upward wave (3) as an impulse has ended. Thus, shortly the price is
expected to decline within correction (4) towards level 3200.00. At this
level, wave (4) will be 50% of wave (3).

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Sell 3543.79, TP 3200.00
