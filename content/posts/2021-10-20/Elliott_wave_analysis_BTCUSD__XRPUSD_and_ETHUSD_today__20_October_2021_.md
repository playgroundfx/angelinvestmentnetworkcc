Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 20.10.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

All three cryptocurrencies covered in the article continue rising in the
impulse sub-waves, as it is clear from the most recent chart sections.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

The BTCUSD market continues developing the large corrective wave
composed of sub-waves (A)-(B)-(C). In late September, the zigzag-shaped
correction (B) finished, and there is forming the impulse wave (C). So
far, sub-waves 1-2-3-4 have completed in the (C) impulse, and sub-wave 5
is still unfolding. The Bitcoin price could go up to a level of
65770.00. Next, there will start a new bearish trend.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 63957.00, TP 65770.00

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

Ripple continues forming the linking wave X, which has started after the
zigzag-shaped motive wave W finished. Wave X is likely to be a simple
zigzag [A]-[B]-[C], with the impulse wave [C] unfolding inside as an
impulse (1)-(2)-(3)-(4)-(5). The market must have completed correction
(4) as a double zigzag composed of sub-waves W-X-Y. The Ripple price
should be rising in wave (5) to a level of 1.236.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] **** today:

Buy 1.098, TP 1.236

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

Ethereum continues forming correction B. The market has been rising in
the impulse wave [C], composed of sub-waves (1)-(2)-(3)-(4)-(5). A week
ago, the market finished the sideways correction (4) as a contracting
triangle. Next, the market resumed rising in sub-wave (5). The Ethereum
price should rise to a level of 4030.00. Next, there should start a new
bearish trend.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Buy 3846.05, TP 4030.00
