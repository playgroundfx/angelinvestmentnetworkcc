Dollar has its own schedule. Forecast as of 20.10.2021Dmitri Demidenko

Not so long ago, the expectations of the US QE tapering and the shift of
the first federal funds rate hike to 2022 used to support the US dollar.
However, the current situation is different. It is time to adjust
trading scenarios. Let us discuss the Forex outlook and make up a
[EURUSD][1] trading plan.

## Weekly US dollar fundamental forecast

Only those who do nothing make no mistakes. Central banks don't know how
much of inflation is driven by supply shocks and how much is demand-
driven. If, in such conditions, a regulator starts to raise interest
rates, solving supply problems in 2022 will lead to an excessively tight
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) and hinder economic recovery. If there are no rate
hikes, the increase in inflationary expectations will create a new
operation mode similar to the one in the 1970s. The risks of monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) mistakes in such conditions are very high, and each central bank
chooses its own path.

Investors currently expect the Fed to start tapering the QE in November
and raise the federal funds rate hike in the autumn of 2022. These
factors allowed the US dollar to strengthen against a basket of
currencies in the June-September period. The problem is that this
schedule looks rather conservative compared to other central banks. For
example, by next autumn, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand can increase
the cash rate five times, the Bank of England can raise the bank rate
four times, and the Bank of Canada can hike the overnight rate three
times. Therefore, the kiwi, the loonie, and the sterling should
naturally rise against the greenback.

Yes, in the US, the consumer price index has risen at a more than 5%
annual rate for four months in a row, a run not seen since 1990, but it
seems to be anchored. However, consumer prices continue growing in other
advanced economies, forcing the central banks to sound rather hawkish.

What does it mean in Forex [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)? In the short run, it means dollar
pairs should be corrected. At the medium-term investment horizon,
everything will depend on the Fed’s aggressiveness. According to FOMC
member Christopher Waller, if monthly prints of inflation continue to
run high through the remainder of 2021, a more aggressive interest rate
hike than currently expected may be warranted in 2022. Yes, the US
labour market will feature a more robust recovery if the rate remains
low, but Waller is more concerned about the risks of consumer prices
unanchoring than the employment problems.

On the other hand, Reuters experts show no signs of panic. 40 out of 67
economists believe that the Fed will not raise borrowing costs before
2023. The remaining 27 experts predict that the first act of monetary
restriction will take place at the end of 2022. According to the
majority, the Fed won’t be too aggressive because it will face not only
high inflation but also a slowdown in GDP growth in the first half of
next year.

### Weekly [EURUSD][1] trading plan

The matter is which scenario will come true, the one suggested by the
derivatives market or that offered by Reuters experts, and which central
bank will make a mistake. In the meanwhile, the dollar pairs are being
naturally corrected, and the [EURUSD][1] is no exception. As long as the
euro is trading below $1.168, bears will be trying to restore the
downtrend selling on the price rise. If the price breaks out the
important resistance, it could continue rising towards the upper border
of the medium-term consolidation range of 1.155-1.18.
