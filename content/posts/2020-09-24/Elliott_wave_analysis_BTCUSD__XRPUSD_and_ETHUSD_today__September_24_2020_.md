Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 24.09.2020Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I suggest entry signals
to trade each

The BTCUSD is forming the down zigzag A-B-C. The price is declining in
the A impulse currently ongoing. One could consider sell positions in
the current situation.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

 ****

The Bitcoin market continues forming the down corrective wave B as a
double zigzag [W]-[X]-[Y]. There is now unfolding the bear wave [Y]. It
is a simple zigzag (A)-(B)-(C). The impulse wave (A) should complete at
a level of around 9500. Next, the price could be corrected up in the
upward correction (B). After that, the (C) impulse can draw the price
towards level 8000. I recommend entering short positions in the current
situation.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Sell 10299.00, TP 9500.00

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

The current XRPUSD structure is forming the downtrend. There is now
developing the double zigzag (W)-(X)-(Y). Wave (W) is a simple zigzag;
wave (X) is a triple zigzag. The price is now declining in the bear
zigzag A-B-C. Presumably, the impulse wave A will finish at a level of
0.209. Next, the market is to be corrected up in wave B, as it is
outlined in the chart.

### Trading plan for **[XRPUSD][2]** today

Sell 0.221, TP 0.209

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

 ****

After the upward wave (Y) finished, there has started a new downtrend.
There is forming the simple down zigzag A-B-C, where A is a five-wave
impulse, and the B wave is a triple zigzag. After the corrective wave B
completed, there finished sub-waves [1] and [2]. There is now developing
the impulse wave [3] that is composed of the sub-waves
(1)-(2)-(3)-(4)-(5). The price should continue declining to a level of
300.00, where wave (5) of [3] should end.

### Trading plan **[ETHUSD][3]** today

Sell 323.78, TP 300.00
