EURUSD analysis. Actual trading plan and multi-year scenario as of
24.09.2020Mikhail Hypov

This article will be devoted to the Forex market’s most popular pair -
EURUSD. Almost two months have passed since my previous [forecast][1].
Is the scenario still up to date? What are the euro’s current prospects?
Is it safe to hold money in the single European currency? Let’s find
out!

The article covers the following subjects:

## EURUSD Fundamental analysis

No matter the currency pair, fundamental analysis is always hard to do,
because there are too many factors that affect the final rate. However,
there are things that absolutely need to be mentioned, when we’re
analysing the euro.

The first one: the ECB’s refinance rate has been in the negative zone at
minus 0.5% since 18 September 2019. The European Central bank is in a
complicated situation, as even the negative rate cannot raise inflation.

As shown in the chart above, the inflation rate is in the negative zone
at minus 0.2%. The ECB’s goal is holding inflation back at the level of
2% and higher. Obviously, even a negative rate won’t prevent deflation
during a crisis and a risk aversion period.

> Deflation means that money is getting more expensive. It isn’t better
than hyperinflation, and it is as damaging to the economy as
hyperinflation.

There’s no sense in lowering the rate further. That would harm the
European economy even more. Basically, the ECB has only one monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) tool at the moment: QE, or in other words, “money printing”. It’s
what it is doing now.

The chart above shows that the M3 multiplier has already exceeded 10
percentage points and has been growing since March.  Interestingly, the
most part of money is used to credit the government and not the private
sector. Europe is following the USA, pumping the debt bubble and buying
its own debt. In the short term, this approach can support the financial
sector, the stock market, and the eurozone’s economy, indirectly.
However, this effect can’t last forever.

Bloomberg has estimated ECB Governing Council members’ sentiment and
influence gauge. As seen in the chart above, the doves are winning, and
a soft monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) is likely to be kept. The eurozone’s economic
growth could change the game, but the current situation is worse than
the ECB’s forecasts.

The chart above shows that the eurozone’s PMI soared after Q1 and Q2
disastrous values. According to the latest data, August’s stats returned
to a neutral position at 50.1 instead of the expected value of 51.9.

What do these numbers mean?

> PMI (Purchasing Managers Index) measures businesses’ volume of
purchases. When it’s above 50, it means that the volumes of purchase
increased, compared with the previous month. When it’s below 50, the
volume of purchase dropped.

The eurozone’s economy switched to the hibernation mode during the
global quarantine period, and businesses didn’t make any purchases,
hence the collapse of the index. After the lockdown was lifted, the
index predictably recovered. However, the past months’ results point to
a poor economic state. The level of 50 shows no development at all, in
essence. Businesses stand still, waiting for the second wave.  That’s
how the ECB explains such moderate results.

The concerns aren’t groundless, based on the latest [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/).

The average increase in new [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) coronavirus cases in the five largest
European economies has already reached March’s peaks. A new full-scale
lockdown isn’t being discussed yet, but many countries have already
started toughening quarantine measures. So, economists aren’t feeling
optimistic.

## Fundamental analysis of EURUSD. Results

In a simplified way, we have a chain of regularities. On its left side,
there are statistics on Covid cases. On the other side, there’s the Euro
growing more expensive.  However strange it may sound, but the
coronavirus is the main factor that affects the Euro rate.

Until the pandemic is defeated, the economic sentiment will remain
depressive, which doesn’t contribute to any business activities. On the
contrary, it stimulates demand for money and savings.  As long as this
chain remains intact, the euro will be in a global uptrend.

Another [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) to mention is that JPMorgan has moved its UK assets to
Frankfurt, Germany’s financial capital.  The transfer amount is almost
$230 billion! This decision is directly related to Brexit and is quite
demonstrative. It would be interesting to see how it affects the
[EURGBP][2] pair. It’s hard to estimate this event’s immediate influence
on the euro rate, but we can expect that the single European currency
will appreciate even more.

The ECB has already expressed its concern about the euro’s growth, even
if rate control isn’t its responsibility. However, the signal has been
heard, and big hedge funds are reducing long positions in the euro,
according to the CFTC. At the same time, Goldman Sachs says the fair
[EURUSD][3] rate is at 1.3. So we can expect that the rally will
continue. To put the final point, let’s move to technical analysis.

## Technical analysis of EURUSD

[Two months ago,][1] I build EURUSD’s global wave structure. It looks
like the following:

Based on the chart above, the Eur to Dollar pair is in the third wave of
corrective wave (B). There’s no reason for revising the global cycles’
structure now.

I have marked a 5-wave impulse in the weekly chart.

The price has fitted well into the marked wave structure so far (see the
chart above). Will it continue doing so?

As we see can see, the USD index mirrors the EURUSD pair. Over the 26
years displayed in the chart, the correlation ratio has deviated from
“1” only a couple of times.

So, to have an actual scenario for [EURUSD][3], we need to analyse the
dollar and make sure that both scenarios don’t contradict each other.
It’s what I’ll continue my analysis with. I’ll update the scenario for
the USD index, EURUSD and EURGBP, and make a trading plan for the
nearest weeks and months.
