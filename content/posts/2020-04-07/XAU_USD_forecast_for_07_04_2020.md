Gold is getting used to new realityDmitri Demidenko

## Gold is one of the most efficient investment instruments in 2020

Nothing lasts longer than the temporary. Ultra-low, sometimes negative,
interest rates and the QE are used by central banks to support the
economy sliding down in a recession. These are temporary measures that
should be followed by normalizing the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). Nonetheless,
neither the Fed nor the ECB nor other regulators managed to return the
borrowing costs to the levels that were before the global financial
crisis of 2008. Moreover, the coronavirus outbreak forced them to resort
to an aggressive monetary stimulus, including a new round of QE. We
should get used to the fact that the low interest rates will be kept for
a long time, if not forever. So, one can still buy gold.

In theory, the QE, just like issuing more notes, results in
hyperinflation. But real things are different from those described in
textbooks. Over many years, quantitative easing programs, boosted
balance sheets of central banks and huge volumes of cheap liquidity have
been taken by demand. As a result, the Fed had hardly reached the 2% PCE
target, while the consumer prices in Japan and the Eurozone will hardly
reach the 2% target soon. Ultra-low interest rates encourage governments
to take loans, which is another growth driver for gold. Amid the
coronavirus pandemic, the debt-to-GDP ratio will increase in most
countries, to cover the budget deficits, they will issue more bonds with
the yields close to zero, and gold is a higher-yielding alternative to
bonds. Does it make sense to compare papers and a physical asset?

In addition to the ultra-easy monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of central banks, record
low rates of the global bond market and the increase in the debt/GDP
ratio, the world’s major currencies are weak. Therefore, the contango in
the gold market looks natural. Gold futures in New York are more
expensive than spot gold in London, as [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are willing to buy gold
at higher prices in the future.

Gold has been the most effective investment instruments since the
beginning of 2020. It is a strong rival for the US dollar and the US
Treasuries. It might seem strange that gold is rising together with the
US stocks, and, sometimes, together with the greenback. Nonetheless, the
story of 2008-2011 proves that the [XAU/USD][2] may be growing even amid
the S&P 500 uptrend or the rising dollar. Market shocks change the links
between the markets.

When the central banks have almost exhausted their monetary expansion
tools and are losing control over the financial markets, the major
currencies are weak, and low yields on global bond market are long-term
factors, gold will be trading up. That was proven in 2011 when gold hit
an all-time high of over $1900 per ounce. Citi says this high will be
broken through in 2021, it suggests gold should reach $2000. I believe
that a buy signal will be sent if gold goes down to $1600-$1630 or
breaks through April’s highs. In this case, it will be relevant to enter
longs.
