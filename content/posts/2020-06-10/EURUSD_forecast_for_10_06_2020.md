Dollar lets out dovesDmitri Demidenko

## EUR/USD is up to three-month highs as Jerome Powell is expected to
sound dovish

The best is the enemy of good. The Fed is in a difficult situation after
the publication of the US jobs report for May. The drop in the
unemployment rate and the biggest surge in employment since the end of
World War Two suggest the V-shaped recovery of the US economy, which is
expected by the White House. The Fed was opposing this idea until
recently. According to Jerome Powell, it will take a long time until the
US GDP is back to the pre-crisis growth pace. This should require an
extra fiscal stimulus. Strong domestic data allow the US central bank to
sound more optimistic than it did before. However, optimism could drop
the US stock market.

Powell has some negative experiences. In late 2018, his announcement
that the current interest rates were far from being neutral started
sell-offs of the S&P 500. The Fed’s chair must be extremely careful.
Ahead of the publication of the FOMC June meeting’s outcomes, markets
expect Powell to sound dovish. That is why the [EUR/USD][1] has
rebounded up from the support at 1.124-1.1245 I [suggested earlier
][2]and increased by an entire figure. Investors expect the Fed to
express the willingness to hold the interest rates low for some years
and signal the Treasury yields targeting [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). Both factors are
bearish for the US dollar, which is also weighed on by the seasonal
factor. In June, the USD index fell in eight cases out of the past ten
by 0.7% on average.

The greenback has been ahead of the plan so far, as it has been more
than 2% down since early June. However, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are still willing to
buy the [EUR/USD][1]. According to DoubleLine Capital, the US twin
deficit (budget deficit and foreign trade deficit) should increase to
12% of GDP, and the dollar should be back to the levels of 2011. The
euro is supported by the EU huge fiscal stimulus, which could mitigate
the recession in the euro-area. Besides, amid aggressive rate cuts by
global central banks, the ECB negative interest rates are not so harmful
to the euro as they were before.

On the other hand, the rise in the Treasury yields and a lower chance
that the Fed will cut the federal funds rate below zero are positive
factors for the US dollar. These benefits of greenback can be
neutralized if the Fed starts yield control [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), which should happen
in September, according to Bloomberg. Investors can be lured back to the
US dollar if there is COVID-19 second wave or a new round of trade wars.
Unless this happens, the main scenario suggests the [EUR/USD][1] should
rise to 1.147 and 1.155, and it will be relevant to buy the euro on the
corrections down, as I wrote before. However, Jerome Powell’s
carelessness and the fact that the euro-dollar rally ahead of the
publication of the FOMC June meeting’s results implies the Fed’s dovish
tone may become a reason for a drawdown.
