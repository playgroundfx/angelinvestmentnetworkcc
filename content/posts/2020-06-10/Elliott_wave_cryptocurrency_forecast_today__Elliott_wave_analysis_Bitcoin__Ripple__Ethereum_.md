The upward impulse wave A continues forming. There is now developing the
final impulse wave [5], where sub-waves (1)-(2)-(3)-(4) have completed.
The market is now following the initial phase of the final wave (5) that
is likely to be an impulse. There have completed the first two small
sub-waves of this impulse, so the price should continue rising in the
sub-waves 3-4-5 to a level of 11000, as it is outlined in the chart.

At the most recent section of the chart, the linking wave X is
developing as a triple zigzag [W]-[X]-[Y]-[X]-[Z]. The market is now
following the linking down wave [X] that is a simple zigzag (A)-(B)-(C).
Impulse (A) and corrective wave (B) have completed. The price should be
declining in the (C) impulse to a support level in the near future.
After that, the market should start rising in the final motive wave [Z]

The ETHUSD market is forming the final five-wave impulse [5] that is a
part of the large impulse wave A. Impulse [5] consists of sub-waves
(1)-(2)-(3)-(4)-(5), where the corrective wave (4) has completed as a
double three w-x-y. The market is now rising in wave (5) that may
complete as an impulse. It is only half-complete, so the price should
continue rising to a level of 257.00.
