Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 29.09.2020Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I suggest entry signals
to trade each cryptocurrency.

Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ripple must have completed corrective waves and
started new downtrends. We shall monitor the cryptocurrency market.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

 ****

The BTCUSD market is forming the down corrective wave B that started in
August 2020. The B correction is likely to complete as a double zigzag
[W]-[X]-[Y], where the sub-waves [W] and [X] have completed, the market
is now going down in the final zigzag-shaped wave [Y]. The corrective
wave (B) of [Y] must have finished, and the impulse wave (C) is now
unfolding. The market should be declining to a level below the previous
low made by wave (A).

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Sell 10692.00, TP 10107.00

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

 ****

The XRPUSD market continues declining in the corrective wave [Z] that is
likely to finish as a double down zigzag. The sub-waves (W) and (X) have
completed. Wave (W) is a simple zigzag, wave (X) is a triple zigzag.
There is now unfolding a new bear zigzag, with the bullish correction B
completed inside. The Ripple price should soon start declining to a
level below the previous low made by wave A.

### Trading plan for **[XRPUSD][2]** today

Sell 0.241, TP 0.218

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

 ****

The market is now moving in the downward zigzag A-B-C. The impulse wave
A has completed, and the corrective wave B has finished as a triple
zigzag. The market is now following the beginning of the new bear
impulse, with impulse [1] and correction [2] completed within. The
market could be declining to a level below the previous low made by wave
A, which is below level 311.21.

### Trading plan  **[ETHUSD][3] **today

Sell 352.35, TP 311.21
