Dollar is a Forex anti stress toy. Forecast as of 29.09.2020Dmitri
Demidenko

During the stress time, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s buy the greenback even if the global
financial stress is the US. Let us see the Forex sentiment and make up a
[EURUSD][1] trading plan.

## Weekly fundamental US dollar forecast

It is useful when you have something to rely on. The rally of the US
stock indices, the Chinese yuan, and the British pound encouraged the
[EURUSD][1] bulls to go ahead, and the pair didn’t go below the bottom
of figure 16. However, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s do not want to sell safe havens. There
is growing uncertainty around the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic
and the most unpredictable US presidential elections in recent decades.

Due to the divergence between monetary policies and economic growth, the
Chinese yuan continues strengthening. According to Morgan Stanley,
annual inflows of foreign capitals to China’s stock and bond markets
through 2030 will be $100 billion and $80-$120 billion accordingly. The
strong currency of the country that is the world’s largest consumer of
goods and services, is a bullish factor for the currency of the export-
led euro-area. There are also talks that the UK and EU will strike a
Brexit deal at the last moment. It is a positive factor for both the
pound and the euro. However, the [EURUSD][1] trend is not yet clear.

The euro has fallen as [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s exited dollar shorts, which, in the
week through September 22, have reached the highest level since November
2017. Forex analysts claim that, over the past twenty-five years, the
market has never been as confident of the long-term weakness of the
greenback as it is now. This confidence is significantly shaken in late
September.

It seems the dollar should be under pressure now as the political risks
in the US are the highest among G10 currencies (except for the UK,
perhaps). However, the greenback is strengthening. According to HSBC,
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s buy out the US dollar during stress, even if the stress
originates from the USA. BofA Merrill Lynch expects the dollar to
appreciate before the US presidential election, or maybe even after it,
sending the [EURUSD][1] down to 1.14 in late 2020.

Mizuho Bank argues that when Joe Biden strengthens his rating advantage
over Donald Trump in the TV debates, the greenback will slide down.
Everything good for the current US president is good for the dollar. If
the Democratic candidate wins the election, the US twin deficit should
expand, and the dollar will weaken.

### Weekly trading plan for [EURUSD][1]

The Conservatives and the Democrats, which offered and new $2.2 trillion
plan, could still agree on the fiscal stimulus. In this case, the US
stock indexes will rise, and the safe-haven demand should weaken. The
euro could also be supported by the deal between the UK and the EU. On
the other hand, the deflation in the euro-area, as well as the talks
about a boost in the European QE and the second pandemic wave, press the
[EURUSD][1] down. The pair could start consolidation in the range of
1.161-1.177. If the price breaks out the resistance at 1.17, it should
continue rising to the top of the consolidation range.
