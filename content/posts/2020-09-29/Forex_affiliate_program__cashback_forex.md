Forex affiliate program - CashBack forexOleg Tkachenko

CashBack is a part of the broker commission that the partner can share
with his referrals at his discretion. It works in the following way. A
broker partner brings new referral clients to the broker; referrals
enter trades. The affiliate, regardless of the trades results, receives
a commission from the broker and returns from 5% to 95% of this
commission to the referral.

The broker got a new client; the affiliate got a commission; the
referral compensated for a part of the trades costs. The business model
is similar to forex rebates cashback. Everybody is happy. Read on and
learn in detail how CashBack works and what benefits it has in affiliate
marketing.

### What is CashBack in Forex affiliate programs? How CashBack helps to
increase the performance of client attraction campaign

Forex brokers affiliate programs are a chance to make money on
attracting new clients who are willing to make profits in the foreign
exchange market. You can read in more detail about brokers partner
programs and [how to](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-trading-how-to/) create your affiliate network from scratch in [this
overview][1]. Today, I will dwell on such a tool of the affiliate
program as cashback. It helps a partner strengthen the business
relationship of a Forex partner and the referral to the advantage of
both parties.

You will learn from this article:

  * What is CashBack in a Forex affiliate program?
  * How can you start an affiliate program in the LiteForex client space and activate cashback?
  * How can you adjust the cashback [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) the most effectively?

## How to activate CashBack in an affiliate program

CashBack is a service through which partners can share a part of their
commission with their referrals (that is, compensate for a part of the
client’s trading costs). Giving back a part of his/her affiliate
earnings, the partner offers new clients better [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/). The partners set
the percentage of cashback as they see fit. So, the new clients
compensate for a part of the spreads and commissions they pay.

 **Benefits of CashBack:**

  * Competitive advantage over other [Forex trading](https://www.fintechee.com/forex-trading-strategies/) affiliate programs.
  * You can attract more referral traders offering better [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of compensation for transaction cost.
  * Psychological factor. The amount of compensation is not so significant as its very fact as a sign of respect for the new client. Сashback strengthens partnerships.

The referral also benefits from the CashBack. The cashback is paid
regardless of the transaction results. If the trades are losing, the
trader reduces the losses.

If the trader’s transactions yield profit, he/she increases profit
through the cashback. How the Revenue Share program with cashback works
is described in general [here][2].

 **What you should know about the CashBack:**

  * The minimum cashback percentage is 5%, the increment is 5%, the maximum rate is 95%.
  * The cashback is paid to the referral from the affiliate earnings once a day.
  * A partner can change the percentage of the commission compensation for an individual campaign (referral/group of referrals) in the personal profile at any time any number of times.
  * Cashback option can be activated only in the Revenue Share type. In the affiliate program type CPS, for example, there is not a cashback option.
  * The cashback amount is a percentage of the partner’s commission. Affiliate commission is a part of the trade costs of the referral when he/he enters trades.

 **How to enable Cashback in the Personal Profile:**

 **Step 1.** On the main page of your personal profile, click on the
AFFILIATE tab on the left menu.

 **Step 2.** In the affiliate profile, click on the Create a new
campaign. Select the Revenue Share type, move the CashBack slider to the
right, and specify the percentage you will compensate your referrals.

You invent the name of the campaign and description yourself.

 **Step 3.** You copy the referral link, attract new traders, and
monitor the real time statistics. A small tip. To attract more clients,
you can use personal landings for your online marketing.

You can find them in the _ **PROMO section**_.

Let us explore the Statistics box:

  * CashBack - the name of the campaign. You can create any number of campaigns and call them as you want.
  * TYPE of affiliate program – in our case, it is Revenue Share. IMPORTANT. CashBack is only in the Revenue Share type.
  * CLICKS - clicks on your referral link.
  * REGISTRATIONS - the number of registrations of referrals who followed your link.
  * CONVERSION- the percentage of registered to those who just followed the link.
  * DEPOSIT/WITHDRAWAL – statistics on the referrals’ accounts.
  * TRADES – the numbers of trades entered by referrals.
  * CASHBACK/rate – the amount you compensate the referrals
  * SUB-COMMISSION – the commission that an affiliate received from referrals’ trading activity (you can find this information in the main menu of forex affiliate programs).
  * COMMISSION FEES – money that the broker pays to the affiliate for attraction new clients (referrals)

Below is the chart that displays the number of visits/clicks,
registrations, and the commission that the affiliate has received. You
can monitor the moments when the referral entered trades most actively
(a spike in commission fees) and compare them with the number of new
registrations.

And finally, there is a list of referral joined the campaign at the
bottom of the page. Use the settings of the table to group the list
according to the needed parameters.

## Why do you create several affiliate campaigns?

An affiliate can create as many Revenue Share campaigns in the personal
profile as he/she wants. An unlimited number of referrals can join one
forex cashback rebate campaign. The cashback percentage is set for each
separate campaign (that is active for all referrals within one
campaign).

The referral enlisted in one campaign won’t be able to join another one
without deleting her/his profile. Hence, I recommend you to create
several different campaigns with a different percent of cashback. You
will determine which referral link share with various referrals
according to your client attraction strategy.

 **Benefits of creating several Affiliate Programs:**

  1. Create campaigns in the Revenue Share and CPS programs. Sometime later, compare the results and decide which type is more convenient for you. Revenue Share with the affiliate compensation in percentage is more suitable for attracting active traders with constant trade turnover.
  2. Each campaign is a separate referral link. By making several campaigns, you can use the referral links in different promotion channels.

  * Social media, trader forums.
  * On your own landings or blog.
  * At seminars, trader meetings.

Monitor the statistics in your affiliate profile, and you will see which
promotion channels are more efficient at which moments. You will also
see how the change in the cashback percentage affects the number of new
clients you attract.

 **Recommendations to partners on using Cashback in an affiliate
program:**

  *  **Do not be mean.** Develop a flexible system of the increase in the cash rebates that the referral increases the trade volumes. With an increase in trade volume, the trade costs will be growing, and so, the forex affiliate earnings, which he/she shares with the referral. Both sides benefit from such a cycle.
  *  **Create and manage a system of affiliate programs.** Group your referrals according to different criteria: county, trading instrument, strategy, and so on.
  *  **Develop a reward system.** For one group of referrals, 20% will be enough; for another, 80% is too little. To find a middle ground for a particular group, create dozens of campaigns with a small number of referrals. This will make it easier to stimulate individual groups of forex traders to increase their turnover by changing the percentage of cashback "on the fly" and track the level of referral requests in the context of attraction channels.
  *  **Get sub-affiliates.** As an affiliate, you receive up to 70% of your referral spread and 10% of your sub-affiliates' income (which can also attract referrals) paid by LiteForex. Build a multi-level network of sub-partners and referrals to increase passive income.
  *  **Use as many channels as possible to attract referrals.** Offer several types of LiteForex programs, work with different categories of potential clients - don't be afraid to experiment and be persistent!
