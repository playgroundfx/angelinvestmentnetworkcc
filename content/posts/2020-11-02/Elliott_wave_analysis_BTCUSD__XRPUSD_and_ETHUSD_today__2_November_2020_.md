Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 02.11.2020Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I suggest entry signals
to trade each cryptocurrency.

All cryptocurrency pairs dealt with in the article are forming the final
legs of the uptrends. Bitcoin is building the bullish impulse [5],
Ethereum is forming the zigzag-shaped sub-wave (z), the Ripple is
building the [Z] wave. Therefore, it is relevant to enter buy trades.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

 ****

Like in the previous trading week, the market is forming the final
element of the linking wave [X], which is unfolding as a double zigzag,
that is the market is developing the (Y) wave composed of the sub-waves
A-B-C. Since the sideways wave B finished as a contracting triangle, the
market has been rising in the impulse wave C. Four out of five legs in
the C impulse have completed so far. The price should be rising in wave
[5] of С to a level of 15200.00.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 13765.25, TP 15200.00

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

 ****

The XRPUSD market continues forming the bullish correction B as a triple
zigzag [W]-[X]-[Y]-[X]-[Z]. The first four legs of the pattern have
completed. The bearish linking wave [X] has recently completed as a
triple combination. The price is now rising in the final wave [Z]. The
Ripple price should be rising towards level 0.263 in the next few days.
Therefore, it is relevant to buy.

### Trading plan for **[XRPUSD][2]** today:

Buy 0.243, TP 0.263

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

The ETHUSD market is also forming the upward corrective wave B as a
double zigzag [W]-[X]-[Y]. There is now forming wave [Y] as a complex
pattern. The [Y] is unfolding as a triple zigzag (w)-(x)-(y)-(xx)-(z).
The downward linking wave (xx) may have completed recently. The price
should now be rising in the final motive wave (z). The Ethereum price is
meant to be rising a little higher than the previous high made by the
(y) zigzag, level 423.00.

### Trading plan for  **[ETHUSD][3] **today:

Buy 401.35, TP 423.00
