Dollar caught a fish in dark waters. Forecast for 02.11.2020Dmitri
Demidenko

The primary risk associated with the US presidential election is a
possible election-related dispute. Furthermore, there are divergences in
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) and economic performance. So, the [EURUSD][1] is
expectedly down. Let us discuss the Forex outlook and make up a
[EURUSD][1] trading plan.

##  **Weekly US dollar fundamental forecast**

October has become the worst month for the US stock market since March.
The bond market has experienced the worst drop since September 2018. In
the last week of October, the [S&P 500][2] sank 5.6%, while the Treasury
yield rose to 0.858%. According to Bespoke Investment Group, this has
only been 17 times since 1962, when the US Treasury yields rose along
with the stock indexes’ drop. Investors believe that Joe Biden’s victory
will result in the fiscal stimulus boost provided that the Democrats
take control over the Senate. If it doesn’t happen, the extra stimulus
package will hardly be accepted by Congress. Is it better to buy
currencies, selling stocks and bonds?

The [S&P 500][2] bulls hope for a “blue wave.” However, it doesn’t
guarantee that the stock index will resume the uptrend. In 2016, the
Wall Street experts predicted the US stock market to fall in case of
Donald Trump's victory. At first, everything was going on as expected,
but the stock indexes quickly recovered afterward. A wrong forecast cost
George Soros $1 billion. And not only him.

Nobody wants to repeat the same mistakes, especially since the [S&P
500][2] could continue correction, no matter who wins. The main source
of uncertainty is Donald Trump’s willingness to challenge election
results. As of October 31, nearly 90 million Americans already have cast
their ballots, which is over 65% of the total votes from 2016. Donald
accuses the Democrats of election [fraud](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/cryptocurrency-fraud/).

Uncertainty makes [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s buy safe-haven assets. However, when the
Treasuries are being sold off, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s tend to buy the US dollar.
Besides, the growing yield-gap between U.S. and German government bonds
sends the [EURUSD][1] down as well.

Investors are selling the euro off amid the increase in the number of
COVID-19 cases in Europe and the introduction of new restrictions by the
euro-area governments. Although the euro-area economy grew by 12.7% and
outperformed the U.S. growth in the third quarter, everything can
radically change in the fourth quarter. The median estimate of 18
Financial Times experts suggests that the euro-area GDP will contract by
2.3% in October-December. At the same time, Oxford Economics predicts
that the United States will expand by 3% over the same period.
Divergence in economic growth sends the [EURUSD][1] down. Furthermore,
there is also a divergence in monetary policies.

### Dynamics of GDP

The ECB is willing to boost the monetary stimulus in December. 59% of
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg believe that the Fed, on the contrary,
won’t expand the assets purchases until the end of 2021. Working
directly with the Federal Reserve, large banks do not expect any QE
changes until the middle of next year.

### Weekly [EURUSD][1] trading plan

Under such conditions, the [EURUSD][1] is likely to continue falling
towards 1.16 and 1.154-1.156. The absence of the “blue wave” and/or
Donald Trump’s rejection of the election results will suggest a deeper
correction down.
