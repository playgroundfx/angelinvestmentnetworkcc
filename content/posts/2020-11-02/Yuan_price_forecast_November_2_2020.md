Central banks will swallow yuan. Forecast as of 02.11.2020Dmitri
Demidenko

The USDCNH can well continue falling for several reasons. The renminbi
is strengthening amid the economic growth gap and the capital inflow to
China. Besides, the world’s central banks tend to buy more yuan. Let us
discuss the renminbi outlook and make up a [USDCNH][1] trading plan.

## Monthly yuan fundamental forecast

The right time is essential for effective reforms. Beijing's financial
market liberalization resulted in capital outflows and a weakening of
the yuan. Some people could believe that the simplification of access
for foreign [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s to China’s futures market and the abandoning of
the counter-cyclical factor in setting the exchange rate of the national
currency is a try to stop the [USDCNH][1] fall. They were wrong,
however. Yes, similar actions five years ago sent the renminbi down, the
current situation is completely different.

In late 2015, the Fed began normalizing monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), which
strengthened the US dollar. The money was flowing into the USA, and the
burst bubble in the Chinese stock market accelerated the process of the
capital outflow from the country. In 2020, the money is going to Asia.
Since early 2020, foreign [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s bought Chinese government bonds
worth ¥370 billion ($55 billion). Over the first half of 2020, China
attracted $76 billion of foreign direct investments. The US, for
example, attracted $51 billion. On an annual basis, foreign investments
in China fell by 4%, but in the USA, it was  61% down, and the global
indicator dropped by 50%.

The liberalization of financial markets carried out by Beijing aims at
the yuan’s internationalization. The yuan is meant to get a higher
position in international trade, settlements, and conversion operations.
The renminbi accounts for about 2% in the global FX reserves, which is
extremely low, considering China’s GDP in the global economy. In growing
demand of the world’s regulators for China’s currency is an essential
bearish factor for the [USDCNH][1].

But still, the primary growth drivers for the yuan are the divergence in
the economic growth and the high appeal of China’s assets, also because
of the widening spread between the US and China’s bonds since the
beginning of the year. Besides, robust GDP growth is a reason to buy
China’s equities. The Chinese manufacturing PMI is above 50, which
signals the economic expansion for the eighth consecutive month. The
services PMI has reached its seven-year high.

Due to the difficult epidemiological situation, the US GDP is likely to
slow significantly, and the euro-area economy could face a double
recession. China’s economy, however, seems to be stable amid the global
crisis. So, it is natural that the yuan is growing.

### Monthly [USDCNH][1] trading plan

The [USDCNH][1] sell-offs are going to accelerate if Joe Biden wins the
US presidential election. The Democratic candidate should abandon
protectionism policies carried out by Trump. In this case, China may not
worry about new trade wars. The first and the second target for short
positions at 6.7 and 6.65, set in [September][2] and [October][3], have
already been reached. The current correction of the [USDCNH][1] will
provide a good chance to add up to shorts with a target at 6.5. If Trump
wins the election, one should buy the pair in the short-term.
