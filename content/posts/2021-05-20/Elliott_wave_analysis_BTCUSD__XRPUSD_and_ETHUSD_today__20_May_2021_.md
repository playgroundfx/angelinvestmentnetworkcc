Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 20.05.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

The cryptocurrency market is forming descending impulses. Let us explore
the situation for each cryptocurrency pair in more detail.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

After the upward corrective wave had completed as a zigzag, the BTCUSD
market started developing a bear impulse wave. This impulse should be
composed of the sub-waves [1]-[2]-[3]-[4]-[5]. So far, there have
completed the first two sub-waves, a five-wave impulse [1] and a zigzag-
shaped correction [2]. There is unfolding the third impulse wave, namely
its middle part, sub-wave (3). the corrective wave 4 should soon form,
and the price will decline in sub-wave 5 to the low of 29800.00, marked
by sub-wave 3.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Sell 39609.00, TP 29800.00

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

The market is declining, so the previous layout is not relevant now. The
market should be forming the first leg of the double zigzag, wave (W).
The (W) wave is composed of three major sub-waves A-B-C, where the first
two ones look completed. There is unfolding the bearish impulse wave C.
Correction [4] could end soon, and the price will resume declining in
the final sub-wave [5]. The Ripple price could go down to a level of
0.777, a little lower than the level of impulse A completion.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] today:

Sell 1.134, TP 0.777

* * *

## Elliott wave Ethereum analysis

The ETHUSD market is developing the initial part of the impulse down
wave. There should have completed impulse 1 and correction 2, which is a
zigzag opposite the impulse. There is currently unfolding the third
impulse wave, namely its sub-wave [3]. The first three legs of wave [3]
must have finished, and correction 4 should complete soon. After that,
the price could decline to a level of 1800.00, marked by wave 3.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Sell 2600.76, TP 1800.00
