Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 20.05.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

Yesterday, the priority pattern for selling oil from the level of 64.89
with the target at 63.32 yielded profits.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

Yesterday, the priority pattern for selling oil from the level of 64.89
with the target at 63.32 yielded profits. The short-term trend reversed
down due to strong downward price momentum. As a result, the
Intermediary Zone 64.34 - 64.07 was broken out, and the lower Target
Zone 61.69 - 61.16 became the target for the rest of the week.

Now the prices are correcting. As part of the correction, the traders
are trying to break out the Additional Zone 63.39 - 63.26. If the zone
is broken out, then oil prices may move to the resistance zone 64.85 -
64.07.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

  1. Sell according to the pattern in Additional Zone 63.39 - 63.26. TakeProfit: 61.95. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. Sell from the zone of 64.85 - 64.59. TakeProfit: Target Zone 61.69 - 61.16. StopLoss: 65.63.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

The trading idea to buy gold when level 1873 is broken out with the
target at 1888 yielded profits. After that, a correction began, within
which the price returned below the Gold Zone 1878 - 1876 and tested the
Intermediary Zone 1867 - 1865.

The Intermediary Zone serves as the short-term uptrend's key support. As
long as it is held by buyers, it is profitable to look for long trades
with the target at 1888 and in the Target Zone 2 1903 - 1898.

If the Intermediary Zone is broken out, the short-term trend will
reverse down. In this case, sell the gold with a target in the lower
Target Zone 1845 - 1840.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

Buy according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 1867 - 1865.
TakeProfit: 1888, Target Zone 2 1903 - 1898. StopLoss: according to the
pattern rules.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

The euro price is trading in the correction. Yesterday, the Additional
Zone 1.2201 - 1.21968 was broken out. At the end of the week, the target
of the correction is the test of the Intermediary Zone 1.2157 - 1.2148.

Now the euro prices are growing towards the resistance zone 1.2208 -
1.2196. It is profitable to look for a sell pattern in this zone.

After reaching the Intermediary Zone 1.2157 - 1.2148, it will be
possible to look for the euro purchases with a target at yesterday's
high. The Intermediary Zone serves as the border of the short-term
uptrend.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

Sell according to the pattern in the zone of 1.2208 - 1.2196.
TakeProfit: Intermediary Zone 1.2157 - 1.2148. StopLoss: according to
the pattern rules.
