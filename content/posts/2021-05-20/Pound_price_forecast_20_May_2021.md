Pound breaks free. Forecast as of 20.05.2021Dmitri Demidenko

Despite the hawkish stance of the last FOMC meeting, there is little
doubt that the Fed will maintain the current QE scale for a long time.
This fact puts pressure on the US dollar and allows the [GBPUSD][1] pair
to grow. Let us discuss the Forex outlook and make up a trading plan

## Weekly pound fundamental forecast

Size matters. The US economy is the largest in the world, and the Fed is
the largest central bank. Its impact on financial markets is enormous,
so Jerome Powell and his colleagues should think twice before making any
statements. It is unlikely that they can make the same statement as the
BoE head, Andrew Bailey, who said before the British parliament that the
regulator would not allow inflation to go beyond 2% for a long time.
Imagine what would have happened to the US dollar if the Fed's chairman
said something like that? While he remains silent, Andrew Bailey's
hawkish stance gives [GBPUSD][1] buyers confidence.

What is permissible for Jupiter may not be permissible for a bull. The
GBPUSD sellers cannot strengthen, including because of the different
macro statistics for the UK and the USA. Unlike the US one, British
employment data exceeded Bloomberg forecasts, so the unemployment
unexpectedly fell to 4.8%, and the number of vacancies increased by 13%.
Along with the acceleration of April inflation from 0.7% to 1.5% YoY,
the recovery of the labor market increases the likelihood of an interest
rate hike in 2022 and supports the sterling. Do not be embarrassed by
the relatively low consumer price figures. Its growth is constrained by
a temporary 5% tax on hospitality services, which will be in effect
until the end of September. If not for this tax, the CPI would have
grown to 3.2%.

While the Bank of England takes the same stance on the temporary nature
of high inflation as the Fed, MPC hawks allow themselves more than their
FOMC counterparts. In addition to Andrew Bailey's statement that
extended CPI periods above 2% should not be tolerated, Andy Haldane's
lobbying for the QE cut by £100bn at the last BoE meeting is recalled.
It is worth noting his phrase that the central bank will eventually have
to halt the inflow of cheap liquidity.

If in the first quarter the pound and the USD were perceived as the main
Forex favorites, thanks to the accelerated vaccination, then in the
second quarter, contradictory US data led [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s to disappointment
with the US dollar. At the same time, the British economy justifies the
advances given to it, and the positive [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) from retail sales and UK PMI
data could encourage the [GBPUSD][1] bulls.

In my opinion, the pair's decline after the publication of the FOMC
protocol, which allegedly contained hints of curtailing the US QE, is
temporary. It is highly doubtful that the Fed would adjust its monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) based on two or three US jobs report. In my opinion, the Fed
needs at least six to take action.

### Weekly [GBPUSD][1] trading plan

Thus, it is too early to talk about the tapering of the $120 billion QE
program by Jerome Powell and his colleagues, which keeps the pressure on
the greenback. At the same time, positive [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) from the G10 countries
contributes to the growth of their currencies. Sterling is no exception.
The return of [GBPUSD][1] price above level 1.417 will allow to add up
to longs entered at the levels of [1,3835][2] and [1.3925][3] with
targets at 1.433 and 1.45.
