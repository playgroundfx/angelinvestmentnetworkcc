Dollar made it a big deal. Forecast as of 20.05.2021Dmitri Demidenko

A necessary condition to continue the [EURUSD][1] uptrend is the Fed’s
passive [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). If the US central bank starts taking active steps,
traders will have to correct the plans for reaching level $1.25 by the
euro. Let us discuss the Forex outlook and make up a trading plan.

## Weekly US dollar fundamental forecast

The market, which alternates between Fear and Greed, often makes a big
deal out of nothing. After the publication of the FOMC April meeting’s
minutes, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s were surprised by the fact that, at a press
conference, Jerome Powell argued that it was too early to taper the QE,
while some of the FOMC officials were talking about adjusting monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). Why did not the Fed Chair mention that fact? Will a strong US
jobs report for May become a reason to reduce the $120-billion
quantitative easing program already in June?

According to some FOMC officials, if the US economy continues moving
quickly towards the Fed’s targets, it would be appropriate to start
discussing changes in monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) at the Fed’s next meetings. It is
a warning sign for the buyers of the [EURUSD][1], US stocks, and bonds.
The Treasury yields rose following the publication of the Fed meeting’s
minutes, and the [S&P 500][2] closed the next trading session in the
red. It has been down at 6 out of the last 8 trading sessions. In fact,
“some” does not mean all. Most Fed officials still believe that the US
economy is far from the Fed's targets. Jerome Powell spoke about this at
a press conference.

Besides, the US central bankers had not known the April employment data
at the meeting, and the US jobs report discouraged even the FOMC hawks.
For example, according to St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, if the
US economy gets to the point where the pandemic is largely behind, the
Fed’s officials could discuss the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) adjustments.
Nonetheless, the same person related the Fed’s monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) changes
to reaching the herd immunity, which must have been done, according to
the share of vaccinated adults (83.1%).

Fear has a hundred eyes. Markets are scared of the QE tapering, the
related surge in Treasury yields, and the drop in stock indexes. I do
not think this is what the Fed plans. The Fed continues buying out
assets, halting the Treasury yields, which have recently been growing
slower than the European ones. This encourages the [EURUSD][1] bulls.

At first sight, the growth of the euro-area bond yields and euro
strengthening increases the risk of the ECB verbal interventions.
However, unlike that in the first quarter, the current situation results
from the right reasons – the vaccination acceleration in the EU and
positive changes in the euro-area economy. According to the Vice-
President of the European Central Bank, Luis de Guindos, the risks to
the euro-area economic development are much more balanced than in the
past, and the victory over the pandemic will suggest that the emergency
asset purchase program is temporary.

### Weekly [EURUSD][1] trading plan

I suppose [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s overestimated the signals of the US QE tapering. The
time has not come yet. Therefore, considering the positive [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) from
Europe, including a strong PMI report, one could add up to the
[EURUSD][1] longs entered at [level 1.211][3] if the price rolls back to
a level above 1.2205.
