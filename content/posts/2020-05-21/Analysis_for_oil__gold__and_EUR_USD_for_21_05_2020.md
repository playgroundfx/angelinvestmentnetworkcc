Analysis for oil, gold, and EUR/USD for 21.05.2020Alex Rodiоnov

###  **USCrude – oil**

Oil price continues rising, it is approaching Target Zone 4 [34.17 –
33.42]. The uptrend key support moves to the zone of [23.75 – 22.85].
Expect the zone test and enter purchases at good prices.

![LiteForex: Analysis for oil, gold, and EUR/USD for 21.05.2020][1]

Gold Zone 3 [30.04 — 29.67] was broken out yesterday. Now, the target in
the short-term uptrend is Target Zone 4 [34.17 - 33.42].

Strong support zones to enter purchases are:

  1. Additional Zone [30.50 - 30.28];
  2. Intermediary Zone [28.25 — 27.80].

I suggest expecting the price correction down to these zones and look
for a buy pattern.

###  **XAUUSD – gold**

The gold middle-term uptrend continues. The price is now trading under
the resistance Target Zone 5 [1757.2 - 1751.2]. If buyers break the
resistance out, the next growth target will be Target Zone 6 [1817.2 –
1811.2].

The trend border is at [1673.6 — 1664.4].

The short-term trend is up. The price is now trading in the correction.
The correction target is likely to be at Intermediary Zone [1719.3 –
1714.8].

Players were testing the intraday resistance Additional Zone [1751.0 –
1748.7]. It wasn’t broken out, and the price has started declining. If
you have sell trades entered in this zone, I recommend moving them to
the breakeven.

If the price starts rising from the current levels, and Additional Zone
is broken out, we shall enter purchases on the retest with the target at
Gold Zone [1801.1 — 1796.5].

  2. If Additional Zone [1751.0 — 1748.7] is broken out, buy on the retest. TakeProfit: Gold Zone [1801.1 - 1796.5]. StopLoss: below the local low.

###  **EURUSD – euro/dollar**

The EUR/USD continues rising. The middle-term trend is up. The growth
target is to break through the high of May 1 and reach Target Zone 2
[1.1109 – 1.1091]. One can consider buy trades on the 50% correction
opposite to the previous impulse.

The EUR/USD short-term trend is up. The target for purchases entered in
Additional Zone [1.0930 – 1.0926] was reached yesterday. The price is
being corrected again today, it is testing the new Additional Zone
[1.0953 – 1.0949].

I recommend entering new purchases according to the pattern in the zone
with the target at yesterday’s high.

The second zone to enter purchases is Intermediary Zone [1.0908 –
1.0899]. This is the border of the uptrend.
