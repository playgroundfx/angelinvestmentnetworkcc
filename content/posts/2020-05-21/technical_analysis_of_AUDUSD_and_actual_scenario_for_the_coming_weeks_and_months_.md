AUDUSD. Fundamental and technical analysis. Short- and long-term
forecastsMikhail Hypov

##  **AUDUSD: Fundamental analysis, COVID-19, channel and trend
analysis, TM candlestick projections**

###  **Fundamental analysis**

My colleague [Dmitri Demidenko][1] has provided an express fundamental
analysis of the factors which influence the rate of [AUDUSD][2]. Feel
free to [check][3] his article. Dmitri’s overall estimation is positive,
based on the analysis of macroeconomic processes and fundamental
indicators.  I will only highlight some details that need a special
mention.

Australia is a well-developed country. It boasts the world’s second best
Human Development Index, after Norway, and the 10th biggest GDP per
capita. Nonetheless, the economy of Australia is based on ressources.

Over 75% of exports is mineral resources, mainly coal and iron ore, and
precious or industrial metals (see the picture above). In the
circumstances of a global economic crisis, this kind of an export
structure isn’t beneficial to the country’s economy: demand and supply
for those products is affected the most.

scenario for the coming weeks and months.][5]

Still, 84% of the countries importing Australian products belong to the
Asian region. These are China, Japan and South Korea which account for
over 50% of Australian exports. These countries were the first to have
lived through the pandemic. They will be the first to reopen borders and
deal with economic issues. Thus, the demand will be restored faster than
in other regions.

What’s more, according to open sources the aftermath of COVID-19 wasn’t
that severe in Australia. On the whole, the dynamics of new cases looks
optimistic. Still, the Australian government took some of the largest
relief measures per capita, which exceed $130 billion. Considering the
population of 26 million people, it’s $5,000 per each Australian
citizen, including babies and the old. These factors will support the
economy and smooth the crisis.

###  **Technical analysis**

![LiteForex: Fundamental / technical analysis of AUDUSD and actual
scenario for the coming weeks and months.][7]

The long-term fluctuation of [AUD/USD][2] hasn’t been uniform. Starting
from 1972, the [AUD ][2] has seen three global cycles. As the 12-month
cart shows it, there was a 30-year bearish trend first. Then, the
situation steadied and the AUD had been consolidating since 2002. In
2013, the situation changed again and the [AUDUSD ][2] dropped. So, we
are most interested in the latest trend and those [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) support
levels which had defined the rate of [AUD][2].

The first of those important levels formed at around 0.50 [AUDUSD][2] at
the end of 2002. Then, the [Aussie][2]’s trend had been bullish for many
years. That level is still inaccessible and therefore powerful for
bulls.  Another global key level is 0.70 [AUDUSD][2]. This is the
candlestick closing price of the year 2008. Bears haven’t been able to
consolidate below this level for a long time, as the chart suggests.
Only the current active candlestick is below this value.

![LiteForex: Fundamental / technical analysis of AUDUSD and actual
scenario for the coming weeks and months.][8]

Have a look the one-month time frame of [AUDUSD][2] in the chart above.
It provides the details of the latest global bearish channel. A micro-
bearish trend, which started in 2018, is developing in this cycle. This
wave is moving along the upper limit of the bearish channel and has
already gone below the powerful support level at 0.70 [AUDUSD][2]. The
vertical volume indicator shows that the main trade volume has been
concentrated lately in the area of 0.765 [AUDUSD][2]. So, the area of
0.70 - 0.765 is a powerful trading channel which represents now a strong
resistance area for bulls. Also, the chart above shows the TM annual
candlestick’s projection as a grey rectangle. The current price has gone
well below this projection. It means [the Aussie][2] has been oversold.
At the same time, there is no clear evidence of a trend reversal.

![LiteForex: Fundamental / technical analysis of AUDUSD and actual
scenario for the coming weeks and months.][9]

Neither on the weekly chart. I can only see that bulls are willing to
test the upper limit of the channel. The last bullish retracement
neutralized the bearish tension and the [AUDUSD][2] doesn’t look so
oversold now.

###  **Actual scenario**

![LiteForex: Fundamental / technical analysis of AUDUSD and actual
scenario for the coming weeks and months.][10]

The [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) chart above shows how difficult it’s for bulls to reach every
new level. The explanation may be the Central bank’s ultra soft monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/): the rate was cut to 0.25% during the pandemic, which is a
historic record. Even considering a potential demand recovery, bulls
don’t have many chances as low rates increase money supply in the
economy. The Central bank’s active support in the security market and
the government’s relief measures taken into account, I dare suppose that
the bank’s main task will be stabilizing the rate within the current
limits. The width of the channel and the angle of incline allow us to
operate freely in the range of 0.67 - 0.60 [AUDUSD][2].

###  **Long-term forecast for AUDUSD**

![LiteForex: Fundamental / technical analysis of AUDUSD and actual
scenario for the coming weeks and months.][11]

It’s impossible to make optimistic forecasts until the price has left
the bearish channel of the global cycle I’ve mentioned at the beginning
of the article. However, a bearish trend reversal point may be close,
since the resistance levels at 0.70 are clearly seen and the government
wishes to both support the economy and not to devalue the AUD. Most
likely, a reversal will look like a long consolidation and increased
volatility in a flat triangle whose upper limit is the one that crossed
the level of 0.7. The angle of the lower edge is yet to be determined.
On the whole, this scenario looks most probable in the next 2 years.

 **Conclusion**

Long-term prospects of the [Aussie][2] haven’t been obvious yet. I don’t
feel too optimistic about them, but I don’t see any reasons for
panicking either. Quite clear lower and upper limits of the trading
range of 0.67 - 0.60 allow safe narrow-ranged scalping. To do that, a
broker with low commissions and tight spreads is required. I suggest
that you try [LiteForex][12]. What’s more, right now the company is
