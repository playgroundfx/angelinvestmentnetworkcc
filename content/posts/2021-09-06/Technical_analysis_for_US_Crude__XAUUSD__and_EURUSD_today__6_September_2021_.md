Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 06.09.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

Last week, the euro broke out Target Zone 1.1857 - 1.1840 within a
short-term uptrend.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

The oil short-term uptrend continues. The price is being corrected in
the beforementioned uptrend. The target of the correction is to test the
key support zone 67.87 - 67.17. While this zone is being held by buyers,
look for purchases according to the pattern with a target at last week's
high.

If the trend key support is broken out downside, the trend will reverse
down. In this case, look for sales with the target at the lower Target
Zone 65.32 - 64.81.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

Open buy positions according to the pattern in 67.87 - 67.17.
TakeProfit: 70.33. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

Last week, Target Zone 3 1825 - 1820 was reached and then broken out.
The next growth target within the short-term uptrend is Gold Zone 3 1845
- 1843.

It is reasonable to enter purchases on correction at strong supports:
Additional Zone 1823 - 1822 and Intermediary Zone 1813 - 1811. It will
be possible to buy gold after the pattern formation.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

Last week, the euro broke out Target Zone 1.1857 - 1.1840 within a
short-term uptrend. The next growth target is the Gold Zone 1.1936 -
1.1928.

Now a correction and a test of the Additional Zone 1.1865 - 1.1860 can
be seen in the price chart. If the zone is held, then start buying euro
with the first target to update last Friday's high.

If the Additional Zone is broken out, then the correction will continue
with the target in the Intermediary Zone 1.1820 - 1.1812.
