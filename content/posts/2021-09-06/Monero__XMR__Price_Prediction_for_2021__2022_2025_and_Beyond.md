Monero Price Prediction for the Years: 2021, 2023, 2025, 2030, and
BeyondJana Kane

[The Monero (][1][XMR coin][1][) price][1] has recently shown
significant fluctuations like any other cryptocurrency. The crypto’s
future looks bright, making it a relatively reliable addition to
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s' crypto portfolios with a good Monero price target.

The article covers the following subjects:

Due to these price movements, Monero is the 24th coin of all
cryptocurrencies in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of value on Coinmarketcap at the time of
writing. In this article, we'll take a look at [Monero's future
price][1] predictions, covering the basics of the project and ending
with Monero's future price predictions from experts. Want to bet on the
high price expectations of Monero? Why is Monero going up, and is Monero
a good investment? Read on to find out our Monero price prediction!

## What Is Monero?

The digital currency Monero (XMR) has been around since 2014 and has
seen a lot in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of price in recent years. But what is it that makes
Monero so special and distinguishes itself from the other larger and
more famous cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ripple?

How is it that the price of the Monero shows these beautiful upward
lines recently, despite the decline in 2018? Monero is also referred to
as the sleeping crypto giant - and understandably so. In the information
below, we explain why this crypto coin is interesting and why it is
important to keep a close eye on the Monero price.

Monero is the leading cryptocurrency with an emphasis on privacy and
censorship-resistant transactions. Most existing cryptocurrencies,
including Bitcoin and Ethereum, have transparent [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/)s, meaning
that transactions are openly verifiable and traceable to anyone in the
world. In addition, sending and receiving addresses for these
transactions can potentially be linked to a person's real identity.

We have listed a number of important features that make the Monero
future so interesting and distinguish it from the other
cryptocurrencies:

  * Transactions with Monero are confidential and not traceable.
  * The Monero project is 100% decentralized.
  * Monero has a team of more than 240 experienced developers behind it.
  * Monero is scalable because it has no fixed size for a block.
  * Monero transactions are confidential and non-traceable.
  * By default, every Monero transaction hides the send and receive addresses and the amounts processed.

This always-on privacy measure means that any Monero user activity
enhances other users’ privacy, as opposed to selectively transparent
cryptocurrencies (e.g., Z-Cash). Monero is fungible.

This means that Monero is always accepted without the risk of
censorship. The Kovri project will track and encrypt transactions
through I2P Invisible Internet Project nodes. This obscures the IP
address of a transaction and provides further protection against network
surveillance.

Monero is a grassroots community that attracts the world's best
cryptocurrency researchers and tech talent. More than 240 developers
contributed to the Monero project, including 30 core developers. Forums
and chat channels are welcoming and active.

Monero's Research Lab, Core Development Team, and community developers
are constantly pushing the boundaries of what's possible with
cryptocurrency privacy and security.

Monero is not a company. It was developed by cryptography and
distributed systems experts from around the world who donate their time
or are funded through community donations. This means that Monero cannot
be closed by any country and is not limited by any particular legal
jurisdiction.

## Monero in the Past and the History of XMR

Monero has been around for a while. 2021 will be a good year for Monero.
In 2020, the price increased considerably compared to the year before,
but this year seems to be an even better year due to all the new
developments. Read on about the latest Monero [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) and expectations. A
lot has happened in the meantime. It is quite clear that Monero has a
bright future, but first, we'll take a look at what happened with Monero
before that.

### May 2014 - The Start of Monero

On May 21, 2014, Monero was launched on the crypto exchanges. The value
was set at $2.47 under the first name of BitMonero. This is a
combination of the word '' money '' in Esperanto and Bit from Bitcoin.
The coin flopped completely. Fans from the crypto community decided to
take over the project and launched Monero with the current name.

### Early 2015 - Historical Low

The initial appreciation turned out to be way too high. The price
dropped to $0.2130 on January 14, 2015 (Coinmarketcap), which was a
historic low for the currency.

### Late 2016 - Sudden Revival

At the end of 2016, things suddenly went underway. The currency shot to
13.60 dollars. This was the highest valuation of the coin at the time.

### 2017 - Growth Continues

2017 was a fantastic year for Monero. The growth continued and suddenly
reached a rate of around 130 dollars halfway through the year.

### 2017/2018 - Monero Goes Through the Ceiling

All virtual coins exploded, and so did Monero. The coin reached its
[historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) peak of no less than $495.84 (Coinmarketcap, January 7,
2018).

### End of 2018 - Back to Square One

Monero, like many other cryptos, dropped all the way back to the value
of 1.5 years before. With such a rate, many [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s lost some of their
confidence in the coin.

### 2020 - Monero Race: Back on Track

The rate of Monero is back on the rise. After closing 2019 with a
meaningless change, the coin now seems unstoppable. Because it is now
one of the older coins, with a good reputation in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of privacy, the
popularity of the coin is increasing enormously. This can be seen in the
price.

## Monero to US dollar current price rate

### Factors that affect Monero’s rate

The XMR price is mainly dependent on market demand. The rising demand
and popularity of the coin can serve as drivers of the XMR's growth.
Inversely, administrative barriers, additional [regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/), and a decline
in popularity can lead to a potential drop in the cryptocurrency rate.

## Monero Price Predictions by Experts

Let us reflect on the Monero (XMR) price prediction from major distinct
sources, which will give us a fairer idea:

### TradingBeasts

Trading beasts predicted that Monero could reach around $150 ( they
almost got it right!) by the end of 2020, which means that it could
roughly reach about $400 by the end of 2021.

### Crypto Ground

Crypto ground is a cryptocurrency prediction [website](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/website-for-forex-trading/) that also stated
that Monero might be worth $150 at the beginning of 2021. In 5 years,
the XMR coin has a good possibility that it might reach $496.82 and
might even go over the $500 mark if the market is calm enough.

### Oracle Times

Monero is going to be one of the top 3 performing cryptocurrencies in
2021, according to Oracle Times, and the performance might be thoroughly
maintained. Because of the privacy [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), Monero is gaining worldwide
acceptance.

### Wallet Investor

There is a downturn Monero trend predicted and XMR token may lose sheen
by almost half of its current price - stooping to as low as $100.14 by
the first quarter of 2021.

## Monero (XMR) Technical Analysis

To make a realistic forecast for Monero, we need to understand both a
general market picture and ongoing processes. Let's do a technical
analysis of the biggest time frame to determine global market sentiment
concerning the [XMRUSD][2].

The monthly chart above shows quite a short story, but there's a stable
bullish trend suggesting itself for Monero. Note that price growth and
volume growth take place simultaneously. The simultaneous growth of the
XMR price chart and the trading activity indicates that the long-term
bullish trend's potential is quite high, and it might continue in the
coming months.

### XMR Forecast for Next Three Months

To make a short-term forecast, let's do a technical analysis of the
weekly chart and have a more detailed picture.

We'll lay the Fibonacci grid over the upward movement pattern to single
out five development stages of the trend's lifespan:

  * 1 - trend start area and area of bulls' last hope;
  * 2 and 3 - price consolidation zones;
  * 4 - big area of intense growth;
  * 5 - area of peak values.

The Monero to USD price has stopped near the consolidation zone’s upper
limit recently. That's a powerful resistance level that has prevented an
upward movement at least two times this year.

Another important marker is the latest candle formed -- a shooting star
marked with the blue label. Such bars form before a reversal, especially
when they are formed amid relatively low volumes like in our case.

Using indicators, let's look for some more signals of a projected fall
on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) Monero price chart.

The chart above shows that the [RSI][3]'s curve pulled back from the
overbought area's limit the other day. At the same time, the [MACD][4]
histogram points to a bearish divergence. Those signals suggest that the
price may change its direction.

As XMR is in the consolidation area, we are unlikely to see any drastic
moves in the near time. However, the [Monero price][5] is very likely to
go down in the future. It will either reach the trend line at around 190
USD or stop somewhere between areas 1 and 2 in September.

Monero's expected trading range will most likely go from 250 to 350 USD
in the nearest three months.

### Long-Term Monero Analysis for 2021/2022

Let's examine the price [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) and do a more thorough analysis of
XMRUSD to make a realistic forecast for 2021/2022.



Using [[Bollinger Bands](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/bollinger-bands.html) projections][6], I marked projected price
directions and monthly price ranges for 2021 and 2022 on the chart
above.

The [Monero to USD][2] projected value will likely drop to 250 USD and
fluctuate from 250 to 300 US dollars for a while. Monero's bullish
potential is likely to show itself in winter 2022 as it did in spring
2021. The psychological level of 500 USD will be a projected price
target of a new bullish impulse.

As that level is powerful and located near [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) maximums, Monero
won't probably push above it. So, the trend line may be retested after a
subsequent fall, at higher levels at around 300 USD. The table below
presents XMR projected price ranges for the next twelve months.

#### Long-term trading plan for Monero

Here's a trading plan based on long-term analysis.



Monero's projected growth suggests two entry points. If the price
continues moving within the consolidation area, the perfect buy price
will be 250-260 US dollars.

Another trade in [XMRUSD][2] should be opened after a transition to the
area of dynamic development, at the very beginning of momentum, at
around 360 USD.

Stop Loss should be placed below the trading range and the level of 245
USD, in the bulls' last hope area.

The level of 490 USD can be the price target. The price will hardly
break through the level of 500 USD, but it is very likely to come close
to that level.

After a reversal, consider short positions on [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) highs, with the
price target in the consolidation zone and Stop Loss placed a bit above
500 USD. We'll talk about that more thoroughly at the end of the year.

## Long-Term Monero Price Forecast 2025-2030

Many different predictions have been made for the Monero price. How high
can Monero go? How much will it go up in value? In particular, the
growing problems surrounding the privacy of internet users are a big
plus for the project. Many people are starting to value their personal
data more and more, and all financial data is, of course, also part of
this. So, if you’re asking the question: “should I invest in Monero?”
Keep reading.

With Monero, it is therefore very interesting to save your money since
it is not accessible to everyone, even on the [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/).

According to Coinswitch, this could also be the reason for a large price
increase for the Monero future value. If we are to believe the
predictions, which we should always take with a grain of salt, it would,
in any case, be a good addition to your cryptocurrency portfolio for
diversification.

The Monero projected growth for 2021 could be between $400 and $600
($164.31), according to Coinswitch. If only a small percentage of people
are actually going to "protect" their money using Monero, this should be
easy to achieve.

The Monero projected value for 2025-2030 is even higher, at around $900.
With many cryptocurrencies that are only partially anonymous, Monero
knows [how to](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-trading-how-to/) distinguish itself using its XMR. Please note that such a
long-term price prediction and Monero price forecast is very approximate
and is merely speculation.

## How Has the Price of XMR Changed Over Time?

Is Monero expected to rise? On Coinmarketcap, the Monero price today is
$315.64. This value is interactive; you’ll be able to refer to this
article to see the current price tomorrow.

Its all-time high was [$495.84 on January 7, 2018][9] (Coinmarketcap). At the time of writing (February 9, 2021), Monero’s market cap was[][9][$2,845,886,790][9]. But in order to make the most reliable and realistic cryptocurrency predictions, it's important not just to look ahead at the projection but also to look back at the [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) price performance of Monero. Below you can see the chart of how the price [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) of Monero changed over the years of its existence.

## What Is the Future of Monero? Is XMR a Good Investment?

Many [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are concerned that they have entered too late. "With such
a high rate, I will never make more profits." However, this is not
always the case. Let's see if now is a good time to get into Monero.
Monero has gained a big name in the crypto world in recent years. They
are number 1 when it comes to the privacy and security of users. This
added to the Monero growth and Monero supply.

This is a very interesting fact because privacy is becoming an
increasingly important topic. More and more traders are starting to see
the benefits of this coin, and the outlook is therefore also bright.
Especially if you consider the [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/)ly highest price ever - it has
not yet been reached again, and that proves that there is still a lot of
growth in this crypto. [Monero ][1]has a good price target, as it also
moves strongly with Bitcoin.

About Bitcoin, experts say it will rise for a while. Some say
it[][10][will rise to $100,000 in the coming years][10]. This means that
Monero will rise also. Either way, here's a Monero prediction chart for
2021:

Month| Open| Low-High| Close| Mo,%| Total,%  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
2021  
 **Feb**|  137| 137-238|  **204**|  48.9%| 48.9%  
 **Mar**|  204| 166-254|  **237**|  16.2%| 73.0%  
 **Apr**|  237| 193-237|  **207**|  -12.7%| 51.1%  
 **May**|  207| 207-257|  **240**|  15.9%| 75.2%  
 **Jun**|  240| 228-262|  **245**|  2.1%| 78.8%  
 **Jul**|  245| 245-304|  **284**|  15.9%| 107%  
 **Aug**|  284| 281-323|  **302**|  6.3%| 120%  
 **Sep**|  302| 302-369|  **345**|  14.2%| 152%  
 **Oct**|  345| 345-428|  **400**|  15.9%| 192%  
 **Nov**|  400| 365-421|  **393**|  -1.8%| 187%  
 **Dec**|  393| 381-439|  **410**|  4.3%| 199%  
  
Monero has proven itself over the years as a major player in the crypto
market. It is still a very interesting cryptocurrency, despite the
extreme gains in 2020. Monero- buy or sell: this is the real question.
The price still has many growth opportunities.

Because the coin considers the privacy of its users of paramount
importance, it has an advantage over other coins. This is what makes
this coin special. Especially with the high supply of alternative
currencies, this distinctive character is very important.

If you want to start trading Monero, do it with a reputable
exchange/broker. The broker must at least have an internal wallet in
which you must be able to store your coins. A good example of this is
LiteForex. A great reason to create a free demo account on LiteForex!
