Gold: situation is unclear. Forecast as of 06.09.2021Dmitri Demidenko

The [XAUUSD][1] rise against the background of weak US employment data
seems logical. However, when the US dollar is stable and Treasury yields
go up, something is wrong. What exactly? Let us discuss the Forex
outlook and make up a gold trading plan.

## Fundamental gold forecast for a week

Unlike major world currencies, which were actively strengthening against
the USD on expectations of weak US jobs report, gold remained in a
narrow trading range, preferring not to buy the rumor and sell the fact,
but to act according to the situation. As a result, a small increase in
employment led to a rapid [XAUUSD][1] growth to its highest levels since
mid-June. Nevertheless, the unexpected stability of the greenback and
the growth of Treasury yields came as a surprise to the gold buyers.

The return of gold to the levels before the June FOMC meeting, at which
the Fed officials announced a possible hike in the federal funds rate in
2022, is by no means accidental. The Fed's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) and the price
of gold are tightly correlating. Thanks to massive monetary stimulus,
the [XAUUSD][1] bulls managed to set two records in 2011 and 2020.
Rumors of QE tapering provoked breaks of uptrends. In 2021 Treasury
yields are fluctuating in a completely different way than they were
eight years ago. The inability to use old templates causes confusion
among traders.

Indeed, if a 2013 taper tantrum and a surge in Treasury rates
contributed to a strong [XAUUSD][1] decline, now the situation is
different. Jerome Powell's optimism at Jackson Hole and his reluctance
to stop monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) normalization due to the Delta have boosted
global risk appetite, while lowering debt yields and encouraging gold
buyers. On the contrary, weak employment data raised bond rates, which
confused gold.

I believe the reason lies in the QE duration. In 2013, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s
believed that the program would last forever. In 2021 they know that it
will eventually end. As a result, the worse the US data is, the lower
the chances of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) normalization and a slowdown in the US
economy. Treasuries are sold off, yields are going up, the gold price is
dropping.

### Dynamics of gold and Treasury yields

There is one more factor that makes the [XAUUSD][1] rally excessive. The
report is weak only at first glance. Upon closer examination, it becomes
clear that a 10% rise in wages over the past three months exacerbates
the risks of continued high inflation in the long term. This could push
the Fed to raise rates even before the end of QE. In the end, gold
prices do not depend on inflation, as is commonly believed, but on what
Fed officials think about inflation.

Currently, the consensus forecast assumes that in November the central
bank will announce the QE tapering in early 2022. The program is
outdated, and it only fuels the rise in consumer prices. The QE program
should come to an end sooner rather than later. I wouldn't be surprised
if the Fed announces this in September.

### Weekly gold trading plan

Thus, the stability of the USD, further acceleration of inflation in the
US and the rally in Treasury yields allow me to recommend selling gold
on the rise to $1845 and $1860, or on the breakout of support at $1806
per ounce.
