Dollar hits back. Forecast as of 06.09.2021Dmitri Demidenko

The weak growth in US employment should have discouraged the [EURUSD][1]
bears. However, markets grow on [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) and fall on facts. The pair was
jumping up and down when traders started exiting longs. What’s next? Let
us discuss the Forex outlook and make up a trading plan.

## Weekly US dollar fundamental forecast

Last week, I had a feeling that there should soon be a sell-off based on
facts. The euro was actively growing against the US dollar due to the
hawkish tone of the ECB officials and the expectations of weak US jobs
data. The European Central Bank has had reasons to taper the monthly
pace of asset purchases under the PEPP. The euro-area inflation has been
up to 3%. Furthermore, Jerome Powell expressed no concerns about the
Delta variant. Few could expect that August jobs data would be so
disappointing. However, the [EURUSD][1] bulls have been discouraged by
the return of the fears of COVID-19.

Nonfarm payroll growth in August increased by just 235,000, which,
compared to 1.1 million in July and 962,000 in June, looks rather weak.
However, considering that the US GDP fully recovered in the second
quarter, the report could have a different meaning.

### Dynamics of US employment and unemployment

Today, the US economy is about as strong as it has been in generations,
with the tightest labour markets and highest inflation rates seen in
decades. Fed officials claim that high prices are temporary, but the
rise in wages by 0.6% M-o-M and by 4.3% Y-o-Y in August suggests an
opposite situation. Frightened by the Delta, Americans are creating a
labour supply shortage, and employers are forced to raise wages. This
circumstance, coupled with the rise in rents, increases the risks of the
long-term nature of high inflation and is likely to make the Fed taper
QE even at the current employment growth rate.

Yes, the derivatives market cut the chances of a federal funds rate hike
in December 2022 from 66% before Jerome Powell's Jackson Hole speech to
the current 51%. Yes, the Bank of America and other banks argue that
weak jobs data make the Fed unlikely to announce monetary normalization
at the FOMC September meeting. Yes, market expectations are shifting to
November or December, which is bad [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) for the US dollar. Nevertheless,
the [EURUSD][1] bears still have such benefits as high US inflation and
fears of the COVID-19 pandemic. If the Fed puts off monetary
normalization, other central banks should do the same.

The ECB will certainly reduce the pace of asset purchases under the
PEPP, but from a macroeconomic point of view, €80 billion or €60 billion
per month is not essential. The views of the Governing Council on
inflation and the APP are more important. According to Bloomberg
experts, the APP volume will be doubled after March.

### Weekly[ EURUSD][1] trading plan

Therefore, the Fed could put off monetary tightening, but [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s’
concerns could result in a lower risk appetite and a decline in the US
stock indexes. If so, the greenback will strengthen. Furthermore, the
ECB officials at the September meeting could sound less hawkish than in
the case of stronger US jobs data. The likely scenario for the
[EURUSD][1] is consolidation. If the price goes down below 1.186, it
could continue declining to 1.1845 and 1.1825. If the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) close is
above $1.1885, the euro could break through the recent high.
