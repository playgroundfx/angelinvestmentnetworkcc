Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 06.09.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

The Bitcoin seems to have completed the corrective wave. Therefore, the
market should be declining in a new bear trend.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

The BTCUSD market must have completed the long-term corrective wave [B]
composed of three sub-waves (A)-(B)-(C). Therefore, the market should
turn down and start a new downtrend. The first downside target is at
level 48270.00. It is relevant to enter sell trades with the above-
indicated target.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Sell 51727.00, TP 48270.00

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

The XRPUSD market should be forming the linking wave (X). The hourly
timeframe displays the final leg of the (X) wave, impulse wave C. There
should be forming the final sub-wave of the C wave, wave [5]. The first
four waves of wave [5] must have completed, so there should be forming
wave (5). and the price could go up to 1.402. One could enter purchases.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] **** today:

Buy 1.321, TP 1.402

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

The ETHUSD market continues forming the corrective wave B, composed of
sub-waves [A]-[B]-[C]. There is unfolding the final bullish impulse wave
[C]. After corrective wave (4) completed as a flat, the price has
started rising in impulse (5). The Ethereum price should follow sub-wave
5 to a level of 4100.00, where the entire correction B will finish.
Next, there will start a new bear trend.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Buy 3916.50, TP 4100.00
