Economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the week 06.09.2021 – 12.09.2021Jana Kane

##  **Review of the main events of the Forex economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the
next trading week (06.09.2021 – 12.09.2021)**

The dollar fell, while the DXY dollar index, which estimates its value
against a basket of 6 major currencies, lost about 0.7% last week, which
was negative for the dollar for the second consecutive time.

The US Department of Labor report released last Friday showed that the
rate of hiring slowed significantly in August. The economy added 235,000
jobs, which is well below the forecast of +750,000 jobs, although the
unemployment rate dropped to 5.2% (against 5.4% in July and 5.9% in
June). It looks like employers have sharply reduced the rate of hiring
new workers amid the new wave of Covid-19 triggered by the delta strain
of the coronavirus. However, as strange as it may seem, stock market
participants did not seem to be in the least upset, as the weak
employment report means that the Federal Reserve may delay the
curtailing of the stimulus programs. Major US stock indices NASDAQ100
and S&P 500 reached new record highs during a fairly calm (for the stock
market) last week. Reporting season is over, most S&P 500 companies have
already released their second quarterly results, and trading has
traditionally slowed ahead of the long weekend (on Monday, the US stock
and bond markets will be closed for Labor Day).

At the same time, a weak report on the American labor market caused an
increase in gold quotations, which exceeded last Friday 7-week highs
above $1833.00 per ounce, and in the coming days we should expect their
further growth, however, as well as a weakening of the dollar, at least
until the arrival of new macro statistics, allowing to re-evaluate the
prospects for the Fed's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).

Next week, 3 of the world's largest central banks (RB of Australia, Bank
of Canada and the ECB) will decide on their monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).

Market participants will also pay attention to the publication of
important macro statistics from the Eurozone, Japan, China, Germany, and
Canada.

 ***during the coming week, new events may be added to the [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) and
/ or some scheduled events may be canceled**

 ****GMT time**

###  **Monday, September 6**

Banks in the US and Canada are closed for Labor Day. In this regard,
trading volumes will be reduced during the American trading session. No
publication of important macro statistics is planned on this day.

###  **Tuesday, September 7**

###  **04:30 AUD RBA's decision on interest rate. RBA's accompanying
statement**

In March 2020, the RBA made 2 rate cuts, bringing it to the level of
0.25%, and launched a quantitative easing program. At the same time, for
the 3-year government bonds of Australia, the target level of yield is
set at 0.25%. The RBA has launched a lending program for the banking
system in the amount of at least A$ 90 billion.

In early November 2020, the Reserve Bank of Australia lowered its key
rate again, bringing it and the target level of 3-year bonds to 0.10%
from 0.25% and announced a quantitative easing program in the amount of
A$ 100 billion to support the economic recovery of the country.

The main negative factors for the Australian economy are weak wages
growth, a weak labor market and a slowdown in growth. Annual inflation
has remained below the 2% -3% target set by the RBA for four years.

Unemployment in the country has remained above the 5% level for many
years, unwilling to decline. Now the Australian economy is experiencing
difficulties due to the coronavirus pandemic, which has hit the tourism
and transport sectors hard.

It is expected that at this meeting the Central Bank of Australia will
leave the rate at the current level of 0.1%, although unexpected
decisions are not ruled out.

In the accompanying statement, the leaders of the RBA will explain the
reasons for the decision on the rate. If the RBA signals the possibility
of further easing of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) in the near future, the risks of a
fall in the Australian dollar will increase.

###  **09:00 EUR Eurozone GDP for Q2 (final release)**

GDP is considered to be an indicator of the overall health of the
economy. The upward trend in GDP is considered positive for the EUR; a
poor result weakens the EUR.

Recently, macro data from the Eurozone have been indicating a gradual
recovery in the growth rate of the European economy after a sharp drop
in early 2020.

According to economists' forecast, the GDP of the Eurozone is expected
to decrease in the 2nd quarter of 2021 by -0.6% (+13.6% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/))
after falling by -0.3% (-1.3% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) in Q1 2021, -0.7% (-4.9%
YoY) Q4 2020, +12.5% ​​growth (-4.3% YoY decline) in the 3rd quarter, a
fall of -11.8% (-14.7% yoy) in the 2nd quarter and a fall of -3.6%
(-3.1% yoy) in the 1st quarter of 2020. The preliminary forecast was
+1.5% (+13.2% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)).

If the data turn out to be weaker than the forecast, the euro may
decline. Better-than-expected data may strengthen the euro in the short
term.

###  **23:50 JPY Japan's GDP for Q2 2021 (second estimate)**

GDP is considered an indicator of the general state of a country's
economy and estimates the rate of its growth or decline. The report on
gross domestic product published by the Cabinet of Ministers of Japan
expresses in monetary [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) the total value of all final goods and
services produced by Japan over a certain period of time. An upward
trend in the GDP indicator is considered a positive factor for the
national currency (yen), while a low result is considered negative (or
bearish).

In the previous 1st quarter, the country's GDP declined by -0.9% (-3.7%
in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) after growing in the 4th quarter of 2020 by +2.8%
(+11.7% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) and falls in the first half of 2020.

The preliminary estimate implied GDP growth in the 2nd quarter of 2021
by +0.3% or +1.3% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/). The data points to a bumpy recovery
in the Japanese economy after it collapsed due to the coronavirus
pandemic in 2020.

 Nevertheless, the revised forecast implies that in the 2nd quarter of
2021, Japan's GDP grew by +0.4% (+1.6% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)), which is a
moderately positive factor, primarily for the Japanese stock market.

Better-than-expected data is likely to help the Japanese stock market
rally.

###  **Wednesday, September 8**

###  **14:00 CAD Bank of Canada's decision on interest rate. Bank of
Canada's accompanying statement**

The Bank of Canada will decide on the interest rate. In March 2020, the
bank lowered the rate 3 times, bringing it to the level of 0.25%, to
mitigate the economic damage from the novel coronavirus pandemic.

In the accompanying statement, the central bank of Canada said that the
decision is "aimed at supporting the financial system, which plays a
central role in lending to the economy, as well as laying the foundation
that will allow the economy to return to normal." The central bank's
press release also said the spread of the coronavirus and the plummeting
global oil prices are collectively weighing heavily on Canadians and the
Canadian economy.

In fact, quantitative easing and a significant cut in the interest rate
should contribute to the weakening of the national currency.

According to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics in late
August, Canada's GDP contracted 1.1% (year-on-year) in the second
quarter, while economists had forecast a 2.5% rise. Many economists have
lowered their forecast for the growth of the Canadian economy in 2021.

The negative effects of the coronavirus on the Canadian economy and the
country's labor market, as well as the weakness of the housing market,
are putting pressure on the Bank of Canada to further ease monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).

However, the Bank of Canada is expected to keep its interest rate at
0.25% at its meeting on Wednesday.

Tough tone of the accompanying statement by the Bank of Canada on rising
inflation and the prospects for further tightening of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
will cause the Canadian dollar to strengthen. If the Bank of Canada
signals the need for soft monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), the Canadian currency will
decline.

###  **Thursday, September 9**

###  **01:30 CNY Consumer Price Index (CPI)**

The National Bureau of Statistics of China will release another monthly
data reflecting the dynamics of consumer prices in China. The rise in
consumer prices could trigger an acceleration in inflation, which could
force the People's Bank of China to take measures aimed at tightening
fiscal [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). Increased growth in consumer inflation may cause the
appreciation of the yuan, a weak result will put pressure on the yuan.

China's economy, according to various estimates, is already the largest
in the world, pushing the US economy into second place. Therefore, the
publication of important macroeconomic indicators of this country has a
significant impact on world financial markets, primarily on the
positions of the yuan, other Asian currencies, the dollar, commodity
currencies, as well as on Chinese and Asian stock indices. China is the
largest buyer of raw materials and a supplier of a wide range of
finished products to the world commodity market.

In January 2021, the growth of the consumer inflation index amounted to
+1.0% (-0.3% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)), in February +0.6% (-0.2% in annual
[terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)), in May -0.2% (+1.3% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)), and in July +0.3% (+1.0%
in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)).

Deterioration of macroeconomic indicators, including a decrease in
consumer inflation, may negatively affect the positions of the yuan, as
well as commodity currencies such as the Canadian, Australian, and New
Zealand dollars. To a greater extent, this applies to the Australian
dollar, since China is Australia's largest trade and economic partner.

According to the forecast, the consumer price index is expected to grow
by +0.5% in August (+1.1% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)).

The rise in the consumer inflation index will have a positive effect on
the quotes of the yuan, as well as commodity currencies. However, the
data worse than forecast and the relative decline in CPI may negatively
affect them.

###  **11:45 EUR ECB's decision on rates**

The ECB will publish its decision on the key rate and the deposit rate.
The ECB's tough stance on inflation and key interest rates contributes
to the strengthening of the euro, while the soft stance and rate cuts
weaken the euro. In September 2019, the European Central Bank lowered
its key interest rate on deposits by 0.1%, to -0.5%, for the first time
since March 2016, and began buying bonds worth 20 billion euros a month,
renewing the so-called quantitative easing program. According to the ECB
leadership, the balance of risks for the economic prospects of the
Eurozone "is still shifted to the negative side", and "until inflation
is in line" with the target level, which is just below 2%, the rate will
remain low. The new forecasts of the ECB on rates and the QE program can
be viewed as a signal of the inclination to further soften [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) amid
the inflation unwilling to accelerate.

After Brexit, trade conflicts, factors of political instability in
Europe, as well as the growing coronavirus pandemic, due to which
European countries are forced to introduce new quarantine restrictions
that negatively affect economic activity, are the main threats to the
European economy. Back in March 2020, the ECB signaled the possibility
of [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) easing, and the bank's representative admitted that the bank's
management could lower the already negative interest rates even lower.

Probably, following the results of this ECB meeting, the key interest
rate will remain at the same level of 0%. The ECB's rate on deposits for
commercial banks is also likely to remain at -0.5%.

At the same time, there is a possibility that at this meeting the ECB
may signal about the approach to the beginning of the phase of
curtailment of the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP), which
may cause a sharp strengthening of the euro. By the way, some
representatives of the ECB have previously expressed an intention to
tighten [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).

###  **12:30 EUR Press conference of the ECB**

The press conference will be of primary interest to market participants.
In its course, a surge in volatility is possible not only in the euro
quotes, but also in the entire financial market, if the ECB leaders make
unexpected statements. The ECB leaders will assess the current economic
situation in the Eurozone and comment on the ECB's rate decision. In
previous years, based on the results of some ECB meetings and subsequent
press conferences, the euro exchange rate changed by 3% -5% in a short
time.

The soft tone of the statements will have a negative impact on the euro.
Conversely, a tough tone from ECB officials on central bank monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) will strengthen the euro.

###  **16:00 CAD Speech by Tiff Macklem, head of the Bank of Canada**

The Canadian economy, as well as the entire global economy, slowed down
in 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic. Earlier, Tiff Macklem said that
the country's economy is quite stable. However, the situation has
changed rapidly, and not for the better. It will be interesting now to
hear McLeam's opinion on the sustainability of the Canadian economy and
the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the central bank.

If Macklem touches on the topic of the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the Bank of
Canada, the volatility in the quotes of the Canadian dollar will rise
sharply. His tough tone will help strengthen the Canadian dollar. The
soft rhetoric of Macklem's speech and the propensity to pursue a soft
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) will negatively affect the CAD quotes.

He will likely also clarify the interest rate decision recently adopted
by the Bank of Canada and may provide some guidance for [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s ahead
of the next central bank meeting, which is likely to take place next
month.

###  **06:00 EUR Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) in Germany
(final release)**

This index is published by the EU Statistical Office and is calculated
on the basis of a statistical method agreed between all EU countries. It
is an indicator for assessing inflation and is used by the Governing
Council of the ECB to assess the level of price stability. A positive
result strengthens the EUR, a negative one weakens it.

The preliminary forecast for August was: +3.4% (against +3.1% in July,
+2.1% in June, +2.4% in May, +2.1% in April, +2.0% in March, +1.6% in
January and February, -0.7% in December and negative values ​​in the
second half of 2020) in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/). If the data turn out to be better
than the forecast, the euro may strengthen in the short term. The growth
of the indicator is a positive factor for the euro. The data suggests
increasing inflationary pressures in Germany. The data worse than the
forecast and the previous value will negatively affect the euro.

###  **12:30** **CAD Unemployment rate in Canada**

Statistics Canada is to publish data on the country's labor market for
August. Unemployment has risen in Canada in recent months, including
amid massive business closures due to coronavirus and layoffs.
Unemployment rose from the usual 5.6% - 5.7% to 7.8% in March and
already up to 13.7% in May 2020. If unemployment continues to rise, the
Canadian dollar will decline. If the data turn out to be better than the
previous value, the Canadian dollar will strengthen. A decrease in the
unemployment rate is a positive factor for the CAD, an increase in
unemployment is a negative factor. Unemployment is expected to be 7.4%
in August (against 7.5% in July, 7.8% in June, 8.2% in May, 8.1% in
April, 7.5% in March, 8.2% in February, 9.4% in January, 8.8% in
December, 8.6% in November).
