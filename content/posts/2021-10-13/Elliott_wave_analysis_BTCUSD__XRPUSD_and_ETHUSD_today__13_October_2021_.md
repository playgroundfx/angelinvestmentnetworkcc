Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 13.10.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

The XRPUSD market seems to have completed a bearish correction.
Therefore, shortly, BTCUSD and ETHUSD impulse growth is possible.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

Corrective wave [B] continues to develop in the shape of a simple zigzag
(A)-(B)-(C). The first two parts of this zigzag are fully completed, and
the last part is still under development. Two sub-waves 1 and 2 have
been formed as part of the bullish impulse wave (C). Now the final part
of the upward sub-wave 3 is unfolding. The impulse sub-wave 3 is
expected to end at the level of 59500.00. Then, there should be
developing correction 4, as shown in the chart.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 56064.50, TP 59500.00

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

Within the potential double zigzag W-X-Y an upward linking wave X is
currently developing as a simple zigzag [A]-[B]-[C]. Within this zigzag
wave [C] is being developed. It is assumed that the formation of the
bearish correction (4) has come to an end. Therefore, growth within the
final wave (5) to the level of 1.276 is possible shortly. At this level,
wave X will be 76.4% of wave W. Therefore, one could enter long trades.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] **** today:

Buy 1.169, TP 1.276

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

The ETHUSD market continues forming an upward corrective wave B,
consisting of three major sub-waves [A]-[B]-[C]. The first two sub-waves
[A]-[B] are already completed. The market is now in a bullish impulse
wave [C] which consists of sub-waves (1)-(2)-(3)-(4)-(5). Most likely,
the final part of the upward impulse (3) is now developing. Its end is
expected around level 3750.00. After reaching this level, the price may
start moving downward within correction (4). An approximate trajectory
of the future price movement is outlined in the chart.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Buy 3511.24, TP 3750.00
