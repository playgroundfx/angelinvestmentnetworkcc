Analysis for oil, gold, and EUR/USD for 20.05.2020Alex Rodiоnov

## Oil price growth stopped in the resistance zone [30.04 – 29.67]. A
down correction may start

###  **USCrude –** **oil** ****

The oil price has consolidated above Target Zone 3 [26.67 – 25.92]. It
means that the next target for middle-term buy trades is Target Zone 4
[34.17 – 33.42].

The uptrend key support is now in the zone of [19.19 — 18.00].

The local trend is up. Traders were trying to break out Gold Zone [30.04
– 29.67] yesterday, but they failed, the zone was held.

There could start a correction down now and the price could test the
strong supports. After the supports are tested, I recommend looking for
new patterns to buy oil with a target to break through the local high.

AZ and IZ remain in the same zones.

 **[USCrude][3]Trading ideas for today:  **

  1. Buy according to the pattern in Additional Zone [28.19 - 27.89]. TakeProfit: 31.00. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. Buy according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone [25.19 - 24.59]. TakeProfit: 31.00. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

###  **XAUUSD – gold**

Gold middle-term uptrend continues. The price is now trading under the
resistance Target Zone 5 [1757.2 – 1751.2]. If buyers break the
resistance out, the next upside target will be Target Zone 6 [1817.2 —
1811.2].

There is developing a corrective pattern in the hourly chart. The price
is now testing the local resistance Additional Zone [1751.0 - 1748.7].
If there is a sell pattern, I recommend selling gold with a target in
Intermediary Zone [1719.3 – 1714.8].

Otherwise, if AZ is broken out, the price will break through the local
high, and next, consolidate above Target Zone.

 **[XAUUSD][6] Trading ideas for today: **

Sell according to the pattern in the zone of [1752.0 - 1740.0].
TakeProfit: Intermediary Zone [1719.3 - 1714.8]. StopLoss: according to
the pattern rules.

###  **EURUSD – euro/dollar**

The EURUSD is trading in the middle-term uptrend. The upside target is
to break through the local high of May 1 and reach Target Zone 2 [1.1109
– 1.1091]. One can consider buy trades on the 50% correction opposite to
the previous impulse.

![LiteForex: Analysis for oil, gold, and EUR/USD for 20.05.2020][7]

The price has reached Target Zone [1.0966 – 1.0948] on the hourly chart.
Buyers haven’t broken out the zone. The price has started a correction
and tested Additional Zone [1.0930 – 1.0926], which is a strong intraday
support.

The price is now rising up from the AZ. If the rise results in a buy
pattern, we shall buy the euro with a target to break through
yesterday’s high.

If the AZ is broken out, the price should reach Intermediary Zone
[1.0885 – 1.0876]. I also recommend entering purchases in the zone.

 **[EURUSD][9] Trading ideas for today: **

  1. Buy according to the pattern in Additional Zone [1.0930 - 1.0926]. TakeProfit: 1.0975. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. Buy according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone [1.0885 - 1.0876]. TakeProfit: 1.0975. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

> IZ - Intermediary Zone: responsible for the price momentum reversing

>

> TZ - Target Zone: a zone that is 75% likely to be reached after IZ
breakout.

>

> GZ - Gold Zone: zone in the medium-term momentum.

>

> All zones are calculated based on the average [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) price of the
instrument and margin requirements of the futures.
