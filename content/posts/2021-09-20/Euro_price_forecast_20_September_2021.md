Euro broke down. Forecast as of 20.09.2021Dmitri Demidenko

Although Bloomberg experts claim that the Fed will not rush to withdraw
the monetary stimulus, the market movement on the eve of the Fed
September meeting means the opposite. Let us discuss the Forex outlook
and make up a [EURUSD][1] trading plan.

## Weekly euro fundamental forecast

A few days before the FOMC meeting, stock indexes collapsed, Treasury
yields went up, the US dollar rose, and the [EURUSD][1] pair reached the
previously indicated [target of 1.1715][2]. Everything indicates that
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s believe, if not in the announcement of the QE tapering, then
in more hawkish forecasts for the federal funds rate.

Although Bloomberg experts suggest the Fed should announce the tapering
of its $120-billion quantitative easing programme in November, markets
seem to believe that this may happen earlier. In his recent speeches,
Jerome Powell has argued that the inflation target has been met and
progress towards full employment is clear. He said that the first rate
hike should not be linked to the end of QE. So why hold on to a program
that has outlived its usefulness? It was good during the recession, but
now it only accelerates inflation.

Far more than the reduction in monthly asset purchases, the markets are
frightened by the more hawkish FOMC forecasts for the federal funds
rate. Bank of America believes that the number of dots for 2022 and 2023
will remain unchanged, but the Fed will show that in 2024 it will be
ready to raise borrowing costs at three meetings of the Committee.
Standard Chartered predicts that enough officials can shift their
forecasts from 2023 to 2022 to push the consensus estimate to next year.
This circumstance, coupled with an increase in the Fed's inflation
forecasts, will strengthen the US dollar.

It should be noted that expectations of withdrawal of monetary stimulus
are not the only reason that causes the [S&P 500][3] to fall. Fiscal
stimulus cuts have already begun, and the large-scale fiscal expansion
that took place in 2020-2021 could end, leading to a significant
slowdown in the American economy.

### Dynamics of fiscal stimulus’s impact on economic expansion

According to Goldman Sachs, the rate of expansion of US GDP after an
impressive 5.7% in 2021 will decline to 1.5% in 2022. This will resemble
a sideways movement rather than a rise. Large-scale monetary and fiscal
support, as well as impressive corporate earnings and economic growth
reports, have been the main drivers of the stock indexes rally this
year. Many factors have already been priced in stock market quotes,
which encourages [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s to exit longs, leading to a correction in
the[ S&P 500][3] and strengthening the greenback.

Another reason to sell the [EURUSD][1] was the revival of the topic of
trade wars. The UK, US, and Australia have announced a historic security
pact in the Asia-Pacific, the Aukus, in what is seen as an effort to
counter China. Beijing has applied to join the Trans-Pacific Partnership
( _TPP_ _)_. Tensions between the United States and China are mounting,
which could result in new tariffs.

### Weekly [EURUSD][1] trading plan

The [EURUSD][1] has reached the [downside target][2] at 1.1715, and
there is a new target at 1.168. The euro is declining; however, the
outcomes of the FOMC meeting could encourage [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s to buy the pair
on the fact.
