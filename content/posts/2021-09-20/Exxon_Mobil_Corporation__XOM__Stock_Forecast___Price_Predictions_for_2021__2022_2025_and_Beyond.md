XOM Stock Forecast: The Future of Oil and Gas in the Green Energy
EraJana Kane

For many years, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s didn’t have to worry much about the Exxon
Mobil Corp, mainly thanks to the company’s consistently large profits.
But now there are at least two things that are making some [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s
nervous — the demand for clean energy infrastructure and the global
economic slowdown.

The oil giant seems to be slow to react to changes in the energy
landscape, having shown very little interest in investing in renewable
energy up until recently. For the first time in 2021, [Exxon][1]
disclosed the emissions from its products and created a business unit
for carbon emissions-reducing technologies. The question is: will it be
enough?

And in reaction to plummeting fossil-fuel demand, Exxon slashed its
planned capital spending by about a third and cut as much as 15% of its
workforce. Once again: will this improve the firm’s financial outlook?

We’ll find the answers in the numbers. In this article, we’ll be looking
at [XOM][2] stock forecasts to gauge what analyst recommendations and
various publications say about the company’s future. How will Exxon
behave in the short term? How much will Exxon stock be in 10 years?
Learn more about Exxon Mobil stock's future below.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Overview of the XOM Inc. Stock

[Exxon Mobil Corporation][3] is the largest United States corporation in
the oil sector and one of the world’s largest companies by revenue
overall.

 ****

Exxon explores, produces, transports, and sells crude oil and natural
gas. The company also manufactures and markets commodity petrochemicals,
such as olefins, aromatics, polyethylene, and other specialty products.

Here is a short summary for the stock (as of May 26, 2021):

  * Market cap: $246.65 billion

  * Shares outstanding: 4.23 billion

  * Public float: 4.23 billion

  * Earnings per share: -$4.47

  * Yield: 5.95%

  * Dividend: $0.87

  * Ex-dividend date: May 12, 2021

  * Percentage of float shorted: 0.87%

  * Average volume: 27.52 million

The current price for one XOM share is 53.71 USD.

Technically, the company was created in 1999 through the merger of Exxon
(the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey) and Mobil (the Standard Oil
Company of New York). But XOM shares were publicly available long before
then.

Over the course of its [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/), XOM stock split five times.

As you can see, ExxonMobil splits took place at regular intervals. There
could have been another split during the 2007 stock crash, but the oil
bust occurred before Exxon could pull the trigger.

## What Will Drive Exxon’s Price in 2021 and Beyond?

In short, the Exxon stock forecast is heavily affected by the supply and
demand for petroleum-based products, companies' earnings expectations
vs. reported results, and global events.

There are also discussions of a mega-merger between ExxonMobil and
Chevron. The two companies would then produce about 14% of American
petroleum and other similar petrochemicals. If regulators choose to
approve a Chexxon merger, the [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) could make the stock quote skyrocket.

There is one important factor and its effect on the price projection is
something that we want to highlight separately. It’s the ongoing global
shift toward low carbon energy [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/).

There is an ongoing fear that oil and natural gas will start falling out
of use, but with this, timing is key. The shift to solar and wind power
will be too slow to move Exxon out of the picture, solidifying oil- and
natural gas-based stock for quite some time.

But the stock also depends on a positive public image. That’s why the
ExxonMobil Low Carbon Solutions business was launched. The realistic
goal was set to develop innovative, large-scale carbon capture and
storage (CCS) concepts. If carbon neutrality ambitions are met
successfully over the next several decades, the stock price should not
be disrupted by environmentally conscious regulators and activists.

## XOM Price Predictions for 2021: Analysts’ Ratings

Is Exxon stock predicted to go up? Luckily, there are multiple analysts
who have shared their XOM stock projections. The average price target
for ExxonMobil stock across [22 Wall Street analysts][4] is 56.68 US
dollars. Below are seven firms with their most recent “Buy or Sell”
ratings for the rest of 2021.

### Mizuho Securities

 ****

Research analysts at Mizuho recently raised their price target from
$58.00 to $66.00. The brokerage maintained a “Neutral” rating on the
stock.

### Werner Eisenmann, DZ Bank

DZ Bank analyst Werner Eisenmann has a bright XOM stock outlook. He
recently upgraded his rating and recommended “Holding” instead of
“Buying” while also announcing a $67 price target.

### Credit Suisse Group, Manav Gupta

Manav Gupta from Credit Suisse reiterated a Neutral rating. The stock
price target was raised from $66 to $69, citing expectations for better
production growth.

### Truist, Welles Fitzpatrick

Truist analyst Welles Fitzpatrick raised the firm's price target on
Exxon Mobil to $64 from $60. When boosting the price target, he did not
comment on the rating, which was previously set at “Hold”. The analyst
cited the company’s efforts in addressing shareholder and environmental
concerns as it strives to reduce emissions and advance low carbon
technology.

### Bank of America, Doug Leggate

Doug Leggate at Bank of America reissued a “Buy” rating and maintained a
$90 target price for the stock. He also added that the company was
poised for a relative recovery after several years of lagging
performance.

### JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Exxon Mobil has been assigned a $74 price target by stock trading and
investment analysts at JPMorgan Chase & Co. in a recent research note.
The rating remains a solid “Buy”.

### Giacomo Romeo, Jefferies Financial Group

Giacomo Romeo at Jefferies Financial Group reiterated his “Neutral”
rating, with a $55 price target. The impact on the share price was
considered high.

## Exxon Mobil Stock Technical Analysis

Let us start the technical analysis of [Exxon Mobil][2] stock price with
the longest timeframe.

In the monthly Exxon Mobiltechnical chart, there is a clear bearish
trend that started in 2014.

In early 2020, the trend accelerated. Next, the bearish movement stopped
at the support level of 30 US dollars.

The level retest in October 2020 was unsuccessful, after which the price
started rolling up.

However, there is not much potential in the bullish movement. This is
proven by two factors:

In the long term, the most likely scenario suggests the Exxon Mobil rate
should be moving in the range of 64 USD - 30 USD and retest the lower
border.

For more accurate Exxon Mobil stock predictions, I will attach the
[Fibonacci][5] grid to the chart to analyze the trend cycles. As you
see, there can be defined four zones:

  * Zone 1 is the trend start. The price stayed for a long time in the zone and returned to it, which increases the chance of the Exxon Mobil trend reversal.

  * Zones 2 and 3 mark strong price movement. The price doesn’t stay in the zones for a long time, but their borders could be a barrier to a sharp price swing.

  * Zone 4 marks price extremes; there are current extreme values of the trend.

Exxon Mobil Analysis, according to the Fibonacci retracements, suggests
that the bearish trend is not strong, the signs of weakness are:

Therefore, the scenario implying that the Exxon Mobil stock price should
go below 30 USD doesn’t look realistic. Exxon Mobil projected stock
price, following the downtrend, could enter the third zone, which will
be the consolidation zone.

### Exxon Mobil Stock Forecast For Next Three Months

To determine the Exxon Mobil projected stock price in the short term, I
will perform a technical analysis of the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/)[ XOM][2] price chart.

Although the bear trend seems to be strong in the monthly timeframe, the
market situation in the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) chart suggests the price should be trading
flat in the red zone, between the levels of $50 and $60 in the next few
months.

The [MACD][6] indicator and the [RSI][7] are in the equilibrium zone,
there are no signs of the overbought or oversold state of the market.
The XOM price had been trading in the above-indicated zone from February
to June before it consolidated above the red zone, the Exxon Mobil
outlook for consolidation from July to November seems to be quite
realistic.

Therefore, Exxon Mobil projected price will be trading in the range of
50 USD - 60 USD, the trend will be down, and the Exxon Mobil future
value will consolidate in the zone of 40 USD - 50 USD by December.

### Long-Term XOM shares Analysis for 2021/2022

Let us analyse Exxon Mobil price [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) to find the clues and outline
the long-term forecast for the Exxon Mobil value for the next twelve
months.

Having studied the Bollinger Band Width, I marked each month’s reference
highs and lows in the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) Exxon Mobil prediction chart.

Until the spring of 2022, the XOM price chart should be trading down. It
is difficult to predict the exact price target. The Exxon Mobil
projected stock price should stop around level 30 USD. Next, the price
should rebound.

The table below shows the expected Exxon Mobil trading range for each
month.

#### XOM Long-Term Trading Plan

Based on the Exxon Mobil analysis, I suggest the Exxon Mobil stock
predictions and a trading plan for the next twelve months.

According to the most likely scenario, one should enter a short trade on
a correction around the level of 58 USD, marked with a blue line.

A reasonable stop loss is a little higher than the most recent local
high, around 65 USD. This level is marked by the red line in the [XOM
vs. US dollar][2] price chart.

The first target price is 30 USD, so a take profit would be a little
higher; it is marked by the green line.

In the course of the bearish trend, I recommend noting any reversal
signals, as the price will have to break out several [Fibonacci][5]
levels serving as support zones.

To secure your trades after the position starts yielding a profit, I
recommend setting a stop loss in the zero zone and activating a trailing
stop.

Please bear in mind that Exxon Mobil stock predictions for 2025 and
beyond are only estimations. Even with the [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) accuracy we have
from past performance, it should be noted that the stock market can
surprise [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s with large spikes and drastic price drops.

## Recent Performance of the XOM Price

It would be impossible to fit the entire price [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) of the Exxon
Mobil Corporation into our brief report. Over the last 15 years alone,
the [XOM][2] stock has been on an irregular run — the price could surge
to over $100 and then dip below $40. But for now, let’s take a deeper
look into the past year’s timeline.

Why is Exxon's stock down in the beginning of 2020? The fall started
after reported fiscal year earnings missed expectations at the end of
2019. Not only did the quarterly numbers look bad, annual figures did
too. Within a month, the stock dropped from $70 to almost $60.

ExxonMobil’s 2020 plunge was made worse by an all-out oil price war
between Saudi Arabia and Russia in early March of the same year. And, of
course, the pandemic crushed energy demand, not making things any easier
for the sector. All these factors combined made US crude fall to a
negative value for the first time in [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/). Exxon's lowest point of
the year was on March 23 at $30.11.

Despite briefly climbing over the $50 mark in the beginning of June, the
stock fell to $32 by the end of October. Overall, according to Bloomberg
data, Exxon’s loss in market value was one of the worst among US firms
in 2020.

Slowly but surely, the company started to recover. During the first
quarter of 2021, Exxon earned $2.7 billion, which is strong evidence of
recovery. And in the last 6 months, the stock showed a rise from around
$30 to almost $60 per share.

## Conclusion: What Does the Future Hold for XOM?

Is it good to invest in Exxon? Continuous future growth is a
possibility, but you may be more interested in learning how much of a
gain to expect. Let’s round up all the short- and long-term predictions
we’ve covered in this article in one Exxon Mobil stock price forecast.

Energy transitions are going to take a very long time; a full transition
from coal to oil took as long as 47-69 years. Exxon’s take on the future
of the energy industry might not align with what Wall Street likes
today, but it’s not outlandish either. In fact, some [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s like the

projected growth rate in the coming years is on the positive side. After
the pandemic-related description, each quarterly revenue report has put
a smile on [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s’ faces. Overall, Exxon seems to remain a solid
long-term option as it has been a top stock for quite some time.
