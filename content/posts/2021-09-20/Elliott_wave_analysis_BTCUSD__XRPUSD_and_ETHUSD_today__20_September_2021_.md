Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 20.09.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

All three cryptocurrency pairs covered in the article have started
forming descending impulses. Therefore, the prices should be falling.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

The BTCUSD market, after the large corrective wave had completed,
started forming a bearish wave as an impulse. Correction 2 must have
completed as a triple zigzag, so the price should be declining in wave 3
down to a level 41800.00, marked by wave 1. One could enter sell trades
in the current situation.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Sell 45565.00, TP 41800.00

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

The XRPUSD market is forming a down wave, composed of three sub-waves,
that has started after the linking wave (X) completed. Sub-waves 1 and 2
completed, and there is forming the third wave. In the third wave, sub-
waves [1]-[2] have completed, and the price should be declining in sub-
wave [3]. The market should soon reach level 0.805. One could enter
short trades in the current situation

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] **** today:

Sell 0.982, TP 0.805

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

After the long-term corrective wave B finished, the market has started
declining in the bearish impulse wave. The first two elements, impulse 1
and corrective wave 2, composed of sub-waves [W]-[X]-[Y], completed.
There is unfolding the down wave 3 as an impulse [1]-[2]-[3]-[4]-[5], as
outlined in the chart. The Ethereum price should be falling in sub-wave
[3] to a level below 2895.00. One could enter sell trades in the current
situation.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Sell 3161.24, TP 2895.00
