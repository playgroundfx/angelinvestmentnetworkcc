Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 09.02.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

All three cryptocurrency pairs could slightly rise in price in the near
future. Next, the prices should go down. Let us see the market sentiment
of each cryptocurrency in detail.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

The chart displays the final leg of the upward impulse wave. After the
bearish triple zigzag [w]-[x]-[y]-[x]-[z] completed, the price has
started rising again. There is now forming the fifth wave as an impulse
[1]-[2]-[3]-[4]-[5]. The upward wave [3] should soon finish at a level
of around 48500.00. Next, the market could be declining in the
corrective wave [4].

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 46840.50 TP 48500.00

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

After the upward linking wave (X) has finished, the price has dropped.
There is likely to be forming the bearish wave W as a zigzag
[A]-[B]-[C]. The impulse wave [A] has completed, and the correction [B]
is still forming as an upward triple zigzag. The final leg of the triple
zigzag, the sub-wave (z), could end at a level of around 0.490.
Afterward, the price will go down in the impulse.

### Trading plan for **[XRPUSD][2]** today:

Buy 0.455, TP 0.490

## Elliott wave Ethereum analysis

The market has finished the horizontal corrective wave 4 as a triangle
[A]-[B]-[C]-[D]-[E]. Next, the price has started rising in the bullish
impulse 5. According to the internal structure, four out of five legs
have completed within wave 5. The Ethereum price should be rising in the
final impulse wave [v] to a level of 1900.00. Next, the market could
turn down and start declining. One could enter long trades in the
current situation.

### Trading plan for  **[ETHUSD][3] **today:

Buy 1709.97, TP 1900.00
