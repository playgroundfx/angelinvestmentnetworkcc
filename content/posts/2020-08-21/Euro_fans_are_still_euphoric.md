Dollar is like anyone elseDmitri Demidenko

## Is it worth marching against the crowd when the crowd is insane?

Love and hate are just one step apart. The greenback had been extremely
popular for almost 2.5 years, but became of no use this summer. The ECB,
the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan and the SNB said that they would
provide US dollar liquidity auctions only once a week, instead of three
times, because of the low demand.

Goldman Sachs says that the USD lost its status of the main reserve
currency; speculators continue increasing net shorts in the USD index,
and European call [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) at the strike price of $1.28 became popular in
the [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) market. Is the dollar no longer idolized? Well, those who
never loved are 1000 times poorer than those who lost their love.

Everything is growing against the dollar: the euro, which must be
concerned about the expansion of European QE, the British pound, which
is afraid of no-deal Brexit, and the Australian pound, which has to deal
with the closed borders of the infected Victoria state.  Investors may
choose no matter which currency and they won’t lose.

First, the USD index fell on disappointment because the dollar smile
theory was put to the torch. According to that theory, the dollar should
have grown amidst a higher demand for safe haven assets, have fallen on
the Fed’s large-scale monetary expansion, and finally have grown again
amidst the US GDP’s outperformance.

Then, everyone got euphoric about the euro as they suddenly believed
that a deeper economic hole wouldn’t prevent the EU economy from
recovering faster than the US. Bulls in [EUR/USD][2] have the united EU
while bears have to retreat as the Democrats and the Republicans can’t
agree on fiscal stimulus.

The upsurge of the US’and the eurozone’s economies from April’s bottoms
has actually little in common with a true rally. People are spending
money provided under the economic relief programs. The companies making
the most profits are those who sell goods on the Internet or via mobile
applications, i.e. technological companies. It’s the rally of this
sector’s stock that allowed [S&P 500][4] to update its historic highs
and presumed that Wall Street thinks about the future while Main Street
lives in the present. To me, the US stock indexes’ impressive rise
amidst the economy that is only trying to recover looks like a party
that we’ll be ashamed of some day. Still, we eagerly keep in memory
those fabulous evenings that we are ashamed of.

At a closer look, [EUR/USD][2]’s rally isn’t based on the economic
growth divergence. It’s based on the difference in the epidemiological
situations that defines GDP’ future growth rate. At the same time, the
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s that are trying to back-door their way to the North sometimes
behave like madmen. They totally ignore the possibility of another Covid
wave in Europe. How should we feel about this crowd? Just remember:
getting out of a mental hospital isn’t equal to recovering. It just
means you became like anyone else.
