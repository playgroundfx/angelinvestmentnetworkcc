USD/CAD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 21/08/2020 –
28/08/2020Alex Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions from corrections above the
level of 1.3133 with a target of 1.3565 – 1.3780.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
1.3133 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of 1.3030
– 1.2951.

## [USD/CAD][1] is likely to grow. Estimated pivot point is at a level
of 1.3133.

 **Analysis:** An ascending corrective wave of larger degree (B) of 4
has finished developing on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame, and wave (C) of 4
started forming. Presumably, the first wave 1 of (C) formed on the H4
time frame, with wave v of 1 completed inside. Apparently, an ascending
correction is starting to develop as wave 2 of (C) on the H1 time frame.
If the presumption is correct, the pair may be expected to rise to the
levels of 1.3565 – 1.3780. The level of 1.3133 is critical in this
scenario as the breakout will enable the pair to continue declining to
the levels of 1.3030 – 1.2951.
