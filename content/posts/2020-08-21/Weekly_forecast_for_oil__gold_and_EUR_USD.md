Weekly forecast for oil, gold and EUR/USDAlex Rodionov

##  **O** **il price forecast for next wee** **k: USCrude analysis**

The oil price tested the broken-out Target Zone 5 [41.67 – 40.92] from
above this week. Next, there was a good reaction of buyers to the
support test. As a result, the price went up and is now trading close to
local highs.

For next week, I recommend holding the purchases entered in TZ5 at the
breakeven with a target in Target Zone 6 [49.17 – 48.42].

Alternative scenario: the price correction down to the trend key support
[37.23 – 36.61]. In this case, we shall also enter long trades; the
target will be at the high of August.

##  **Gold** **price forecast for next wee** **k:** **XAUUSD**
**analysis** ****

The gold price has broken out Target Zone [1957.9 – 1949.2] this week.
According to the methodology, the middle-term trend has again turned up.
However, considering technical analysis, I can’t recommend buying gold.

It is clear from the chart that sellers started a strong down momentum
last week. All the price rise looks like a correction.

Therefore, I recommend expecting the breakout of Target Zone [1922.4 –
1913.1]. If so, we can enter sell trades with a target in Target Zone 2
[1829.4 - 1820.1].

One could buy gold only provided that there is a buy pattern.

TakeProfit: 1864.0, Target Zone 2 [1829.4 - 1820.1]. StopLoss: according
to the pattern rules

##  **E** **uro/dollar price forecast for next wee** **k:** **EURUSD**
**analysis** ****

The EUR/USD has been working out the main upward scenario from Target
Zone [1.1733 - 1.1715]. The local high was broken through. Traders tried
to consolidate the price above Target Zone 4 [1.1914 – 1.1896], but hey
have failed. Only one US session closed the price above, but we need two
US session to confirm the breakout according to the methodology.

The price is now being corrected. This week, traders tried to draw the
price down to the trend key support [1.1783 - 1.1765].

The test of the key support will allow us to enter new euro purchases
according to the pattern with that the target at the high of August.

Buy according to the pattern in Target Zone [1.1783 - 1.1765].
TakeProfit: 1.1960. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.
