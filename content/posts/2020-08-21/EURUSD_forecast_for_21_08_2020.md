EUR/USD forecast: Euro took up mathDmitri Demidenko

## Fundamental Euro forecast for today

### Open EUR/USD position according to the euro-area PMI data

Financial markets base on mathematics. The divergence in the economic
growth, having supported the [EUR/USD][1] bulls during the summer,
looked like an equation with one unknown. A better epidemiological
situation in Europe than in the USA has almost convinced [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s that
the euro-area economy will be recovering faster than the US GDP. As a
result, the rise of the major currency pair depended on the US economic
data. A better economic performance, together with the Fed’s
unwillingness to ease its monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) (which signals hidden
optimism), sent the euro down to $1.18. However, once there appeared
some negative, the euro bulls went ahead.

The US jobless claims are again back to a level of above 1 million, the
manufacturing PMI data reported by the New York Fed and Philadelphia Fed
are weak. These reports show that the US economy is not revering as
rapidly as the dollar buyers would like. I have many times stressed that
the market turns out to be more fundamental amid the interest rates of
the world’s leading central banks, which are close to zero. Investors
are quite responsive to the reports on the US domestic data, especially
since the US economy has been that unknown in the growth- gap equation.

The experts’ projections for the euro-area economy have been optimistic.
In my opinion, too optimistic. Since the French-German stimulus plan was
adopted, the euro risk reversals have been up by 60-80 basis points. The
indicator has increased so rapidly only three times since the records
began in 2006, and each time, the [EUR/USD][1] was up by 5% and more in
a few net months. There is an increased demand in the [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) market for
call [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) with strikes of 1.22, 1.23, 1.25, and even 1.28.

Investors completely forgot that an equation with one unknown could
transform at any moment into an equation with two unknowns. In Europe,
the second wave of the pandemic unfolding. In Spain, about 4,800 new
COVID-19 cases are registered per day, which is the highest since April;
in France, the number of coronavirus cases has increased by 50% in a
week, in Germany, the figure has exceeded 1,500, the highest since early
May. Yes, European relative indicators still fall short of the US, where
150 cases for 1 million of the population (in problematic Spain, there
are 110 cases for 1 million), Yes, most infected are young people.
Hence, the number of hospitalizations and deaths is small, but who knows
how the situation will develop further?

The difficulties will increase amid the expiration of programs to retain
the non-working population in the labor force, which could result in a
surge in unemployment and weigh on the consumer activity. The ECB
stressed this problem at its July meeting, the central bank is willing
to expand QE if necessary. It is a bearish factor for the [EUR/USD][1],
but traders ignored it. The euphoria about the euro is still present and
could end up bad for the euro buyers. The uncertainty about the euro-
area economic recovery increases the risk that the euro will roll down
to $1.18 if the euro-area PMI data for August are weak.
