XAU/USD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 21/08/2020 –
28/08/2020Alex Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider short positions from corrections below the
level of  2014.71 with a target of 1862.02 – 1822.71.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
2014.71 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 2130.03
– 2200.00.

## The pair [XAU/USD][1] remains likely to fall. Estimated pivot point
is at a level of 2014.71.

 **Analysis:** The ascending third wave of larger degree (3) presumably
continues developing on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame, with wave 5 of (3) forming
inside. Apparently, the third wave of smaller degree iii of 5 has formed
on the H4 time frame and a local correction continues developing in the
form of wave iv of 5. On the H1 time frame, presumably wave (b) of iv
finished forming and wave (c) of iv is developing. If the presumption is
correct, the pair may be expected to continue falling to the  levels of
1862.02 – 1822.71. The level of 2014.71 is critical in this scenario as
the breakout will enable the pair to continue growing to the levels of
2130.03 – 2200.00.
