Euro got a blank check. Forecast 11.12.2020Dmitri Demidenko

The ECB couldn’t discourage the [EURUSD][1] bulls. The euro rolled up to
the highest levels since the spring of 2018 and is about to continue the
rally. Let us discuss the Forex outlook and make up a trading plan.

## Monthly euro fundamental forecast

Compromise is not always the best way to solve a problem. Unlike Mario
Draghi, who suppressed the Governing Council’s hawks with his authority,
told the market what he considered necessary, and thus manipulated the
euro as he wanted, Christine Lagarde prefers to convey to [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s the
collective position of the ECB. She said the Pandemic Emergency Purchase
Programme (PEPP) might not be utilized in full scale, which sounded
similar to Jens Weidmann and his supporters' speeches. The hawkish tone
of Lagarde’s comments at the press conference following the ECB December
meeting sent the [EURUSD][1] up to the zone of 2.5-year highs.

Of course, the ECB couldn’t have broken the euro uptrend, but at least
it could have tried to press it down a little. In fact, the forecasts
are too gloomy, and the actions are expected. The European Central Bank
lowered its forecasts for 2021. The expected GDP growth is down from 5%
to 3.9%; the expected inflation rate is down from 1.3% to 1.1%. Lagarde
expects the euro-area economy to contract 2.2% in the fourth quarter. At
the same time, the expansion of the emergency asset purchase program by
€ 500 billion, as well as the extension of PEPP until the end of March
2022 and LTRO until the end of June 2022, have not surprised [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s
at all. On the contrary, some of them expected that both programs' [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)
would be extended by twelve months. Extension by nine months is further
evidence of Christine Lagarde's compromise with the hawks.

Considering the December adjustments, the ECB’s monetary stimulus will
exceed € 3 trillion this year. The central bank is actually targeting
the bond yields of the EU countries; that is, it gives a blank check to
the EU governments. They could borrow money, and the ECB will pay the
debts.

Germany and other EU countries actively use ECB programs. Through an
agreement with Budapest and Warsaw, Berlin found a way to reverse the
veto of Hungary and Poland on approving a € 1.8 trillion fiscal stimulus
package, including the € 750 billion post-pandemic recovery fund. The
approval of programs by the European Union is an important milestone in
the development of the united Europe. The risk of the euro area breakup
is down to almost zero. Furthermore, a massive fiscal stimulus will
support further integration of European countries and transition to a
low-carbon economy _._ __

### Monthly[EURUSD][1] trading plan

The current situation is similar to the market sentiment in the May-
August period. At that time, the ECB officials suggested a potential
yield control [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) and launched the post-pandemic recovery fund.
Besides, the recovery of the US stock indexes encouraged the EURUSD
bulls to start a rally up. Now, [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) not only repeats itself but
rhymes as well. The [EURUSD][1] buyers ignore Boris Johnson's promises
to withdraw the UK from the EU with or without a deal. The bulls do not
pay any attention to the [S&P 500][2] correction amid the absence of the
compromise on the fiscal stimulus in US Congress. The euro is rallying
up to the targets at $1.224 and $1.23, and we can enjoy the victory and
pick up corrections.
