EURUSD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 11.12.20 – 18.12.20Alex
Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions from corrections above the
level of 1.2059 with a target of 1.2250 – 1.2400.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
1.2059 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of 1.1919
– 1.1800

 **Analysis:** Daily time frame: presumably, the first wave of larger
degree 1 of (3) continues developing, with wave iii of 1 formed inside.
On the H4 time frame, a local correction has been formed as the fourth
wave iv of 1, and wave v of 1 is forming. Apparently, the third wave of
smaller degree (iii) of v is developing on the H1 time frame, with wave
iv of (iii) completed and wave v of (iii) still forming inside.  If the
presumption is correct, the pair will continue to rise to the levels of
1.2250 – 1.2400.  The level of 1.2059 is critical in this scenario. Its
breakout will allow the pair to continue falling to the levels of 1.1919
– 1.1800.
