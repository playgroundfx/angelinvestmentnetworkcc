GBPUSD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 11.12.20 – 18.12.20Alex
Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions from corrections above the
level of 1.3190 with the target of 1.3600 – 1.3700.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
1.3190 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of 1.2910
– 1.2679.

 **Analysis:** Daily time frame: presumably, the first wave of larger
degree (1) continues developing, with wave 3 of (3) formed inside. On
the H4 time frame, there is the fifth wave 5 of (3) developing, with
wave iii of 5 forming inside. On the H1 time frame, a local correction
appears to be finishing its development as wave iv of 5, and wave (с) of
iv will soon be completed inside of it. If the presumption is correct,
the pair will continue to rise to the levels of 1.3600 – 1.3700. The
level of 1.3190 is critical in this scenario as its breakout will enable
the pair to continue declining to the levels of 1.2910 – 1.2679.
