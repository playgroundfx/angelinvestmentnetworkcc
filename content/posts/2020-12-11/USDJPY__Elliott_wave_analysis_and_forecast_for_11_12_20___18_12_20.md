USDJPY: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 11.12.20 - 18.12.20Alex
Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 104.76 with a target of 102.50 – 101.11.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
104.76 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 106.39 –
107.36.

 **Analysis:** Daily time frame: presumably, a correction of larger
degree is completed in the form of wave (B). Wave (С) started to form,
with the third wave 3 of (C) developing inside. H4 time frame: wave (i)
of iii of 3 has been formed and an ascending correction is completed in
the form of wave (ii) of iii of 3. Apparently, wave (iii) of iii
continues forming now on the H1 time frame, inside which wave of smaller
degree i of (iii) is formed, correction ii of (iii) is completed and
wave iii of (iii) is developing. If the presumption is correct, the pair
will continue to drop to the levels of 102.50 – 101.11. The level of
104.76 is critical in this scenario as the breakout will enable the pair
to continue growing to the levels of 106.39 – 107.36.
