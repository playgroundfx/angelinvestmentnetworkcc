XAUUSD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 11.12.20 - 18.12.20Alex
Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 1874.72 with the target of 1759.75 – 1718.57.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
1874.72 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 1965.30
– 2014.94.

 **Analysis:** Daily time frame: presumably, the ascending third wave of
larger degree (3) formed, and a descending correction is now developing
as wave (4). The wave of smaller degree А of (4) appears to have formed
on the H4 time frame, and a local correction finished developing as wave
В of (4). H1 time frame: there is wave C of (4) developing, with wave
iii of С formed and ascending correction completed as wave iv of C
inside. If the assumption is correct, the pair will continue falling to
the levels of 1759.75 – 1718.57. The level of 1874.72 is critical in
this scenario, as the breakout will enable the pair to continue rising
to the levels of 1965.30 – 2014.94.
