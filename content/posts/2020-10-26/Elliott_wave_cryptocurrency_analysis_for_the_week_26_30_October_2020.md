Medium-term forecast for five cryptocurrencies as of 26.10.2020Roman
Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a medium-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, EOS, and Ripple. I offer
trading signals for each cryptocurrency pair.

I expect all major cryptocurrency pairs to rise during the coming
trading week.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

 ****

On the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) BTCUSD timeframe, we see that at the end of 2017, the
bullish impulse wave 3 was completed, followed by the development of a
large correction 4. Most likely, wave 4 will take the form of a double
zigzag [W]-[X]-[Y]. As part of this pattern, wave [W] was built in the
form of a zigzag, and now the final part of the linking wave [X] is
developing, it is a double zigzag (W)-(X)-(Y). The sub-wave (Y), like
the subwave (W), is a standard zigzag. Consider the sub-wave (Y) on the
H8 timeframe.

The zigzag-looking wave (Y) consists of three main sub-waves A-B-C.
Bullish wave A in the form of a five-wave impulse has been fully
completed. Most likely, the corrective wave (B) has also been completed,
it is a contracting triangle. Now the middle part of the final impulse
wave C is developing, that is, the impulse [3] is forming. The end of
the indicated impulse will be near the level of 13760.00, then, after a
small pullback in the corrective wave [4], the growth will continue in
the wave [5] towards the level of 15200.00.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] for the week:

Buy 13076.50, TP 13760.00

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

 ****

Ethereum continues to develop a large triple zigzag consisting of sub-
waves (W)-(X)-(Y)-(X)-(Z). Recently, the second actionary wave (Y) of
the indicated pattern has been completed, then the market began to
rapidly decline, forming the first part of the linking wave (X). Most
likely, wave (X) will have a standard A-B-C zigzag shape. Let's take a
closer look at the last part of the chart on the H8 timeframe.

The downward impulse wave A was fully completed, then the development of
corrective wave B began, it is now taking the form of a double zigzag
[W]-[X]-[Y]. It is likely that the double combination will soon complete
its development. We are now at the end of the impulse wave (c). Most
likely, the growth will continue to the level of 443.00, then the market
will reverse and start moving down in a new bearish trend. At the
indicated level, the correction B will be 76.4% of impulse A.

### Trading plan **[ETHUSD][2] **for the week:

Buy 405.49, TP 443.00

##  **Elliott wave Litecoin analysis**

 ****

Litecoin continues the development of the global corrective wave B,
consisting of sub-waves [W]-[X]-[Y]-[X]-[Z] and taking the form of a
complex triple zigzag formation. On the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) timeframe, we see that
after the end of the second linking wave [X], the price began to decline
in the last wave [Z], which, judging by the structure, takes the form of
a double zigzag (W)-(X)-(Y). At the moment, the final wave (Y) is being
formed. Let's look at it on a smaller timeframe.

Wave (Y) is a simple zigzag A-B-C. Wave A is a bearish five-wave
impulse, wave B is a correction in the form of a standard zigzag, inside
which an impulse wave [C] is developing. Most likely, the growth will
continue to the level of 62.50, at which correction B will equal 76.4%
of impulse C, then the cryptocurrency pair will begin to decline in the
final impulse C, as shown in the chart.

### Trading plan for **[LTCUSD][3]**  for the week:

Buy 57.95, TP 62.50

##  **Elliott wave EOS analysis**

 ****

The EOSUSD cryptocurrency pair is developing a correctional wave B. Its
development has lasted for more than two years. The current structure of
the indicated correction looks like a bearish triple zigzag, which
consists of five sub-waves [W]-[X]-[Y]-[X]-[Z]. We see that four parts
out of five are already fully completed, and at the moment the market is
moving down in the last wave [Z]. Wave [Z], like other actionary sub-
waves [W] and [Y], is a simple zigzag (A)-(B)-(C). Let's look at this
zigzag on the H8 timeframe.

The downward zigzag (A)-(B)-(C) was built in half. We saw a bearish
impulse wave (A) followed by an upward corrective wave (B). Correction
(B) will likely take the shape of a double zigzag W-X-Y. The W and X
waves have already been formed, and the Y wave has recently started
developing. During this trading week, we could see the price rise in the
indicated wave towards the level of 3.33. At this level, the entire
correction (B) will be 61.8% of the impulse wave (A).

### Trading plan for **[EOSUSD][4]**  for the week

Buy 2.69, TP 3.33

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

 ****

A descending triple zigzag consisting of sub-waves [W]-[X]-[Y]-[X]-[Z]
is developing. The first four parts of this zigzag have been completed.
At the moment, the last wave [Z] is developing, it is a simple bearish
zigzag, consisting of sub-waves (A)-(B)-(C). Let's consider its
structure on the H8 timeframe.

In the last section of the chart, there is a downward zigzag developing,
inside which the bearish impulse wave (A) was fully completed, and a
corrective wave (B) then started developing. It is likely that
correction (B) is a triple zigzag. In the short term, we could see the
current wave Z completing the correction near the level of 0.273. At
this level, wave (B) will be 50% of impulse (A).

### Trading plan for **[XRPUSD][5]** for the week:

Buy 0.255, TP 0.273
