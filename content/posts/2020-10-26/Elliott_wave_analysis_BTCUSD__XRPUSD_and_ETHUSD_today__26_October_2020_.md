Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 26.10.2020Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I suggest entry signals
to trade each cryptocurrency.

Ripple and Ethereum are developing the final parts of upward
corrections. In the short term, the price is expected to rise to the
indicated levels, then new downtrends may develop.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

 ****

In the last part of the chart, we see the construction of an upward
impulse wave C, which can complete the large linking wave [X].  The
fourth part of the bullish impulse wave [3] is currently under
development. In the near future, the corrective movement in wave (4)
could be completed, after that, the market may rise in wave (5) to the
level of 13760.85. A possible future movement is shown on the chart.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 13125.25, TP 13760.85

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

 ****

Ripple continues to move within the corrective wave B, which is part of
a simple downward zigzag. Correction B takes the form of an upward
triple zigzag [W]-[X]-[Y]-[X]-[Z]. The actionary sub-waves [W] and [Y],
as well as the linking waves [X] and [X] have been fully completed, and
the sub-wave [Z] is still developing. Most likely, wave [Z] will be a
double zigzag (w)-(x)-(y). In the short term, the cryptocurrency pair is
expected to rise in the final wave (y) of [Z] to the level of 0.273.

### Trading plan for **[XRPUSD][2]** today:

Buy 0.255, TP 0.273

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

 ****

Ethereum, like Ripple, is developing a bullish correction B in a simple
downward zigzag A-B-C. Corrective wave B here is a double zigzag
[W]-[X]-[Y]. The first two parts of this double combination have been
fully completed, and now the market is moving upward, building the final
wave [Y], which is a zigzag (A)-(B)-(C). It seems that the impulse wave
(C) will soon be completed, as its correction [4], which is a double
zigzag, has been completed, and now the first part of wave [5] is
developing. In the near future, the price is expected to rise to the
level of 430.00.

### Trading plan for  **[ETHUSD][3] **today:

Buy 407.81, TP 430.00
