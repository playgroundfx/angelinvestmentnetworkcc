Economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the week 18.05.2020 – 24.05.2020Jana Kane

##  **Overview of the main events of the Forex economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the
next trading week 18.05.2020 to 24.05.2020**

 **Trading on key Forex [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/): we are expecting the publication of
important macro statistics from Japan, Australia, the UK, Germany,
Canada, the Eurozone, the US, as well as speeches by the Fed Chairman
Jerome Powell in Congress.**

Last week showed that [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are still worried about the growing
trade tension between the US and China, as well as the likelihood of a
second wave of the epidemic, which has already damaged the global
economy.

Investors' concern is expressed in the fall of US and world stock
indices, which resumed last week, and in the growth of gold quotes,
which came close to $1,750.00 an ounce and exceeded the 7-year maximum
reached in April last Friday. Investor concerns intensified last
Wednesday, following the statements by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell that
the economy may require additional fiscal support. "The current economic
downturn has been the worst since World War II," Powell said.
"Additional fiscal support can be expensive, but worth it if such
measures help avoid long-term economic damage and recover faster." He
also spoke out against negative interest rates.

Current evidence suggests that recovery from the crisis caused by the
coronavirus pandemic will take longer than anticipated.

The dollar is also in demand as a defensive asset. By the end of last
week, the dollar strengthened again, and the DXY dollar index rose
another 0.6% over the week (about 60 points), to around 100.40 at the
end of the trading day last Friday.

Particularly noticeable was the strengthening of the dollar against
major commodity currencies, such as Canadian, New Zealand and Australian
dollars against the backdrop of rising oil prices. Those, in turn,
received support after the OPEC monthly report, which demonstrates the
firm intention of the oil cartel to continue to control the supply. The
International Energy Agency (IEA) in its monthly report also softened
some of its most pessimistic forecasts. The oil market seems to be set
for further growth.

Next week, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s will pay attention to the publication of important
macro statistics from Japan, Australia, Great Britain, Germany, Canada,
the Eurozone, the US, as well as the speech by the Fed Chairman Jerome
Powell in Congress.

 _ **Traders should pay attention to the following significant
macroeconomic data expected next week:**_

 *** during the coming week new events may be added to the [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) and
scheduled events may be canceled**

 ****** **GMT time**

###  **Sunday, May 17**

###  **23:50 JPY Japan's GDP for the 1st quarter of 2020 (preliminary
release)**

GDP is considered an indicator of the general state of the country's
economy that estimates its growth or decline. The report on gross
domestic product published by the Cabinet of Ministers of Japan
expresses in monetary [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) the total value of all final goods and
services produced by Japan for a certain period of time. The growing
trend of the GDP indicator is considered a positive factor for the
national currency (yen), and a low result is considered negative (or
bearish).

In the previous 4th quarter of 2019, the country's GDP fell by -1.8%
(-7.1% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) after growing by +0.4% (+1.8% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/))
in the 3rd quarter . It is expected that Japan's GDP in the 1st quarter
of 2020 decreased by -1.2% (-4.6% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)).

The data indicate a significant slowdown in the Japanese economy since
the end of 2019, and this is a negative factor for the yen and the
Japanese stock market.

If the data turn out to be even weaker, then the yen may drop
significantly in the short term. Data better than forecast can
strengthen the yen (in the short term).

###  **Monday, May 18**

No important macro statistics planned to be released.

###  **Tuesday, May 19**

###  **01:30 AUD Minutes of the May meeting of the Republic of
Australia**

This document is published two weeks after the meeting and the decision
on the interest rate. If the RBA positively assesses the state of the
labor market in the country, the GDP growth rate, and also shows a
hawkish attitude towards the inflation forecast in the economy, the
markets regard this as a higher probability of a rate increase at the
next meeting, which is a positive factor for the AUD. The bank’s soft
rhetoric regarding, above all, inflation puts pressure on the AUD.

At the meeting on May 5, the central bank maintained its current
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) unchanged. The key interest rate of the RBA was kept at
a record low level of 0.25%, and the target level of yield on 3-year
government bonds was also left at 0.25%. The decision to lower the rate
and determine the current target level of government bond yield was made
at an unscheduled meeting of the RBA on March 19 in order to support
Australian business and citizens amid the rapid spread of the
coronavirus pandemic. The government was also forced to introduce a
social distancing regime, suspend enterprises and close borders for
international traffic.

According to many economists, Australia is on the verge of the first
recession in the economy in 30 years.

“Substantial uncertainty remains regarding the short-term prospects of
the Australian economy. In April-June, a very strong decline in GDP is
expected, as well as unemployment growth to a multi-year high,” said the
RBA Governor Philip Lowe after one of the bank’s last meetings. Lowe
also promised that "the board will not raise rates until there is
progress in ensuring full employment and confidence in stabilizing
inflation in the target range of 2-3%." According to him, “there are no
serious arguments in favor of tightening monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) in the short
term,” and “it will be some time before interest rates are raised.”

Nevertheless, if the published minutes contain unexpected information
regarding issues of the RBA monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), then the volatility in the
AUD quotes will increase.

###  **06:00 GBP Report on the average wages of the British citizens
over the past 3 months. Unemployment rate**

Every month, the UK National Office of Statistics (ONS) publishes a
report on average wages, including a period for the last 3 months, with
and without bonuses.

This report is a key short-term indicator of the dynamics of changes in
the level of wages of employees in the UK. Wages growth is a positive
factor for the GBP, and a low value of the indicator is negative.
Forecast: the May report suggests that the average wages with bonuses
have grown over the last 3 months (January-March) by 2.7% (against
+2.8%, +3.1%, +2.9% , +3.2%, +3.2% in previous periods); without bonuses
- by 2.7% (against +2.9%, +3.1%, +3.2%, +3.4%, +3.5% in previous
periods). This is still positive data despite the fact that they are
below the average values. If the data are better than expected, the
pound is likely to strengthen in the foreign exchange market.

Also at this timethe office publishes data on unemployment in the UK.
Over the 3 months from January to March, unemployment is expected to be
at 4.4% (against 4.0%, 3.9%, and 3.8% in previous periods). Since 2012,
the unemployment rate in the UK has been steadily declining (from 8.0%
in September 2012). This is a positive factor for the pound.

If the data from the UK labor market turn out to be worse than the
forecast and/or the previous value, then the pound will be under
pressure.

In any case, at the time of publication of data from the British labor
market, volatility is expected to increase in pound quotes and on the
London Stock Exchange.

###  **09:00 EUR ZEW Indicator**   **of**   **Economic Sentiment in
Germany**

This index reflects the difference between the share of optimistic and
pessimistic [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s, thus assessing the mood of [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s and
businesses. The growth of the indicator and its positive value indicates
an optimistic attitude of [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s, which is a bullish factor for the
EUR. Conversely, a decrease in the indicator and its negative value is a
negative factor for the EUR. In February, the indicator value was 8.7
(against 26.7 in January, 10.7 in December), and in March it was already
-49.5 (with a forecast of -23.4), although in April it unexpectedly
improved to 28.2. Forecast: the indicator in May will be at 33.5, which
is likely to support the euro in the short term. If the data turn out to
be worse than the forecast and the previous value, then the euro will
decrease even more significantly.

###  **14:00 USD Speech by the Fed Chairman Jerome Powell in Congress**

The Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will speak in Congress on economics and
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). His comments may affect both short-term and long-term
USD trading if he again touches on the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the Fed. A
more hawkish position regarding the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the Fed is seen
as positive and strengthens the US dollar, while a more cautious
position is assessed as negative for the USD.

If he makes unexpected statements, the volatility in trading in
financial markets may increase. Any hints to the need for an even softer
central bank [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) will cause the dollar to fall and the US stock
markets to rise.

Participants in the financial market will carefully study his speech in
order to catch signals regarding the Fed’s further actions.

###  **Wednesday, May 20 Мая**

###  **01:30 CNY Bank of China's interest rate decision**

Since May 2012, the People’s Bank of China has been steadily lowering
the interest rate to support Chinese manufacturers. The last time in
2020 the bank lowered its interest rate in April (by 0.20% to 3.85% at
the moment).

In recent months, in the context of international trade conflicts and a
slowdown in the global economy, the world's largest central banks are
moving towards easing their monetary policies in order to support
national economies and increase the competitiveness of goods exported
from these countries.

The People's Bank of China is also in line with this process. The
depreciation of the yuan has become particularly relevant in the last 2
years, when the confrontation between the two most powerful economies in
the world began. One of the measures to mitigate the negative
consequences of increased duties on the import of Chinese goods into the
United States was the depreciation of the national currency of China.
Such a measure was called, inter alia, to maintain the previous volumes
of imports of Chinese products to the United States, which would cost
American buyers less due to the difference in the exchange rates of
national currencies of the United States and China.

Now there is another strong negative factor - the coronavirus pandemic.

It is likely that at this meeting, the People’s Bank of China will keep
the interest rate at the same level of 3.85%, although a reduction in
the rate is also possible.

However, if the People's Bank of China makes unexpected statements or
decisions, then volatility may increase in the entire financial market.
Investors will also be interested in the bank’s assessment of the
consequences of coronavirus for the Chinese economy and its [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) in
the near future in this regard.

###  **06:00 GBP Consumer Price Index. Core Consumer Price Index**

Consumer Price Index (CPI) reflects the dynamics of retail prices for a
group of goods and services that are part of the British consumer
basket. The CPI is a key indicator of inflation. Its publication causes
major movement of the pound in the foreign exchange market, as well as
the London Stock Exchange Index FTSE100.

In the previous reporting month (in March), consumer inflation (in
annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) grew by 1.5% (against 1.7% in February).

Forecast for April: +0.9% (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)). This value is unlikely to
support the pound. An indicator below the forecast may trigger the
weakening of the pound, as low inflation will force the Bank of England
to maintain a soft monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).

Core CPI is published by the Office of National Statistics and
determines the change in prices of a selected basket of goods and
services (except food and energy) for a given period. It is a key
indicator for assessing inflation and changing consumer preferences. A
positive result strengthens the GBP, a negative result weakens it.

In January, Core CPI (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) grew by +1.6%, in February - by
+1.7%, and in March - by +1.6%. It is likely that the publication of the
indicator will positively affect the pound if its value is higher than
the forecast and the previous value. Forecast for April: +1.4% (in
annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)). An indicator below the forecast and / or previous values
​​can trigger a weakening of the pound.

###  **12:30 CAD Consumer Price Indices in Canada**

The Bank of Canada's Core Consumer Price Index (Core CPI) reflects the
dynamics of retail prices for a basket of goods and services (excluding
fruits, vegetables, gasoline, fuel oil, natural gas, mortgage interest,
long-distance transport, and tobacco products). The target inflation
rate for the Bank of Canada is in the range of 1-3%. The increase in CPI
is a harbinger of a rate increase and a positive factor for the CAD.
Consumer prices in January rose by +0.3% (+2.4% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)), in
February - by +0.4% (+2.2% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)), and in March the index fell
by -0.6%. Core Consumer Price Index rose in March by 0% (+1.6% on an
annualized basis). If the data for April is worse than the previous
values, this will negatively affect the CAD. Data better than expected
and above the previous values ​​will strengthen the Canadian dollar.

Forecast for April: Consumer Price Index will come out with a value of
+1.2% (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)).

###  **18:00 USD Minutes from the last meeting of the Federal Open
Market Committee (FOMC minutes)**

The publication of the minutes is extremely important for determining
the course of the current Fed [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) and the prospects for raising
interest rates in the United States. The volatility of trading in
financial markets during the publication of the minutes usually
increases, since the text often contains either changes or clarifying
details regarding the outcome of the FOMC meeting.

Following two meetings in March, the Fed sharply cut its interest rate
(to 0.25% from 1.75% in February), and also announced the allocation of
US $700 billion for the purchase of US government bonds and mortgage-
backed securities. Subsequently, the Fed has repeatedly announced
additional measures to support the US economy and inject cheap liquidity
into the financial system.

During an online session organized by the Peterson Institute for the
World Economy, the Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said that “in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of
scale and speed, this decline has no precedent in modern [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) and is
much worse than any recession since World War II,” adding that the Fed
has not considered negative interest rates.

The soft tone of the minutes will have a positive effect on stock
indices and negatively on the US dollar. The harsh rhetoric of Fed
leaders regarding monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) prospects will push the dollar towards
further growth.

###  **Thursday, May 21**

Europe celebrates the Catholic Ascension Day. Banks in European
countries will be closed, and therefore trading volumes during the
European session will be low.

###  **02:30 AUD Speech by RBA Head Philip Lowe**

In his speech, Philip Lowe will give an assessment of the current
situation in the Australian economy and point out further plans for the
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the agency. Any signals from him regarding the change
in the plans of the RBA monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) will cause a sharp increase in
volatility in the AUD trading and in the Australian stock market. If he
does not touch on the topic of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), then the reaction of the
market to his speech will be weak.

Market participants would also like to hear Lowe's opinion on the
policies of the central bank in the context of the ongoing pandemic of
the coronavirus and the threat of recession in Australia's economy for
the first in 30 years.

“Substantial uncertainty remains regarding the short-term prospects of
the Australian economy. In April-June, a very strong reduction in GDP is
expected, as well as an increase in unemployment to a multi-year high,”
said Philip Lowe after the central bank kept its current monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
unchanged in early May. The key interest rate of the RBA was kept at a
record low level of 0.25%, and the target level of yield on 3-year
government bonds was also left at 0.25%. The decision to lower the rate
and determine the current target level of government bond yield was made
at an unscheduled meeting of the RBA on March 19 in order to support
Australian business and citizens amid the rapid spread of the
coronavirus pandemic.

###  **07:30 EUR Manufacturing PMI of the German economy according to
Markit Economics (preliminary release). Composite PMI of the German
economy according to Markit Economics (preliminary release)**

PMI business activity index in the manufacturing sector of the German
economy is an important indicator of business conditions and the general
state of the German economy. This sector of the economy forms a
significant part of German GDP. A result above 50 is seen as positive
and strengthens the EUR, below 50 - as negative for the euro. Forecast
for May (preliminary release): 40.0.

Previous values: 34.5 in April, 45.4 in March, 48 in February, 45.3 in
January, which indicates a slowdown in business activity in this sector
of the German economy. The growth of the indicator above the previous
value may support the euro (in the short term), although its value is
still below the value of 50. Data worse than the forecast will have a
negative impact on the euro.

Composite PMI in the German economy is an important indicator of the
business environment and the general state of the German economy. A
result above 50 is seen as positive and strengthens the EUR, below 50 -
as negative for the euro. Forecast for May (preliminary release): 36.0
against 17.4 in April, 35 in March, 50.7 in February, 51.2 in January.
The publication of this indicator with the indicated expected value is
unlikely to support the euro. The data worse than the forecast and below
the value of 50.0, as a rule, have a negative impact on the euro.

###  **08:00 EUR Composite manufacturing PMI of the Eurozone economy
according to Markit Economics (preliminary release)**

Eurozone's PMI is an important indicator of the state of the entire
European economy. A result above 50 is seen as positive and strengthens
the EUR, below 50 - as negative for the euro. Forecast for May
(preliminary release): 24.0 versus 13.6 in April, 29.7 in March, 51.6 in
February, 51.3 in January, which is unlikely to have a positive impact
on the euro, even despite relative growth. If the data turn out to be
worse than the forecast, then the euro may fall sharply in the short
term.

###  **08:00 GBP UK Services PMI by Markit Economics (preliminary
release)**

PMI in the UK services sector is an important indicator of the state of
the British economy, although the services sector does not have such a
strong impact on the country's GDP as PMI in the manufacturing sector.

If the data turn out to be worse than the forecast and the previous
value, then the pound will most likely sharply decrease in the short
term. Data better than forecast and the previous value will have a
positive impact on the pound. At the same time, a result above 50 is
seen as positive and strengthens the GBP, below 50 - as negative for the
GBP.

Previous indicator values: 13.4 in April, 34.5 in March, 53.2 in
February, 53.9 in January. Forecast for May: 22.1.

###  **12:30 USD Initial jobless claims in the US over the past week**

The situation on the country's labor market continues to deteriorate
rapidly. Back in February, the indicator of initial claims for
unemployment benefits was within its average values ​​of 193-252
thousand. However, then the situation began to deteriorate sharply. Over
the week of March 22-28, 6.9 million claims were submitted, then 6.606
million applications, shocking observers and market participants. A
similar indicator published last Thursday (for the week of May 03-08)
came out with a value of 2.981 million claims.

The US Department of Labor data published earlier this month showed an
increase in unemployment in the country in April to 14.7%. Economists
attribute this to the coronavirus, which has damaged the US economy.
Many US companies announced layoffs, and authorities ordered non-vital
companies to close their offices and stores in the wake of the
coronavirus epidemic. Current weekly growth rates of claims far exceed
the previous record level of 695,000, reached in October 1982. Then the
number of initial claims filed in four weeks was 2.7 million.

This indicator (the number of initial claims for unemployment benefits)
reflects the state of the labor market. An increase in value negatively
affects consumption and economic growth. Under normal conditions, a high
result weakens the US dollar, while a low one strengthens it. However,
in the current environment (the coronavirus pandemic and a sharp
economic slowdown), the reaction of market participants to the
publication of this report by the US Department of Labor can be
completely unpredictable.

###  **18:30 USD Speech by the Fed Chairman Jerome Powell**

Powell's comments may affect both short-term and long-term USD trading
if he again touches on the Fed's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). A more hawkish
position regarding the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the Fed is seen as positive
and strengthens the US dollar, while a more cautious position is
assessed as negative for the USD.

If he makes unexpected statements, the volatility in trading in
financial markets may increase. Any hints to the need for an even softer
central bank [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) will cause the dollar to fall and the US stock
markets to rise.

Participants in the financial market will carefully study his speech in
order to catch signals regarding the Fed’s further actions. If he does
not touch upon questions of the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the Fed, the reaction
to his speech will be weak.

###  **22:45 NZD Retail Sales (Q1)**

The retail sales report is published by the New Zealand Bureau of
Statistics. Changes in retail sales are generally considered an
indicator of consumer spending. In general, a high value of the
indicator is a positive factor for the NZD, and a low value is a
negative factor. In the 3rd quarter, retail sales grew by +1.7%, and in
the 4th quarter - by +0.7%. The NZD will strengthen if the data is
better than the previous value. A weak report will negatively impact the
NZD.

###  **23:30 JPY National Consumer Price Index (CPI)**

National Consumer Price Index (CPI) is published by the Japan Bureau of
Statistics and determines the price change of a selected basket of goods
and services for a given period. It is a key indicator for assessing
inflation and changing consumer preferences. A positive result
strengthens the JPY, a negative result weakens it.

In March, National CPI grew (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) by +0.4%. Core National
CPI (ex food and energy) grew by +0.6%. It is likely that the
publication of the indicator will positively affect the yen if its value
is higher than the forecast and the previous value. Forecast for April:
National CPI (excluding food and energy) fell by -0.1% (in annual
[terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)). This value is likely to provoke weakening of the yen.

###  **Friday, May 22**

###  **11:30** **EUR Account of the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) meeting of the ECB**

This document provides an overview of the current [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the ECB with
the planned changes in the financial and monetary spheres. The
publication of this document may cause a surge in volatility in trading
of the euro and the European stock market.

Investors will carefully study the text of the minutes of the recent
meeting of the ECB in order to catch additional signals regarding the QE
program and the prospects for monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). Recently, weak macro data
from the Eurozone have been indicating a slowdown in the European
economy, which, against the backdrop of international trade conflicts
and the coronavirus pandemic, is putting pressure on the ECB towards
further easing of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).

At the meeting on April 30, the ECB refrained from making changes to the
current [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the bank. Nevertheless, the volatility in trading on
the euro could rise sharply if the minutes from the April meeting of the
ECB contain unexpected statements or new information regarding the
prospects of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).

###  **12:30 CAD Retail Sales Index**

Retail Sales Index is published monthly by Statistics Canada and
estimates total retail sales. The index is often considered an indicator
of consumer confidence and reflects the state of the retail sector in
the near future. Index growth is usually a positive factor for the CAD;
a decrease in the indicator will negatively affect the CAD. Previous
index value (for February): 0.3%. If the March data turns out to be
weaker than the forecast (according to the forecast, zero growth in
retail sales is expected), the CAD may drop sharply in the short term.
