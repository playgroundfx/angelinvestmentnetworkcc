Yuan prefers scalpel over sledgehammer. Forecast as of 03.02.2021Dmitri
Demidenko

[USDCNH][1] is stuck in the area of 2.5-year lows and is awaiting a hint
from the US to determine the direction of further movement. Let us
discuss the Forex outlook and make up a trading plan

## Fundamental yuan forecast for six months

Markets are like travelers: they can't move in the same direction for a
long time. They need a break from time to time. Forex is no exception.
After explosive growth in May-January, the yuan entered a state of
consolidation against the US dollar, in which it remains for the fourth
week in a row. Even though the [USDCNH][1] bears have many advantages
that allow them to count on the continuation of the downtrend, the
obstacles created by Washington can foil all their efforts.

Formally, all those drivers that moved the yuan upward in 2020 will
continue to operate in 2021. According to the Congressional Budget
Office's forecasts, the US economy will grow by 3.7% this year, while
the Chinese by 8.2%. If anyone thinks that the outbreaks of COVID-19 in
China will prevent this, I hasten to upset them. Beijing has sufficient
experience in containing the pandemic, and leading indicators from
Bloomberg show that the Chinese economy continued to grow in January.

The People's Bank of China may say that there will be no sharp
turnaround in monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), it still has more room for rate hikes
than the Fed. The PBoC does not risk scaring global financial markets
with its actions. At the same time, the explosive growth of the economy
and worries about bubbles in the asset markets could provoke a hawkish
stance.

Chinese assets still look more attractive than US assets. The
liberalization of the economy and the removal of foreign [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s'
restrictions contribute to the inflow of capital to Asia and the
inclusion of local securities in the global MSCI and FTSE Russell
indices. Over the past year, the Shanghai Composite has risen by 26.4%,
significantly outperforming the [S&P 500][2] (has risen by +16.4%).
China's 10-year bond yield is 3.2%, compared to 1.1% on treasuries.

Add to this the yuan's growing appeal as an asset for central banks'
gold and foreign exchange reserves, and it may seem that the [USDCNH][1]
bulls are doomed. This is not the case. Traders need to get used to the
fact that everything can turn upside down in Forex. The yuan was
actively growing in 2020 because its buyers were betting on Joe Biden's
victory in the US presidential election. The Democratic candidate seemed
to be the best alternative to Donald Trump, who imposed numerous tariffs
on China.

Indeed, the US President's negotiating position seems to be a kind of
surgical intervention compared to the "sledgehammer [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)" used by his
predecessor. At the same time, Biden noted that he did not intend to
cancel tariffs yet, and the Secretary of the Treasury, Janet Yellen,
said some unpleasant things about China.

### [USDCNH][1] trading plan for six months

In my opinion, the stop of an escalation of the conflict between
Washington and Beijing is necessary for the continuation of the
[USDCNH][1] decline in the direction of the [previously indicated][3]
targets of 6.32 and 6.2. The bulls' inability to bring the pair out of
the upper border of the consolidation range of 6.42-6.51 may be a reason
for increasing shorts.
