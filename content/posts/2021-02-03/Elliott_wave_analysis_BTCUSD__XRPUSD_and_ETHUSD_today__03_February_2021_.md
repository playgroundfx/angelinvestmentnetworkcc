Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 03.02.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

Ethereum and Bitcoin have completed forming corrective waves, and the
price should start rising in impulse waves.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

The deep corrective wave 4 seems to have completed in the large upward
impulse. Wave 4 is a bearish triple zigzag [W]-[X]-[Y]-[X]-[Z]. The
final motive wave [Z] is simple zigzag (a)-(b)-(c). There is unfolding
the initial part of the upward impulse wave 5. There have completed the
sub-waves [1]-[2]. Therefore, the BTCUSD price should be rising in wave
[3] to a level above 38670.00.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 36676.00 TP 38670.00

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

The XRPUSD market is forming the upward impulse wave. The first two
legs, sub-waves (1) and (2) have completed. There has started developing
impulse (3). The first impulse wave 1 of wave (3) has finished. There is
now forming the bearish corrective wave 2 as a simple zigzag
[a]-[b]-[c]. Impulse [c] will conclude correction 2 at a level of around
0.300. Next, the market should turn up and start rising.

### Trading plan for **[XRPUSD][2]** today:

Sell 0.379, TP 0.300

## Elliott wave Ethereum analysis

The horizontal corrective wave 4 must have completed as a triangle
composed of five major sub-waves [A]-[B]-[C]-[D]-[E]. Therefore, the
price should be rising in wave 5, which could complete as a simple five-
wave impulse or an ending diagonal. The first target for buy trades is
level 1700.00.

### Trading plan for  **[ETHUSD][3] **today:

Buy 1551.05, TP 1700.00
