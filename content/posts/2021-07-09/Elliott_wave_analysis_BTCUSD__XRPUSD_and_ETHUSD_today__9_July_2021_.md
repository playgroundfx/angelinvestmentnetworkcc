Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 09.07.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

The XRPUSD market must be forming an upward double zigzag, with the
final leg unfolding inside.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

The BTCUSD market completed the down wave [A] as an impulse
(1)-(2)-(3)-(4)-(5). Next, the market started rising. There must be
unfolding the first leg of the bullish zigzag, sub-wave (A) as a leading
diagonal 1-2-3-4-5. The complex corrective wave 4 must have completed as
a double zigzag [W]-[X]-[Y]. There should be developing the final fifth
wave, and the price should reach level 38100.00.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 32688.00, TP 38100.00

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

The XRPUSD market completed the down wave (W), next, the market turned
up and started rising. There must be forming the upward double zigzag
W-X-Y. The first two sub-waves W and X have completed as double zigzags
of a smaller degree. There should be developing the Y wave as a bullish
zigzag [A]-[B]-[C], which could end at a level of 0.812. At this level,
wave Y will be 100% of wave W.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] **** today:

Buy 0.606, TP 0.812

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

The ETHUSD price finished declining in the bearish five-wave impulse A.
Next, the market turned up and started forming a new upwave. There might
be forming the sub-wave [A] of the new simple bullish zigzag
[A]-[B]-[C]. Wave [A] is developing as a leading diagonal
(1)-(2)-(3)-(4)-(5). The price could go down a little in the final leg
of sub-wave (4). Next, the Ethereum price will start rising in the final
sub-wave (5) towards a level of 2555.00.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Buy 2071.61, TP 2555.00
