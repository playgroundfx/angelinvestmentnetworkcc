Euro wants to have fun. Review as of 09.07.2021Dmitri Demidenko

If you can't make heads or tails of what's going on, just get to work

## The audience sometimes gets bored, and the market starts to divert
it.

People believe their fairy tales just until they turn to horror films.
It appears that the [EURUSD][1]'s collapse from May's highs to a 3-month
trough had to persuade bulls to go over to their opponent's side.
However, some traders continue to cling to long positions hoping that
this nightmare will end soon as they believe in the pair's growth to
1.25. Will it?

However influential central banks may be, a monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) alone won't
be enough. It's money that controls markets. If carry traders got
frightened of the Delta variant of COVID-19 and started to dispose of
developing countries’ currencies and turn back to funding currencies,
the Fed and the ECB won't help. The rouble and other emerging market
currencies continued to retreat, while the euro and the Japanese yen
seem to start a new life. The pandemic is here again, the global
economy's prospects are getting worse, and stock indexes with bond
yields are moving to the downside, pulling the dollar with them.

Our life is a short moment between "I want to know as much as possible"
and "I wish I had never known it." I sometimes feel sorry for inter-
market analysis fans or learners. In March, 10-year bond yields and the
US dollar grew; in June, bond rates started to fall, but the dollar
consolidated all the same. The [S&P 500][2] falls, and the USD index
also falls, although it has to be the other way round, in theory. The
greenback is a safe-haven asset, right? So, it has to be highly demanded
amid a poorer global appetite for risk. Thus, we sometimes can't make
heads or tails of what's going on in the Forex market.  ​

But we just need to understand: there's Greed, Fear, and certain trading
ideas that prevail in the market. Some cling to those for a long time,
and some don't. However, none can say for sure that the [EURUSD][1] will
move where it's expected to move. Fast economic growth, inflation boost,
and the Fed's intention to normalize the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) are easily
interpreted signals, but this chain can sometimes fail to function
correctly.

“GDP isn't growing that fast!”

"And what about the Delta variant?"

Doubts provoke fears, traders close short positions, and the EURUSD
rises.

> \- Can you read thoughts?

>

> \- Only my own ones. With a dictionary.

It's hard to read the market's thoughts: it's like a baby that sometimes
gets bored. As a result, divergent monetary policies and economic growth
are no longer considered. The market wants to have fun! What a circus!

Two trained lions are performing in the arena. One lion tells the other:
"The audience seems bored. Let's jump over the barrier and divert it!"

So, if you decided to engage yourself in trading, remember that the
market changes every second. You need to work hard to understand what's
going on here. That's the only way to reach success. If you mewed and
your bowl is still empty, that should mean you aren't a cat. Just get to
work!
