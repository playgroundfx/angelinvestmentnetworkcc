USDCAD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 09.07.21 – 16.07.21Alex
Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider short positions below the level of 1.2880
with a target of 1.2000 – 1.1850 once correction is completed.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
1.2880 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 1.3413 –
1.3722.

 **Analysis:** Daily time frame: wave (С) of 4 of larger degree
continues developing, with the third wave 3 of (C) formed inside.
Presumably, an ascending correction is nearing completion as wave 4 of
(С) on the H4 time frame, with wave c of 4 forming inside. Apparently,
wave (iii) of c is developing on the H1 time frame. If this assumption
is correct, the pair will continue to fall to 1.2000 – 1.1850 once wave
c of 4 is completed. The level of 1.2880 is critical in this scenario,
as a breakout will enable the pair to continue rising to the levels of
1.3413 – 1.3722.
