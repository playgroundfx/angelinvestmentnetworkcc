XAUUSD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 09.07.21 – 16.07.21Alex
Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions from corrections above the
level of 1749.36 with a target of 1958.14 – 2016.10.

 **Alternative scenario:** Breakout and consolidation below the level of
1749.36 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of
1673.40 – 1568.91.

 **Analysis:** an ascending third wave of larger degree (3) formed on
the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame, and a descending correction developed as wave (4),
supposedly. The fifth wave (5) appears to be developing on the H4 time
frame, with the first wave of smaller degree 1 of (5) formed and a
downward correction completed as wave 2 of (5) inside. The third wave 3
of (5) is starting to develop on the H1 time frame, with wave (i) of i
of 3 formed inside. If the presumption is correct, the pair may be
expected to rise to the levels of 1958.14 – 2016.10. The level of
1749.36 is critical in this scenario as a breakout will enable the pair
to continue declining to the levels of 1673.40 – 1568.91.
