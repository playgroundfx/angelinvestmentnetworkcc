Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 09.07.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

The Target Zone 1.1799 - 1.1781 was held by euro buyers, which caused
correction.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

Oil is correcting and approaching the border of the short-term downtrend
73.19. The task of traders who are following the trend is to look for
oil sales in the zone of 73.19 - 72.62 according to the pattern with a
target at yesterday's low.

If the Intermediary Zone is broken out today, the trend will reverse up.
From Monday next week, look for purchases with a target in the upper
Target Zone 76.10 - 75.57.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

Sell according to the pattern in the zone of 73.19 - 72.62. TakeProfit:
70.30. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

After reaching the Gold Zone, major players decided to exit longs, and
speculators took advantage of the situation in order to sell gold down
to the border of the short-term uptrend of 1795 - 1793. As a result, the
trend border was reached, which led to the opening of new purchases by
major players.

Now the gold price is trading above the key support, which prompts
traders to look for purchases according to the pattern with a target at
yesterday's high.

Gold sales are not relevant at the moment. To make them relevant, a
breakout of level 1793 and price consolidation below are required. In
this case, the target will be the lower Target Zone 1773 - 1768.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

Buy according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 1795 - 1793.
TakeProfit: 1818. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

The Target Zone 1.1799 - 1.1781 was held by euro buyers, which made
major players exit sales and open speculative long trades. As a result,
an upward impulse appeared yesterday, within which the euro prices
approached the Intermediary Zone 1.1878 - 1.1869.

The Intermediary Zone together with level 1.1890 forms the trend key
resistance zone. If the price reaches this zone, it will be profitable
to look for new euro sales according to the pattern with the target at
the July 7 low.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

Sell according to the pattern in the zone of 1.1890 - 1.1869.
TakeProfit: 1.1783. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.
