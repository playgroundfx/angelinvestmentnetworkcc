Euro ready to compromise. Forecast as of 09.07.2021Dmitri Demidenko

The European Central Bank does not intend to copy the Fed's strategy,
but the Governing Council’s members are ready for a compromise. However,
the euro-are GDP and inflation a lower than in the USA. How will the
euro perform? Let us discuss the Forex outlook and make up a [EURUSD][1]
trading plan.

## Weekly euro fundamental forecast

I am surprised with the [EURUSD][2] rally up from the three-month lows.
Why are people buying the euro if the euro-area economy is growing
slower than the US, and the ECB intends to maintain monetary stimulus
longer than the Fed? It is especially strange ahead of the European
Central Bank strategy review when the regulator is likely to signal its
willingness to follow the Fed’s [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of average inflation targeting.

Of course, there were reasons for the [EURUSD][2] rally. First, some
people could learn that the ECB will not copy the new Fed strategy,
including stimulating inflation to indicate an average value of 2%.
Second, the lower global risk appetite due to the spread of the COVID-19
delta variant presses down the emerging markets' currencies and makes
carry traders exit risky currencies’ longs and buy funding currencies,
including the yen and the euro.

US stock indexes were falling as [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s were concerned about the
deterioration of the epidemiological situation in the world and the
growing risks of the US GDP downturn due to the increase in unemployment
and supply disruptions. The stock market’s upward correction allowed the
EMs’ currencies to recover a bit and the [EURUSD][2] bears to compensate
for a part of their losses.

According to Christine Lagarde, the ECB doesn’t pursue the average
inflation targeting similar to the Fed. It will allow the CPI to exceed
its 2% target but won’t stimulate consumer prices to reach the average
value.

The ECB position, in this regard, may seem less dovish than that of the
Fed. However, it is rather a compromise between the supporters of
monetary expansion and their opponents within the Governing Council.
Although Capital Economics analysts say the new strategy "would sound
the death-knell for the Bundesbank tradition,” the CPI surpassing the 2%
target is presented as temporary. This is a clear concession to Jens
Weidmann and other ECB hawks, who have repeatedly opposed the use of
emergency measures under normal conditions.

The ECB looks more patient than before, and Christine Lagarde stressed
the difference in the economic expansion and monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the euro
area and US. She says the ECB is not going to end the PEPP, although the
Fed could scale back the QE earlier than expected. The US inflation is
5% up and the GDP is up by 7%, while the euro-area peers grow by less
than 2% and 4.5% respectively. Therefore, the [EURUSD][2] uptrend will
hardly resume.

### Weekly [EURUSD][2] trading plan

Of course, the euro won’t crash dramatically. New coronavirus variants
will bother [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s from time to time, making them worry about
potential economic downturns, I believe humanity will get over the
pandemic. Therefore, it is relevant to sell the [EURUSD][2] on the rise
towards 1.19, 1.193, and 1.1965. The bulls’ inability to consolidate the
price above 1.185 is also a reason to sell.
