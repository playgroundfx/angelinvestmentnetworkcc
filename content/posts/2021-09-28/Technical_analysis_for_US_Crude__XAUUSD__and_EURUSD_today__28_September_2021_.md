Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 28.09.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

The oil year high has been updated.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

The oil price continues to rise within a short-term uptrend. Today the
year high was updated and the Gold Zone 2 75.12 - 74.87 was broken out.
The next growth target is Target Zone 3 77.93 - 77.42.

Look for new gold purchases on correction at strong supports: Additional
Zone 75.22 - 75.10 and Intermediary Zone 73.95 - 73.69. The latter
serves as the trend key support.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

  1. Buy according to the pattern in Additional Zone 75.22 - 75.10. TakeProfit: 76.35. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. Buy according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 73.95 - 73.69. TakeProfit: 76.35. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

The gold short-term downtrend continues. Last week, traders tested the
trend's key resistance Intermediary Zone 1760 - 1758. The zone was held
and the decline continued.

Now sellers are testing the Target Zone 1746 - 1741. If it is broken out
downside, then with a high degree of probability the decline will
continue, and the target will be the Gold Zone 1725 - 1723.

Today it makes sense to set a take profit at current prices and watch
the further development of the situation.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

Watch the market.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

The euro continues to decline against the US dollar like all other major
currencies. The dollar strengthening trend against the background of
hawkish statements by the Fed representatives is obvious. Today Jerome
Powell will give a speech in which he will try to reassure [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s
about the rising inflation and hint at the withdrawal of the bond buying
program.

Meanwhile, the euro is breaking out the support level of 1.1687 and is
heading towards the Gold Zone 1.1645 - 1.1636. It is reasonable to
consider new euro sales on correction at strong resistances: Additional
Zone 1.1722 - 1.1717 and level 1.1749. Level 1.1749 serves as the
trend's key resistance.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

Sell according to the pattern in Additional Zone 1.1722 - 1.1717.
TakeProfit: 1.1676. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.
