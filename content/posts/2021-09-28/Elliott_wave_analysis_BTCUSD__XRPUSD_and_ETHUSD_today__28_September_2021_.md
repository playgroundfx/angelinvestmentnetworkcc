Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 28.09.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

Short corrections seem to have completed for all cryptocurrency pairs
covered in the article. Therefore, the prices should be falling in
impulse waves.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

The BTCUSD continues forming the initial part of the new bearish wave as
an impulse. Sub-waves (1)-(2) look complete. Impulse 1 and correction 2
have finished in the third wave unfolding as an impulse. Correction 2 is
a simple zigzag [A]-[B]-[C]. Impulse 3 must have started. The Bitcoin
price could go down to the previous low of 39500.00.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Sell 42614.00, TP 39500.00

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

The XRPUSD market is going down in the new bearish wave, which should be
unfolding as an impulse. Impulse wave [1], composed of sub-waves
(1)-(2)-(3)-(4)-(5), has recently completed. Next, the market has
started rising in correction [2], which must have finished as a zigzag
(A)-(B)-(C). Next, the market has turned down and continued declining in
the third sub-wave. The Ripple price could go down to a level below
0.805, marked by wave [1].

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] **** today:

Sell 0.934, TP 0.805

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

The ETHUSD market is forming a new bearish trend as an impulse. The most
recent chart section displays the beginning of the third wave, with a
bearish wave [1] and bullish correction [2] completed inside. Correction
[2] is a zigzag (A)-(B)-(C). The market must have started declining in
the third sub-wave to a level of 2643.00, marked by wave [1]. One could
enter sell trades in the current situation.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Sell 2956.93, TP 2643.00
