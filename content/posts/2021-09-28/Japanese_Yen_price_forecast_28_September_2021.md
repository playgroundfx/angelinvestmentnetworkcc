Run, Yen, run. Forecast as of 28.09.2021Dmitri Demidenko

Sooner or later, it had to happen. The profitability of the global debt
market could not remain at a low level indefinitely. Its growth
supported the [USDJPY][1] and [AUDJPY][2] bulls. Let us discuss the
Forex outlook and make up a trading plan.

## Monthly Japanese yen fundamental forecast

The pandemic and the associated recession have forced central banks to
use unconventional methods. However, the return of humanity and the
world economy to normal life implies that monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) will also
become normal. The yen, with its negative rates, control of the yield
curve and a large-scale quantitative and qualitative easing program,
looks like an alien. [USDJPY][1] surged to a 3-month high, surpassing
the 111 mark. It seems that this is just the beginning.

Rising global debt market rates are a sentence for the yen. Japanese
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s, looking at the fixed profitability of the domestic market by
BoJ, are beginning to look for [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) abroad. The flow of capital from
Japan to North America, Europe and even Australia contributes to the
growth of the [USDJPY][1], [EURJPY][3] and [AUDJPY][2] prices. The yen
started the year very badly, as [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s assumed vaccination would
defeat COVID-19, boost economic recovery, and push central banks to
normalize monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). Unfortunately, the optimists had to wait, but
now their patience is paying off handsomely.

Much has been said about the advantages of the greenback, but AUD is
ready to present a pleasant surprise. After months of neglect, the
Australian dollar is beginning to show signs of life. Yes, iron ore is
in a deep recession, but Australia's [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of trade indicate that its
currency is undervalued. Yes, Beijing is struggling with Evergrande, but
the People's Bank has pledged to keep the country's property market out
of turmoil. Yes, in the third quarter the Australian economy is likely
to decline due to lockdowns, but in the fourth quarter it will grow
rapidly.

These factors allow us to count on the Aussie rebound against such
potentially weak and sensitive to the growth of bond yields currencies
like the yen.

The pressure on the [USDJPY][1] and [AUDJPY][2] bears is created by the
Bank of Japan's commitment to ultra-easy monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), as BoJ
officials made it clear during their last meeting, as well as a
political factor. On September 29, the new leader of the Liberal
Democratic Party will be announced, who will most likely become the new
Prime Minister of Japan on October 4. The main contenders are Minister
for Administrative Reform and Regulatory Reform Taro Kono and former
Foreign Minister Fumio Kushida. Uncertainty and rising foreign bond
yields are the best triggers for capital outflows.

### Monthly [USDJPY][1] and [AUDJPY][2] trading plan

The growth in Treasury rates is associated, among other things, with the
expectations of the government shutdown and the US default. If the
latter happens, then urgently exit [AUDJPY][2] longs. In the meantime,
hold and periodically add up on corrections [previously ][5]formed
[USDJPY][1] longs with targets at 111.7 and 113. It is reasonable to use
breakouts of resistances at ¥81.35 and ¥81.9 to buy the Australian
dollar. Use ¥83.6 and ¥86 as targets.
