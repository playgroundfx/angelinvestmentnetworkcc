Dollar: ends justify means. Forecast as of 28.09.2021Dmitri Demidenko

In late winter and early spring, the rise in the Treasury yields
couldn't break the [EURUSD][1] uptrend. However, the trend is down in
autumn; bears control the market. Let us discuss the Forex outlook and
make up a trading plan.

## Monthly US dollar fundamental forecast

What is evidenced by the rally in 10-year Treasury yield above 1.5%? Has
the market believed in the Fed's monetary normalization? Has the US
economy recovered from the pandemic is now back to the norm? However,
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s could be selling off Treasuries amid the expectations of the
default, the first in US [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/). After all, the result is more
important than the reasons. And the result is that the Treasury yield
rally lures [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s to US assets strengthening the US dollar.

The last time a similar rise in Treasury bond yields took place was in
February-March, sending the EURUSD down when most [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s expected the
further rise in the currency pair. At that time, the Fed's passive
attitude and mantra about the temporary nature of the PCE surge pressed
down the bond yields growth. FOMC officials are still unanimously saying
that the PCE surge will not be long-lasting, but at the same time, they
are raising their inflation forecasts. New York Fed President John
Williams argues that the headline highlighting the continued economic
recovery is good, but the subtitle suggests that the central bank needs
to be patient. This time, it is not about the QE tapering, the process
of which should start in November, but about the federal funds rate
hike.

Unlike in the  February-March period, the greenback and sellers of US
Treasury bonds have not only strong US domestic data and fears of
further inflation growth as an advantage. The prospects of default are
increasing, and even the Fed will be unable to help, according to Jerome
Powell. John Williams also notes that the central bank has been unable
to mitigate the Treasury's failure to fulfill its duties. He urges
lawmakers to remain reasonable. But Senate Republicans, on the contrary,
blocked the House-approved bill that would suspend the national debt
limit until December 16, 2022, and temporarily fund the government until
December 3, 2021. It was rejected by 48 votes to 50. 60 votes were
necessary.

The [EURUSD][1] bulls were not encouraged by the [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) that the World
Bank raised its forecast of China's economic growth this year to 8.5%
from 8.1%, citing the successful fight against the pandemic, and the
People's Bank of China promised to ensure a healthy real estate market.
As expected, the victory of the Social Democrats in the German elections
was neutral for the euro. The Germans face weeks of coalition formation,
and uncertainty is not a reason to buy regional currency.

### Monthly [EURUSD][1] trading plan

Thus, expectations of the start of the Fed's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
normalization and the aggravation of the government debt ceiling, which
may ultimately lead to a default, support the [EURUSD][1] bears. If the
price breaks out the support at 1.168, one could add up to the shorts
entered earlier with targets at 1.1615 and 1.1555.
