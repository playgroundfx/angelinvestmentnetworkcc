Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 16.11.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

The short-term gold uptrend continues.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

Yesterday, oil reached the Target Zone 78.48 - 77.97 as part of a short-
term downtrend. This was followed by the closing of large sales and the
price correction. As part of the correction, the price reached the
Additional Zone 79.72 - 79.59. The AZ has been broken out, and now the
price is trying to reach the Intermediary Zone 81.12 - 80.87.

Today it is reasonable to look for short trades in the zone of favorable
prices 81.12 - 79.59, since the short-term trend for sales continues.
The sales target will be yesterday's low.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

Open sell positions according to the pattern in 81.12 - 79.59.
TakeProfit: 78.48. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

The short-term gold uptrend continues. The Additional Zone was tested
yesterday, which led to a buyers' reaction and an update of local highs.
After updating the November 12 high, the price went into correction
again and retested the Additional Zone 1861 - 1860. Today, the uptrend
in the AZ continues. The uptrend's target is to test the Target Zone 3
1875 - 1871.

If the Target Zone is broken out and the price consolidates higher, the
next target for purchases will be Gold Zone 3 1892 - 1890.

If within the correction, the Additional Zone and level 1860 are broken
out, the next target of the correction will be the Intermediary Zone
1851 - 1849. The IZ serves as the border of the short-term uptrend.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

Hold up buy trades entered in Additional Zones. TakeProfit: Target Zone
3 1875 - 1871. StopLoss: at the breakeven.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

Yesterday, the euro price continued to decline. As a result the Gold
Zone 1.1428 - 1.1419 was broken out. The next target for sales is Target
Zone 2 1.1340 - 1.1322. Now the price is correcting and approaching the
Additional Zone 1.1404 - 1.1400.

Today the AZ and the IZ serve as strong resistances. The Intermediary
Zone coincides with the technical border of the trend, and together they
serve as the zone of the most favorable sell prices 1.1460 - 1.1444.

It is profitable to consider short trades in the levels mentioned above.
Yesterday's low will serve as the first sales target.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

  1. Sell according to the pattern in Additional Zone 1.1404 - 1.1400. TakeProfit: 1.1359, Target Zone 2 1.1340 - 1.1322. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  1. Sell according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 1.1453 - 1.1444. TakeProfit: 1.1359, Target Zone 2 1.1340 - 1.1322. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.
