Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 16.11.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

The BTCUSD market may have completed the upward impulse wave, so the
price should start declining in the new bearish trend.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

As the price continued declining lower than expected, the (A) wave must
have completed. The Bitcoin price is going down in the inceptive part of
the new descending impulse of a smaller degree. Two small sub-waves 1
and 2 must have completed. There is unfolding the beginning of the third
wave, where the down wave [1] of a smaller degree is about to end soon;
next, there will be developing correction [2] as outlined in the chart.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 61266.50, TP 64360.55

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

The XRPUSD market continues forming the linking wave (X) as a horizontal
contracting triangle A-B-C-D-E. Wave D is currently unfolding as a
simple zigzag [A]-[B]-[C]. The price should go down to a level of 1.045,
which is the support. Next, the market will be rising in the final wave
E as outlined in the chart. One could enter sell trades in the current
situation.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] **** today:

Sell 1.129, TP 1.045

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

The most recent section of the ETHUSD chart displays corrective wave 4
currently unfolding as a zigzag [A]-[B]-[C]. Impulse wave [A] and
correction [B], composed of sub-waves (A)-(B)-(C), have completed. The
Ethereum price should be declining in the [C] impulse to a level of
4137.34. Next, the market could start rising in the final, fifth, wave
as outlined in the chart. One could enter sell trades in the current
situation.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Sell 4353.01, TP 4137.34
