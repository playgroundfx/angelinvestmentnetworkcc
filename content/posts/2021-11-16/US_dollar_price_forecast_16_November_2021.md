Central banks come out of the shadow. Forecast for USDJPY, USDCHF,
CADJPY, EURUSD, EURCAD, GBPNOK and GBPJPY a...Dmitri Demidenko

Some central banks have been providing monetary incentives for a long
time, and others want to get rid of them as soon as possible. How does
this affect Forex pricing? Let's discuss the Forex outlook and make up a
trading plan for [USDJPY][1], [USDCHF][2], [CADJPY][3], [EURUSD][4],
[EURCAD][5], [GBPNOK][6] and [GBPJPY][7].

## Fundamental G10 currencies forecast for six months

If, in 2018-2020, trade wars and a pandemic distracted attention from
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), then in 2021, central banks will again come to the
fore. Expectations of changes in their rates are popular among
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s, and hedge funds actively take advantage of this. If the
clients are not afraid of instability and want to earn 40% per annum,
they should be ready for difficult situations. Central banks arrange
them from time to time.

Regulators should think twice before tapering the QE. The Fed and other
central banks have actively defended the economy from recession. When
lowering borrowing costs to zero levels was not enough, unconventional
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) was adopted. In other words, the QE. Time has passed and
the economy is returning to its normal state, and the same volumes of
monetary incentives are no longer required. Moreover, they are harmful.
The question of who gets rid of them faster is extremely important for
Forex. It allows identifying trends for key currency pairs.

According to Haruhiko Kuroda, the Bank of Japan will not normalize
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), even if other central banks do. The BoJ continues to
buy assets, as a result of which the balance sheet is actively growing.
It is not surprising in such conditions that the yen is the worst G10
performer. The JPY has weakened by almost 11% against the US dollar
since the beginning of the year.

### Dynamics of central banks' balance sheets and public debt

The situation in the ECB and the Swiss National Bank is not much
different from the BoJ. Christine Lagarde and her colleagues take an
unbiased look at the situation in the eurozone and intend to expand the
traditional APP instead of the ECB's pandemic emergency purchase
programme (PEPP). The ECB's balance will continue to grow for a long
time, creating conditions for the euro to weaken against major world
currencies. As for the SNB, Switzerland's close ties to the eurozone
prevent it from getting rid of stimulus before the ECB does. Such a
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) contributes to the euro's fall against the greenback by 5% and
against the Swiss franc by 7% since the beginning of the year.

The central banks of Norway, Canada and the Fed are in the opposite
camp. Norges Bank has already raised its rate in September and intends
to do so again in 2021 and three times in 2022. The BoC quickly got rid
of the QE and now the derivatives market expects the overnight rate to
rise in at least three BoC meetings next year. Finally, the Fed could
also tighten monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) two or three times in 2022, and before that
it will end its asset purchase program. The result is obvious, the US
dollar, the Loonie and the Norwegian krone are the G10 leaders.

I don't think that anything will change in the next six-nine months. The
Fed, Bank of Canada and Bank of Norway will be the leaders of monetary
normalization, while the ECB, SNB and Bank of Japan will be outsiders.
This allows me to recommend buying [USDJPY][1], [USDCHF][2], [CADJPY][3]
and selling [EURUSD][4], [EURCAD][5]. I also recommend a combined
strategy of entering [GBPNOK][6] shorts and [GBPJPY][7] longs. Use
corrections for these pairs to form the abovementioned positions in the
direction of the prevailing trend.
