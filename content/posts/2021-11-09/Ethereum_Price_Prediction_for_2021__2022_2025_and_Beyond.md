Ethereum Price Predictions: 2021 and BeyondJana Kane

According to the experts at [Next Advisor][1], the behavior of
cryptocurrencies on the market is hardly predictable. ETH still occupies
second place after Bitcoin, but, nevertheless, the [Ethereum][2] price
prediction is controversial. Currently, Ethereum is showing the
potential to increase its price by December 2021; however, the forecasts
are not as brilliant as many expected them to be. Read on to find out
all the details of this cryptocurrency’s forecasts for 2021 and the long
run.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Ethereum in Short

Like Bitcoin, Ethereum is a separate [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) that has its own digital
currency. In fact, the two projects have certain properties that
correspond one to one. For example, both coins are decentralized. No
country or government backs Bitcoin or Ethereum. Furthermore, both
digital currencies are built on [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) technology so that all
transactions are fast, accurate, and transparent.

However, this is where the similarities end. Ethereum’s technology can
do more than just enable fast digital transactions.

For example, Ethereum offers [smart contract](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/smart-contract-on-blockchain/) technology. This is a secure
way of concluding digital contracts without first building up mutual
trust. Ethereum transfers are also faster than Bitcoin's, and its
[blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) technology can handle more transactions than Bitcoin's.

Most people buy Ethereum on a speculative basis. That means that people
invest in the crypto coin to make money from it.

## Importance of the Network Effect

The biggest advantage of Ethereum is the network effect. It is the first
and, therefore, the [most popular][3] [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) for [smart contract](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/smart-contract-on-blockchain/)s.
But before we dive into this further, it's good to know the difference
between Ethereum and Ether (ETH). These [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) are often used
interchangeably.

By Ethereum, we mean the network and the [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/). You can find all
transactions of a cryptocurrency on a [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/). And on Ethereum,
transactions are paid with ETH. That is the cryptocurrency that comes
with Ethereum. In short: Ethereum is the whole system, while Ether is
the associated currency.

## A Little History of Ethereum

Unfortunately, even we don't have a crystal ball. Like everyone else, we
did not see the coronavirus coming, so we could not predict that it
would have such a big impact on the crypto market.

In 2017 and early 2018, the price of ETH grew almost exponentially. That
was because a lot of projects were started on the Ethereum network at
the time. This was done through Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs). These
projects all had their own coin. As an [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/), you could participate
in these projects by sending them your fiat money. In exchange, you
received these new ETH tokens. ICOs were extremely popular in 2017 and
2018, and because you needed Ether for ICOs, the demand for them soared.
Due to that demand, the price rose to unprecedented heights.

The era of ICOs is over. Regulators have taken care of that. Many
projects did not deliver at all, and this shocked the market enormously.
Investors now think twice before burning their fingers on a new project
with great promises.

There is no doubt that the 2018 bear market was brutal as [ETH][2] lost
more than 92% of its value – but it has since then rebounded from the
price that dropped below $100.

The Ethereum [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) remains unquestionably the most robust smart
contract platform out there. Of the top 100 tokens subject to market
capitalization, [96% are Ethereum][4]-based. Of the 1,000 best tokens,
89% consist of Ethereum.

## Two Important Developments in 2021

Two major developments can push the course of Ether to new heights. The
first is the introduction of a new algorithm called proof-of-stake. The
second one is the development of DeFi.

### Ethereum 2.0

With the renewal of Bitcoin's historic high, all attention is riveted on
it: volumes and interest are growing, and new institutional [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s
are coming. However, crypto [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s with a long-term planning horizon
prefer Ethereum 2.0: the project already reached the TOP-30 in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of
capitalization.

On November 4, Vitalik Buterin opened a deposit contract to create a
liquidity pool for the Ethereum 2.0 network. At that moment, crypto
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s had reserved 1.7 million ETH.

 _Image source: etherscan.io_

The ETH 2.0 [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) upgrade is not currently presented on rating
resources since it will take several years before the network is fully
deployed. Validators reserve funds in blocks of 32 ETH to participate in
staking. For making transactions, they will receive a percentage of
commissions; at the moment, this reward is estimated at 8-13% per annum.
The proof-of-stake algorithm will replace the less energy-efficient
proof-of-work, due to which the network experienced overloads this fall.
And [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s will receive new coins in exchange for old Ethereum in a
1:1 ratio. A reverse transition is not possible.

Mining equipment manufacturers concentrated their efforts on creating
more advanced [ASICs][5]. The highest average hash rate was recorded on
Monday, November 8, 2021.

 _Image source: etherscan.io_



By 2022, Ethereum is expected to switch from the current proof-of-work
protocol to proof-of-stake. Miners won’t need energy-intensive mining
anymore. Instead, staked Ether is going to secure the network. Some
experts claim that it will increase its scalability, security, and
sustainability, so they expect the value of Ethereum to rise as well.
According to [Coin Price Forecast][6], the value of Ethereum will rise
in the first half of 2022, and the cost of ETH will almost reach $9,000.
However, in the second half of the year, the price will decrease to
$8,200. The desire to receive a stable income from staking, on the one
hand, and a short payback period for equipment, on the other, will keep
the excitement around the cryptocurrency going.

The average value of the cryptocurrency is predicted to reach $11,850 by
the end of 2023.

### DeFi

A very important development in recent times is the growth of DeFi. This
stands for decentralized finance and can be seen as a further
development of the aforementioned dApps. DeFi companies are service
providers that provide loan services on the Ethereum [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/), for
example, where only a [smart contract](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/smart-contract-on-blockchain/) is required for the export.

Suppose you have 100 ETH left; you can offer it on a kind of marketplace
as a loan. Someone else can agree to this; the conditions are poured
into a [smart contract](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/smart-contract-on-blockchain/), and the borrower offers collateral. Nothing more
is needed.

Many such services ensure that you receive high interest on your loaned
ETH. And by high, we mean interest that our parents talk nostalgically
about.

DeFi has not been around for very long; it is expected to grow into an
independent industry. Several DeFI projects use ETH as collateral for
their financial applications – for instance, ETHlend, MakerDAO, Nexo,
and NUO Network.

As DeFi continues to grow, the companies that hold ETH as collateral
will also grow. So, it’s a great idea to keep an eye on Ethereum
updates!

## The Introduction of Sharding

"Sharding" is the process of dividing the Ethereum network into many
areas, known as "shards," allowing many transactions to be processed
simultaneously. Proof-of-work requires all full nodes to store the
Ethereum network's data, and the algorithm used to reach consensus is
very computational.

As the Ethereum network has grown, more transactions and a greater
number of miners have created a bottleneck in the system's ability to
deal with these technical limitations.

Sharding is one way of addressing this problem by distributing data and
transaction processing [functions](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/basic-functions/) among different nodes within the
network. All nodes no longer need to store all data and process all
transactions. Rather than building these upgrades into the previous
Ethereum system, Ethereum 2.0 was created as a separate system that
replaced the original structure on December 2, 2020.

Suppose the changes implemented by Ethereum 2.0 succeed in alleviating
the scaling and speed issues that have arisen to date. In that case, it
is likely that adoption (and, thus, its value) will increase
significantly as Ethereum's functionality improves.

## Ethereum price forecast for 2021

ETH, like the rest of the market, is at the center of Bitcoin's price
action. So, when Bitcoin starts a bull run, ETH can also hope for it.

With the pandemic outbreak, the world hibernated for a few months, and
it negatively impacted cryptocurrencies, causing Bitcoin to go downhill
as we recorded even 40% [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) losses. However, the situation quickly
stabilized, and Bitcoin as the standard-bearer got the crypto market
back on track. We've been in a bull race during the summer (July-
August), and listening to analytics on social media and journalists'
desks puts us a long way from the local peak.

As long as Bitcoin is in the lead and moves up, ETH will usually do the
same. ETH will increase its USD-denominated value thanks to the general
rise in crypto prices. The ratio between ETH and BTC is likely to
decline. Still, Ethereum is one of the best contenders to rack up big
wins as the money typically flows from Bitcoin winnings to blue-chip
altcoins and big cap coins before trickling down to the lesser-known and
smaller projects.

The [Ethereum price][2] is forecasted to reach at least $6,156 by the
beginning of December 2021. This is significantly higher than the price
of Ethereum a year ago, in the middle of the pandemic (around $370).

## What Experts Predict

As mentioned above, the fate of Ethereum is tied to the fate of Bitcoin.
Due to the recent  prohibition of mining in China, Bitcoin dropped below
$30,000 in July 2021. Ethereum had no choice but to follow right behind
it.

All Ethereum holders would love the positive predictions to be true.
Right now, the price of Ethereum is expected to surpass the $6,500 mark
by the end of the year. But even then, it is not going to be a stable
result. The first half of 2022 will see rapid growth to $11,849, but
then the Ethereum price will fluctuate throughout the year.

Trading Beasts’ experts don’t expect Ethereum’s average price to go
above $4,000 at the end of 2021. The maximum is predicted to be reached
in December - $4,857.065. The minimum price in November is expected to
be $4,292.040. No dramatic falls are predicted, which is good [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/). The
average price will move to $3,885.652 in December.

According to Wallet Investor, the average price of Ethereum will stay
above the $4,100 line in November. The highest price will be on the 31st
of December - $5,015.740, while the average one will reach $4,722.080.
The minimum is $4,139.850 on the 1st of December. The overall trend is
rather optimistic.

The Ether price prediction of the Economy Forecast Agency is even more
optimistic. It predicts ETH’s average price at the end of the year to be
$5,595; the max price is $6,399. The price on the last day of 2021 is
expected to be $5,980.

Forecasts from Coin Price Forecast show a much brighter outlook than the
others. The Ethereum price at the end of 2021 is predicted to be $7,397.

## Ethereum (ETH) Technical Analysis

Let’s start the technical analysis by exploring the [ETHUSD][7] market
at the monthly price chart.

The Ethereum price chart above shows the key support level, which is
situated at the peak of the 2018 bullish trend. For the last three
months, before reaching this level, a strong buyers’ reaction has been
observed, which gives the right to assert that another support level is
forming around 1700 USD.

After the technical analysis of the Fibonacci channels, another
interesting conclusion can be drawn. If to take the price movement at
the bottom of the bullish trend at the end of 2020 as a basis, then the
Fibonacci channel extension levels show limitation of ETH’s bullish
potential, where the [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) high of 4366 USD formed exactly at the
Fibonacci level of 4.236. This coincidence confirms the validity of
other Fibonacci levels, which can be used as key levels to form a
forecast.

Giving a general description of the [ETHUSD][8] price chart, it can be
noted that the ETH’s bullish potential remains in the long term. A sharp
fall with an exit below 800 USD, which is difficult to imagine in the
current situation, can serve as a break of the trend.

### ETH price prediction for next three months

Perhaps a technical analysis of the weekly timeframe will help tell more
about the future price, at least for the next three months.

The [ETHUSD][2] [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) price movement in the chart above indicates
strong support in the zone of 1700 - 1800 USD. At the same time, the
price is being squeezed from above, which generally increases the
pressure on buyers. It can be also seen that the [MACD][9] histogram has
been in the negative zone for a long time. Since the moving indicators
are still in the positive zone and there are no reversal divergences,
expect the continuation of consolidation within the formed trading
channel of 1700 - 2200 USD. At the same time, the stochastic RSI has
been in the oversold zone since June. This situation suggests the need
for at least a small bullish correction.

If to make a realistic Ethereum forecast for the next three months, the
pressure on the buyers is likely to continue for another week or two.
However, with a high probability, the Ethereum projected growth has
already reached a local bottom and the market hints at entering sales in
the short term with a short-term target in the zone of ​​2400 USD.

### Monthly Ethereum price forecast for 2021/2022

Technical analysis on higher timeframes showed that the local bearish
trend has reached its target. Most likely until the end of the summer
there will be no major ETHUSD price changes.

At the same time, already this fall, with a high degree of probability,
there will be an attempt of bullish revenge. The market will need to
make a decision, which will determine whether an attempt to retest a
[historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) high or another stress test for the buyer will occur. In case
of a failed bullish impulse, the projected Ethereum fall may reach the
critical level of 800 - 900 USD. If the bulls succeed, the future price
can rise to 4200 USD or even higher.

Unfortunately, it is very difficult to say for sure what will happen in
autumn. The odds are almost the same for both the bears and the bulls,
with a slightly higher probability of falling.

Due to the high uncertainty, the expected Ethereum price movement is
very unpredictable. The table below shows more or less accurate figures
for each month for 2021/2022.

#### Long-term Ethereum trading plan

Let's make up an [ETHUSD][2] trading plan based on the most likely
scenario.

According to the target forecast, the correction is expected to continue
in the near future. Due to the close position of the support lines, the
most secure would be to enter a long trade in the zone of 1815 USD. At
the same time, the stop should be below 1740 USD. Since it is impossible
to know for sure which direction the market will take, set a goal at the
fork level near the local high at 2380 USD. The estimated target date is
September/October 2021. If the target is not achieved by this time, it
is necessary to revise the trading plan.

## Weekly Elliott wave Ethereum analysis as of 08.11.2021

The ETHUSD market is forming a long-term corrective bullish trend. It is
clear from the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) timeframe that this trend is unfolding as a three-
wave zigzag A-B-C. Impulse A and bearish correction B, a triple zigzag,
have finished. There is unfolding the impulse wave C, which started more
than a year and a half ago. Sub-waves [1]-[2]-[3]-[4] must have finished
in the C wave, and sub-wave [5] is still developing. Let us study its
structure in more detail in the eight-hour timeframe.

It is clear from the eight-hour timeframe that the fourth leg of the
large bullish impulse C, correction [4], finished in late June. The
price has been rising in wave [5], where sub-waves (1)-(2)-(3)-(4) have
finished so far. The final impulse sub-wave (5) is still forming, it is
about to end soon. The price should go down a little in correction 4 of
a smaller degree. Next, the market will resume rising in sub-wave 5
towards a level of 4800.00, where wave [5] will be 76.4% of wave [3].

## Ethereum Price Prediction for 2022 by Crypto Experts

Predictions for 2022 vary from the minimum price of $3,843 to more than
$15,000. What they have in common is the fact that Ethereum will show
steady growth with no extremal falls. The speed of this growth is what
the sources see differently. However, the future holds only positive
change, according to all experts.

Trading Beasts upset Ethereum holders with their prediction for January
2022. According to them, the year will begin with a minimum price of
$3,843.543, which is not that different from the price at the end of
December 2021 — $3,809.860. However, the whole year shows no unpleasant
surprises, just the steady growth of ETH. The maximum price of
$5,266.339 will be reached in December 2022.

Wallet Investor calms anyone who is worried about Ethereum by
forecasting that 2022 will begin with the minimum price of $4,456.890.
The average price will be $6,092.020 in July. December will lighten up
the mood with a maximum price of $7,825.020.

The Economy Forecast Agency’s predictions are the most optimistic. As
you can see below, in December, Ethereum is going to fly above $16,000.
The price will be more than double in 2022. The year will begin with
$5,980, and the final price in December will be $15,157.

Coin Price Forecast predictions are not so optimistic. In the first half
of 2022, the price will climb to $8,779, and a trend of declining will
then be noticed. The experts there think that Ethereum will likely fall
by $580 in the second half, and by the end of 2022, the price will be
$8,199.

## Ethereum Price Prediction for 2023 by Crypto Experts

As Ethereum expert David Cox said, Ethereum, just like any other
cryptocurrency, is sensitive to [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) and regulatory changes. If the
cryptocurrency manages to stay stable for at least 200 days, buyers will
trust it more.therefore the price can go up to $4,106.

January 2023 will begin with a minimum price of $3,604.492. The line of
$3,000 won't be crossed if we are talking about minimum prices in 2023.
The average price throughout the year will be within $4,240.579 -
$4,493.201.

Wallet Investor’s predictions are twice those of Trading Beasts.
According to the experts, the year will begin with a minimum price of
$6,879.410. No harsh downs or quick ups are reserved for Ethereum in
2023. Luckily, the Ethereum price will eventually grow throughout the
year. The average price will go from $7,372.720 on the 1st of January to
$9,988.420 on the 31st of December.

The Long Forecast predicts several ups and downs for Ethereum. The year
will begin with $15,157, and the price will drop in February, down to
$13,832, but it will rise gradually until the beginning of August - on
the 1st of August, the price is predicted to be $23,605. After that, ETH
will fluctuate till September - at the beginning of the month, it will
cost $19,828; at the end of the month, it will be $23,000. The next rise
to $26,680 is expected at the end of October. Then, the price will
decline gradually in November to $22,711. The end of 2023 will bring a
price of $19,077.

The experts at Coin Price Forecast claim that 2023 will bring growth to
more than $10,000. The first six months of the year will show a rise to
$10,044. December 2023 will bring us up to $11,852.

## Ethereum Price Prediction for 2025-2030 by Crypto Experts

“Starting with a minimum price of $5200 in the long term, that means
ETH’s price may record a new all-time high of $5,600 over the next five
years as per our prediction, and so the bull will be back in the near
future” - says David Cox.

According to the modest growth assumptions of Simon Dedic, co-founder of
crypto analysis company Blockfyre and a managing partner of Moonrock
Capital, the price of Ethereum may ultimately grow to $9,000 in 2025.
Many other price predictions fall around the same target.

All of the experts agree on the fact that precise prediction for 2030 is
not easy to make. The further ahead we go in time, the shadier the
picture becomes.

The price of ETH will probably continue to rise to unprecedented heights
in 2030. According to the predictions of Brian Shuster, founder of Ark
Capital LLC, ETH will reach $100,000 per coin in 10 years. This
prediction is backed up by prominent [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s like Dan Morehead, the
CEO of Pantera Capital, who believes ETH will reach six figures by 2030.

Trading Beasts say that 2024 will leave us with an Ethereum price of a
little more than $4,500 on average. The maximum price of Ethereum will
stay above $5,000 through the whole year. The minimum price will not
rise above $4,150. There are no details about what happens afterward.

Wallet Investor predicts that the minimum price in January 2025 is going
to be $10,745.20. Ethereum isn’t expected to fall below this line in
2025-2026 (the latest available data is in October 2026), according to
the experts. The maximum price during these 22 months will be
$20,957.40.

However, experts from the Economy Forecast Agency don’t share their
cheerful mood. Here is their prognosis for 2025.

Predicting prices for new, highly volatile, and risky asset classes is a
thankless task - the best answer is that no one knows. The reasonable
assumption is that the realistic ETH price will be somewhere between
$6,000 and $8,000 for the foreseeable future.

2024 will end with $15,382 for Ethereum. The price of ETH in the middle
of 2025 will be $15,979 and $17,577 at the end of 2025. Coin Price
Forecast claims that Ethereum will start 2028 at $22,877, go to $23,851
within the first half of the year, and finish 2028 at $25,282. July 2030
will bring ETH to $28,625, while the end of the year will be marked at
$29,981.

## ETH Historical Price Changes

We can’t simply make price predictions without looking back. Currently,
ETH is traded at $4 780.77.. Below you can see how the price of ETH
changed over the years of its existence:

Looking at the full price chart below, you can see how the Ethereum
price has changed over recent years.

January 2018 began with a price near $1,300. In April 2018, Ethereum
experienced a price below $400. Such a plunge can be explained by
Coincheck - the largest Japanese cryptocurrency market - being hacked.
The decline was shown until November across all cryptocurrencies. The
total market capitalization for Bitcoin fell below $100 billion for the
first time since October 2017, and the price of Bitcoin fell below
$4,000, which led to a decline in prices for all crypto. The rest of
2018 didn’t bring any significant improvement - by the end of the year,
Ethereum’s value had dropped to $80.

During the first half of 2019, ETH grew to above $300 by June. Ethereum
was joined in its success by its elder sibling, Bitcoin. Ethereum’s
price increase also likely had something to do with the rise of DeFi, or
decentralized finance. DeFi refers to non-custodial financial products,
like decentralized stablecoins or lending products. Most DeFi protocols
are based on Ethereum.

ETH didn’t manage to hold its position. ETH continued to drop in value
throughout August. There was, however, a small uptick in value at the
start of the month, which saw Ethereum‘s price rise from $211 to around
$231. The cryptocurrency fell again by December 2019. In early December,
[US authorities arrested Ethereum developer Virgil Griffith][12] for
consulting with North Korea on [how to](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-trading-how-to/) use cryptocurrency to evade
sanctions. In the middle of December, UK [cryptocurrency exchange](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/best-cryptocurrency-exchange/)
Coinfloor said it would delist Ethereum and Bitcoin Cash.

2020 showed growth up to $290 in January. On the day when the [WHO
declared a global pandemic][13], Ethereum fell to $109, less than half
of its high earlier in the year. At the start of December 2020,[ the
Ethereum 2.0 upgrade got under way][14]. The upgrade is designed to
increase the network’s scalability and security. Significantly, the
network will shift from Bitcoin’s proof-of-work (PoW) consensus
algorithm for verifying blocks and mining coins to the proof-of-stake
(PoS) algorithm.

From January 2021 to April 2021, the price of Ethereum rocketed. It was
only at $1,385.5 in January, but during just five months, the price
reached $4,000. It happened due to the upgrade and shifting to the PoS
protocol. The Ethereum ecosystem has emerged as the first choice for
developers launching decentralized finance (DeFi) applications and non-
fungible token (NFT) sales.

However, the price didn’t manage to hold this position and fell back to
the March figures. The value of ETH in USD has grown from $737.73 on
31th of December 2020 (BinanceUS) to an all-time high of $4,362.35 on
May 12, 2021. Since the 12th of May, a dramatic fall has taken place due
to the overall cryptocurrency downtrend. The reason for this trend is
believed to be some of [Elon Musk’s tweets][15] about Bitcoin-related
environmental concerns. Also, on the 19th of May, the price of Bitcoin
fell by more than 30%, reaching the local minimum of $30,000. As a
result, Ethereum fell to $1,800. The price went down from $4,362.35 on
the 12th of May to $2,099.58 on the 23rd of May.

It was a stepping stone for Ethereum to transition to [a PoS
protocol][16]. Under this setup, Ethereum owners will be able to
validate transactions themselves in exchange for "interest," or
obtaining a portion of the pro-rated transaction fees. Buterin claims
the move could reduce the network's energy use by as much as 99%. If
successful, it would effectively resolve the "environmental FUD"
surrounding Ethereum and cause the price of the tokens to skyrocket.

However, there is a fly in the ointment. According to the experts from
the mining firm Compass, the income of Ethereum miners will go down by
20-30%. The London protocol has burned more than $1 billion of ETH. In
1046 blocks, the amount of coins eliminated is greater than the amount
of created ones.

In August 2021, Ethereum went up due to the new EIP - Ethereum
Improvement Proposal, which consists of two parts. It allows Ethereum
holders to pay fewer transaction fees. Moreover, about 3 mln ETH are to
be removed from the market each year. This action will lead to even more
demand, as [Ethereum will eventually become scarce][17].

A strong uptrend continued until the beginning of September, when
Ethereum reached highs of May 2021 near $3,972. On September 7-8, the
price fell by more than $900. The plunge was caused by the BTC sell-off.
Until September 21, the price of the cryptocurrency was moving down. It
seems ETH/USD has been forming a new downtrend.

However, the next wave of Ethereum’s growth started on September 29;
since then, its price has risen by more than 70%. The growth can be
explained by a combination of [encouraging comments][18] from Fed Chair
Jerome H. Powell, the upcoming [Altair update][19], and the beginning of
October, which has [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/)ly been[ a strong month][20] for
cryptocurrencies. This clear trend upwards was strengthened by the fact
that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has approved
[ProShares’ application][21] to launch the Bitcoin Strategy [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/) on the
15th of October. On November 2, the CME Group announced it would launch
a new Micro Ether futures contract. On November 9, Ethereum rose to a
new all-time high of $4,837.59.

## Is Ethereum (ETH) a Good Investment?

Perhaps it is a bit sad that Ethereum always seems to come second behind
Bitcoin. Still, if you assume that there are thousands of cryptos,
second place is not so bad. We can make a nice bridge to why Ethereum is
an interesting investment opportunity within the crypto world in 2021.

Ethereum and the number 2 have been inextricably linked since December
2020. Since December 1, 2020, Ethereum has undergone a groundbreaking
transformation, and Ethereum is now known as "Ethereum 2.0".

In short, the main upgrade of Ethereum 2.0 over Ethereum 1.0 is in its
scalability. Ethereum 2.0 uses the technique of sharding for this. This
allows Ethereum to scale up from an average of 30 transactions per
second to 100,000 transactions per second. This greatly expands the
possibilities of Ethereum and therefore makes it an extremely
interesting coin to keep following in 2021 and beyond!
