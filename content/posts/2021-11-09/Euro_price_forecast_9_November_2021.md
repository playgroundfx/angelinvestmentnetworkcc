Euro looks back. Forecast as of 09.11.2021Dmitri Demidenko

Although the [EURUSD][1] is up to the bottom of figure 16, the downtrend
will hardly turn up. The approaches of the Fed and the ECB to monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) look too different. How will the divergence affect the euro? Let
us discuss the Forex outlook and make up a trading plan.

## Weekly euro fundamental forecast

The ECB spent much of the past decade struggling to avoid Japan-style
deflation, and its reluctance to raise rates is nothing more than an
echo of the past. Philip Lane, the European Central Bank’s chief
economist, noted that the euro-area consumer prices had averaged 0.9%
from 2014 to 2019. Therefore, based on the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of symmetric
inflation, even at the current level of 4.1%, it does not reach the
European Central Bank’s target of 2 %. Lane believes it is counter-
productive to tighten monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) at the current juncture.

Not so long ago, Christine Lagarde said that the three criteria required
for a rate hike would not be met next year. The dovish tone of the ECB
President, despite the rumors spread by the media about an alleged split
among the ECB members, makes monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) more than transparent. The
Fed’s position is radically different. More flexible labour and housing
markets in the United States compared to the euro area increase the
risks of a self-sustained wage-price spiral forcing the Fed’s officials
to sound hawkish.

According to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, US inflation
expectations for the year ahead increased to a new record high of 5.7%
in October of 2021. Three-year-ahead inflation expectations are up to
4.2%. These are the highest levels since the inception of the survey in
2013.

In such an environment, it is the right thing to suggest monetary
tightening. The Vice Chair of the Federal Reserve, Richard Clarida, has
said the “necessary conditions” for interest rates to rise will be met
by the end of 2022. The unemployment rate will drop to 3.8% from its
current level of 4.6%, as projections suggest, and the inflation rate
will be slightly above the target of 2%. St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank
President James Bullard has said he expects the Fed to raise interest
rates twice in 2022, as job markets are already so tight that it is
adding to inflation through growing wages.

Therefore, the Fed and the ECB stick to completely different views on
interest rates, and the divergence in monetary policies is to support
the [EURUSD][1] bears. The euro-dollar downtrend looks strong, as is
clear from the instruments of bond and derivatives markets. Based on
interest rate swaps, the euro will continue falling.

### Weekly [EURUSD][1] trading plan

Any trend is accompanied by a correction. The [S&P 500][2] has hit its
all-time high for the eighth session in a row, and the real Treasury
yield is down, which encourages the [EURUSD][1] bulls to go ahead in the
short run. Nonetheless, this doesn’t affect the medium- and long-term
prospects of the euro-dollar. It is still relevant to sell the euro
versus the US dollar on the price rise followed by a rebound from the
resistances at $1.161 and $1.1625. A fundamental reason to enter
[EURUSD][1] shorts will be strong US inflation data for October.
