Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 09.11.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

The BTCUSD seems to continue forming the large impulse wave. So, the
Bitcoin price should be further rising.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

The previous BTCUSD trading scenario has been slightly corrected, as the
market continues rising higher than expected. The impulse upwave (A),
composed of sub-waves 1-2-3-4-5, must be further developing. Let us
explore the concluding part of the final wave 5. The Bitcoin price had
been following corrective wave 4 unfolding as a double three [W]-[X]-[Y]
over the previous two weeks. Next, the market started rising in the
final bullish impulse wave 5 composed of sub-waves [1]-[2]-[3]-[4]-[5].
The prices could be growing to a level of 73100.00, where sub-wave 5
will be 50% of sub-wave 3.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 68257.00, TP 73100.00

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

 ****

The hourly XRPUSD price chart displays the structure of the large
linking wave (X), with the final sub-wave unfolding inside as a double
zigzag (W)-(X)-(Y). The motive wave (W) and the linking wave (X) have
completed, so the Ripple price should be rising in the bullish zigzag-
shaped wave to a level above 1.380, as outlined in the chart. One could
enter purchases in the current situation.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] **** today:

Buy 1.263, TP 1.380

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

The ETHUSD hourly timeframe displays the structure of the upward
impulse, with the bullish impulse wave 3 unfolding inside. The first
four sub-waves [1]-[2]-[3]-[4] have finished within wave 3. The Ethereum
price should continue rising in wave 3, which should end at a level of
4930.00. Next, the market will be corrected down in wave 4, as outlined
in the chart.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Buy 4799.46, TP 4930.00
