Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 09.11.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

Today at the Asian session, the euro has reached the Intermediary Zone
1.1610 - 1.1601.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

Yesterday, oil tested a strong support Additional Zone 80.47 - 80.35.
This led to a buyers' reaction. The price increased slightly, but the
local high hasn't been updated.

Today oil continues to trade in a short-term uptrend with the target at
level 81.95. I recommend looking for purchases in the zone of 80.47 -
78.94.

The breakout of the Intermediary Zone and price consolidation below is
required for oil sales. In this case, the trend will reverse down, so
consider short trades with the target in the lower Target Zone 76.65 -
76.14.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

Buy in the zone of 80.47 - 78.94. TakeProfit: 81.95. StopLoss: 78.53.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

The gold price is rising in a short-term uptrend. Yesterday, the Gold
Zone 1816 - 1815 was broken out. The price consolidated above the level
of 1821. The next growth target is Target Zone 2 1837 - 1833.

I recommend considering new gold purchases on correction at strong
levels such as Additional Zone 1817 - 1816 and Intermediary Zone 1808 -
1806. The latter serves as the trend border. After it is broken out, the
trend will reverse down, and it will be profitable to consider gold
sales.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

  1. Buy according to the pattern in Additional Zone 1817 - 1816. TakeProfit: Target Zone 2 1837 - 1833. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. Buy according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 1808 - 1806. TakeProfit: Target Zone 2 1837 - 1833. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

Today at the Asian session, the euro has reached the Intermediary Zone
1.1610 - 1.1601, which serves as the border of the short-term downtrend.
Today, I suggest looking for sales in the zone according to the pattern
with the target at level 1.1514. There is no sell pattern at the moment.

If the Intermediary Zone is broken out upside and the price closes
higher at the US trading session, then the short-term trend will reverse
up. In this case, look for euro purchases with the target in the upper
Target Zone 1.1707 - 1.1689.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

Sell according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 1.1610 - 1.1601.
TakeProfit: 1.1514. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.
