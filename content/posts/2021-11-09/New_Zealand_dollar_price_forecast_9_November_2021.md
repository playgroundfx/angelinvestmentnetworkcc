Kiwi goes ahead. Forecast as of 09.11.2021Dmitri Demidenko

During the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) normalization, there are always leaders and
laggards. Among the first is the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, which
raised rates in early October and intends to do so in November. How does
this affect the [NZDUSD][1], [NZDJPY][2] and [EURNZD][3]? Let us discuss
the Forex outlook and make up a trading plan.

## Monthly New Zealand dollar fundamental forecast

There are always heroes among central banks, as well as among people.
While the majority are in the trenches, individuals rush into the
attack. In Forex, such a fearless warrior is the Reserve Bank of New
Zealand. In early October, it was the first among the G10 to raise the
basic interest rate from 0.25% to 0.5%, allowing Kiwi to become the best
performer of the month. At the same time, the targets for the
[NZDJPY][2] longs and [EURNZD][3] shorts [mentioned in the previous
article][4] were fulfilled, and a long [NZDUSD][1] trade was
successfully opened.

According to Nomura research, due to COVID-19, the growth rate of the
global economy in the next decade will slow down to 2.5%, compared to
2.8% before the financial crisis and 3.4% before 2008. Such global GDP
dynamics make it possible to predict a lower cost of borrowing. In
particular, the company expects the federal funds rate is unlikely to
rise above the 2.5% recorded in 2018 and the 5.25% recorded in 2006. If
the Fed does not act aggressively, why would other central banks do it?

Fortunately, many of them work according to the classical principle: the
higher inflation climbs and the faster the labor market recovers, the
more arguments in favor of tightening monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). In this respect,
RBNZ's actions seem logical. In the second quarter, the unemployment
rate in New Zealand fell from 4% to 3.4%, while Bloomberg experts
forecast 3.9%. This is the lowest mark since 2007 and the lowest in the
[history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) of record-keeping. It looks like the outbreak of COVID-19 and
the Oakland lockdown has had little impact on the workforce, which will
strengthen the central bank's desire to continue monetary restrictions.

Moreover, the situation with consumer prices in New Zealand is also
good. After accelerating to 4.9% in the third quarter, Bloomberg experts
expect further acceleration to 6% in the coming months. RBNZ clearly
does not intend to tolerate this. Interest rate swap markets are 100%
confident that the cash rate will increase at the November 24 meeting
and expect it to continue to rise in February. Moreover, in recent days,
there have been rumors in Forex that Adrian Orr and his colleagues at
the next RBNZ meeting will increase the key interest rate by 50 bps, not
25 bps! This circumstance contributes to the growth of the kiwi price
against the major world currencies.

The [NZDUSD][1] bulls are supported by the Fed's slowness and the
growing global risk appetite, confirmed by a number of new [S&P 500][5]
highs. In my opinion, traders should focus on divergences in monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) and buy [NZDJPY][2] and/or sell [EURNZD][3]. In the first case,
the correction of the yen creates a favorable opportunity for buying the
pair in the direction of 84 and 86. The targets for short EURNZD trades
are the levels of 1.6 and 1.585.
