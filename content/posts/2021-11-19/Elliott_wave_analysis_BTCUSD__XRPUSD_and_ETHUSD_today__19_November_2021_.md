Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 19.11.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

The BTCUSD market could be declining for some time, but the bearish
impulse should soon finish, and the price will start rising in a
correction.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

The BTCUSD market has finished the upward wave (A) as a five-wave
impulse. There is unfolding the beginning of the bearish wave. There
could be unfolding an impulse sub-wave, with the first two sub-waves 1
and 2 completed inside. The bearish sub-wave [1] is currently developing
as an impulse (1)-(2)-(3)-(4)-(5), which should complete at a level of
53550.00. Next, the price could start rising in correction [2] as
outlined in the chart.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Sell 56177.50, TP 53550.00

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

The XRPUSD market continues forming the large linking wave (X) as a
triangle, with sub-waves A-B-C-D completed inside. The final leg of the
D wave, sub-wave [C], has completed as an impulse (1)-(2)-(3)-(4)-(5).
The Ripple price should be rising in the final sub-wave E, which could
finish as a simple zigzag at a level of 1.325. One could enter purchases
in the current situation.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] **** today:

Buy 1.035, TP 1.325

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

The ETHUSD market is forming the global impulse, with corrective wave 4
completed inside as a simple zigzag [A]-[B]-[C]. The most recent chart
section displays the price rising in the fifth sub-wave unfolding as
either an impulse or an ending diagonal. The Ethereum price should be
rising in sub-wave 5 to a level above 4340.00. One could enter purchases
in the current situation.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Buy 4031.78, TP 4340.00
