XAUUSD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 19.11.2021 –
26.11.2021Alex Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions from corrections above the
level of 1758.95 with a target of 1960.00 – 2075.27.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
1758.95 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of
1720.60 – 1673.63.

 **Analysis:** [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) chart: an ascending third wave of larger degree (3)
is formed, a descending correction developed as the fourth wave (4), and
the fifth wave (5) appears to be unfolding, with the first wave of
smaller degree 1of (5) formed inside. H4 chart: apparently, a corrective
wave 2 of (5) is completed, and wave 3 of (5) has started unfolding.
Wave i of 3 is formed and a correction is completed in the form of wave
ii of 3 as parts of wave 3 of (5). The third wave iii of 3 is developing
on the H1 chart, with wave (iii) of iii completed and a local correction
unfolding as wave (iv) of iii inside. If the presumption is correct, the
pair will continue to rise to the levels of 1960.00 – 2075.27 once the
correction is over. The level of 1758.95 is critical in this scenario as
its breakout will enable the pair to continue declining to the levels of
1720.60 – 1673.63.
