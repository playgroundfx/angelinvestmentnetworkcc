EURUSD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 19.11.2021 –
26.11.2021Alex Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 1.1528 with a target of 1.1153 – 1.0988.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
1.1528 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 1.1690 –
1.1910.

 **Analysis:** [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) chart: the first wave of larger degree 1 of (3) is
formed, and a downside correction continues forming as wave 2 of (3),
with wave c of 2 unfolding as part of it. Apparently, the third wave of
smaller degree (iii) of c continues forming on the H4 chart, with wave
iii of (iii) completed inside. A local correction is forming as wave iv
of (iii) on the H1 chart. If this assumption is correct, the pair will
continue to fall to the levels of 1.1153 – 1.0988 once the correction’s
over. The level of 1.1528 is critical in this scenario. Its breakout
will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 1.1690 – 1.1910.
