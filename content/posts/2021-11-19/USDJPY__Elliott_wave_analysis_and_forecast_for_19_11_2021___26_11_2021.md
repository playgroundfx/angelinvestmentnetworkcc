USDJPY: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 19.11.2021 –
26.11.2021Alex Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions from corrections above the
level of 112.75 with a target of 116.00 – 118.00.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
112.75 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of 110.83
– 109.12.

 **Analysis:** [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) chart: there's an ascending wave of larger degree C
that presumably has started forming. The third wave 3 of (1) of С is
unfolding as part of the wave C. H4 chart: a correction is completed as
wave ii of 3, and wave iii of 3 is forming. Apparently, the fifth wave
of smaller degree (v) of iii started forming on the H1 chart, with wave
i of (v) formed and a corrective wave ii of (v) developing inside. If
the presumption is correct, the pair will continue to rise to the levels
of 116.00 – 118.00 after the correction is completed. The level of
112.75 is critical in this scenario as its breakout will enable the pair
to continue declining to the levels of 110.83 – 109.12.
