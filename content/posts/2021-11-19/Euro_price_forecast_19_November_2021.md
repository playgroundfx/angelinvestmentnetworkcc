Euro’s facile victory. Forecast as of 19.11.2021Dmitri Demidenko

No matter how strong the trend is, a correction is inevitable. Whether
it will start for [EURUSD][1] now or a little later is of no fundamental
importance. Divergences in monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) and economic growth will be
pressing the pair down. Let us discuss the Forex outlook and make up a
trading plan.

## Weekly euro fundamental forecast

The 66th record high of the S&P 500 in 2021 discouraged the EURUSD bears
just as well as the rumors about the Bank of England's rate hike after
the release of the UK inflation data. However, taking profit is nothing
more than getting rid of ballast. Most traders will hold down their
shorts while the cowardly ones, as usual, will make far less of the
profit. For a deep correction upward, there should be more significant
factors, which have been missing so far.

Investors have at last understood Christine Lagarde's words that bets on
the ECB rate hike in 2022 do not correspond to the regulator's plans. In
her speech to the European Parliament, the ECB president stressed that
tightening monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) will do more harm than good, and the
conditions for the rate hike will not be met next year. As a result,
money markets shifted expectations for the rate hike to 2023, and the
euro has weakened against the US dollar and other world currencies.

It should be noted that when [EURUSD][1] was trading near 1.1 at the end
of 2019, the euro net speculative shorts were significantly higher than
at present. The downtrend is far from being exhausted, and most
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s understand this.

### Dynamics of speculative positions on major currencies

The [EURUSD][1] downtrend is based on divergence in monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).
While the ECB does not think about raising rates, the Fed is willing to
tighten monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). Even one of the most strong FOMC doves, the
President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, Charles Evans, says
that a rate hike in 2022 may be appropriate. Atlanta Federal Reserve
President Raphael Bostic said he sees an interest rate hike coming in
mid-2022.

Reuters experts are more conservative. According to their consensus
forecast, the federal funds rate will rise for the first time in the
fourth quarter of 2022, followed by two more hikes in the first and
second quarters of 2023. The rate is expected to reach 1.25% - 1.5% by
the end of 2023. At the same time, 27 out of 42 analysts believe that it
is necessary to start tightening monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) earlier, in September.
According to Bank of America, the double pressure of rising prices and
wages will make the central bank raise the rates in the summer, if not
sooner.

Reuters experts expect that the US GDP will accelerate from 2% to 4.8%
in the fourth quarter, and by the end of 2022, the economy will expand
by 3.9%. New York Fed President John Williams believes that the recovery
is progressing steadily, the United States has a huge increase in
employment, and unemployment is falling very quickly. However, things
are different in the euro area with its energy crisis and the threat of
an EU-UK trade war.

### Weekly [EURUSD][1] trading plan

The divergence in monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) and economic growth will encourage the
[EURUSD][1] bears for quite some time. Therefore, it is relevant to sell
the pair on the rebound from resistances 1.143, 1.1455, and 1.1495 or if
the pair goes down below the support at 1.133.
