GBPUSD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 19.11.2021 –
26.11.2021Alex Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 1.3610 with a target of 1.3157 – 1.2831.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
1.3610 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 1.3832 –
1.4050.

 **Analysis:** [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) chart: the first wave of larger degree (1) has
formed and a downside correction continues forming as wave (2). H4
chart: waves A of (2) and B of (2) are formed, and wave C of (2) is
developing. Apparently, the third wave of smaller degree iii of C is
developing on the H1 chart, with a local correction presumably nearing
completion inside as wave (iv) of iii. If the presumption is correct,
the pair will continue to drop to the levels of 1.3157 – 1.2831. The
level of 1.3610 is critical in this scenario as a breakout will enable
the pair to continue rising to the levels of 1.3832 – 1.4050.
