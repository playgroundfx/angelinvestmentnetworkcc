USDCHF: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 19.11.2021 –
26.11.2021Alex Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions from corrections above the
level of 0.9098 with a target of 0.9432 – 0.9506.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
0.9098 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of 0.9016
– 0.8924.

 **Analysis:** a descending first wave of larger degree (1) of 5 is
presumably formed on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) chart. A correction continues developing
as the second wave (2) of 5, with waves A of (2) and В of (2) formed and
wave С of (2) forming inside. The third wave of smaller degree iii of C
is formed, and a local correction has finished developing as the fourth
wave iv of C on the H4 chart. The fifth wave v of C has presumably
started forming on the H1 chart, with wave (i) of v completed as part of
it. If the presumption is correct, the pair will continue to rise to the
levels of 0.9432 – 0.9506 once correction (ii) of v is completed. The
level of 0.9098 is critical in this scenario. Its breakout will allow
the pair to continue falling to the levels of 0.9016 – 0.8924.
