Nothing excites markets as much as a president who tells a central bank
what to do

## Foreign-exchange crisis flares up in Turkey

> \- Doctor, your medicine helped me so much!

Turkish president Recep Erdoğan came up with a new cure for high
inflation – an interest rate cut. He says a softer monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) will
reduce usury and make prices fall. It doesn't matter that the rest of
the world thinks the opposite: he is the head of government and can
invent laws and dismiss personae non-gratae. And that person has been
president for more than twenty years!

> \- Are you sure you want to divorce? You've lived 20 years together!

> \- Do you mean I haven't suffered enough?

Every nation has a president it deserves. So, the Turks have to put up
with the fact the lira has lost over 48% against the US dollar since the
beginning of the year. How could it be otherwise when the central bank
dropped the rate by 400 base points to 15% in September? At the same
time, inflation soared to almost 20%, making real bond yields negative
and resulting in a flight of capital from Turkey. The government and
corporations have to repay $13 billion before the end of the year. That
wouldn't be easy with the current [USDTRY][1] quotes.

> \- Is that true?

>

> \- It's worse. It's what the boss thinks.

When other central banks increase or plan to increase rates to handle
soaring inflation, one Turkish man turns everything upside down. Recep
Erdoğan is sorry for his international friends that defend high
borrowing costs, but he can't go the same way. He's promising to free
his country from high interest rates, and his crazy actions continue
disturbing the world. It reminds me of Camus's novel "Caligula," where
the emperor decided Death and not Life was the most precious gift. He
executed his friends and forgave his enemies. He thanked his executioner
during his murder.

Is there nobody who would explain to Erdoğan he's leading Turkey to
chaos? Those who tried lost their chairs, though. Since 2019, three
presidents of the central bank and all those officials who voted to
raise rates have been discharged from office.

The president's interference with monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) has led to a severe
monetary crisis. Not only has the lira fallen for nine consecutive
years, but also it has lost 50% in value this year. Before September,
they said the period of the lira's weakness was over. The period of
humiliation begins. Recep Erdoğan might have meant well, but it turned
out as always. I hope this man will come to reason one day, although his
current [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) will cost much to his country. It's another proof of the
evil that a president's interference with a central bank's [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) does.
