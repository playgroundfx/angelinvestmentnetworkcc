Williams [Alligator Indicator](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/alligator.html)Alex Rodionov

Bill Williams’s inventions have made an outstanding contribution to
modern trading. Williams is the creator of famous indicators, such as
Alligator, [Fractals](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/fractals.html), and [Awesome Oscillator](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/awesome-oscillator.html), which he introduced in his
book ‘Trading Chaos.’ Many traders nowadays use Williams’s inventions
and trading systems to trade in financial markets.

The article covers the following subjects:

This article deals with a popular Alligator indicator. It will help you
analyze any market, identify the trend, and spot the entry points at the
beginning of the trending market, giving an advantage over most traders.

## What Is the Williams [Alligator Indicator](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/alligator.html), Definition & History

The Forex Alligator or the Williams Alligator is a technical trend
indicator that defines the market state and generates entry points at
the beginning of the price momentum.

As you know, the market can be either trading or consolidating. The
price moved in momentum for about 30% of the entire time; it trades in
correction or accumulation for 70% of the time. The Alligator can
accurately identify the market situation.

Another benefit of the Williams indicator is that it generates the entry
points when the momentum is just emerging. Every trader wants to enter a
trade at good prices and exit at the peak of a trending price movement.
Using the Alligator, you will be able to pick up strong market moves and
take profits at the end of the trend.

However, the Alligator alone is not enough to find out good entry
points. Bill Williams himself applied Alligator together with other
technical indicators he developed. He developed the Profitunity trading
system based on the combination of the technical indicators created by
Williams. The trading system applies [Fractals](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/fractals.html) and [Awesome Oscillator](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/awesome-oscillator.html)
oscillators as additional filters to define entry points.

As for other indicators, not included in the Profitunity system, trades
use standard oscillators, RSI and Stochastic, as signal filters.

### What is the Alligator?

The Williams Alligator analyzes stock indexes, equities, commodity and
precious metal markets, Forex, and cryptocurrency markets. It is a
technical indicator based on the moving averages with different periods.

Moving averages are the price derivatives, so if there is a price chart,
and you can attach moving averages to the chart, such a market can be
analyzed using the Alligator.

The [best time](https://www.fixpro.org/post/forex-best-time-to-trade/)frames to trade with the Alligator are the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/), four-
hour, and one-hour timeframes. It makes no sense to use the Alligator in
shorter timeframes, as there will be many false signals due to the price
noise. For day trading. The H1 will be quite suitable.

Traders employ the Williams Alligator to open both medium-term and long-
term positions in the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) or weekly timeframes and the positions
during the day or week in the shorter timeframes.

### How does the Alligator look in the chart?

The Williams Alligator is a standard technical tool that comes with most
trading platforms by default. You can find the Alligator in the list of
classic trend indicators of the MetaTrader terminal, as well as in the[
personal profile][1] of the LiteForex brokerage company.

That is how the indicator looks on the price chart in the LiteForex
personal profile.

To see the indicator in the chart, you need to activate it. Click on the
Indicator button and select the Alligator in the list:

### What is Forex Alligator? Key takeaways:

  * Bill Williams Alligator is a trend indicator included in most trading platforms by default.

  * It identifies trends.

  * It generates entry points at the very beginning of the price trending movement.

  * It indicates the end of the trend.

  * It works for any asset in any market.

  * The [best time](https://www.fixpro.org/post/forex-best-time-to-trade/)frames to trade the Alligator are D1, H4, H1.

  * It is composed of three smoothed moving averages with different periods. The MAs make up the Alligator mouth; they are the lips, teeth, and jaw.

  * It looks like a hunting Alligator – sleeps, eats, and rests. 

### A bit of [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/)

The Alligator indicator was created by Bill Williams, an American
trader, and psychologist. Williams described the Alligator indicator in
his book ‘Trading Chaos’ in 1995. The Alligator is an element of the
Profitunity trading system, which also includes the Accelerator
Oscillator, [Awesome Oscillator](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/awesome-oscillator.html), [Fractals](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/fractals.html), Gator Oscillator, Market
Facilitation Index, and so on.

Over many years, Bill Williams studied the US stock market and watched
for regularities. As a result, he came to a conclusion that classical
analysis, the support and resistance levels, trend lines, candlestick
reversal, and continuation patterns do not work to predict the future
performance of the market. Moreover, he believed that fundamental
analysis is something like crystal-ball gazing.

Research led the trader to the conclusion that the market is chaos and
trading is a psychological game. Knowing the psychology and
understanding the principles of behavior of market participants, the
zones of accumulation and the moments of price exit from these zones are
determined.

If you enter a trade before the price momentum starts and exit at the
moments when the trend is being exhausted, big money is made easily and
steadily, regardless of single losses.

The Alligator indicator was invented to determine the state of the
market. By observing the market and accumulating knowledge about it,
Williams came to the conclusion that the market's actions are very
similar to the behavior of an alligator during the hunt.

The alligator tracks its prey for a long time, observes, plans an
attack. Then it makes a sharp dash, grabs the victim, and begins eating.
When it is full, it hides and calms down, watching the new victim from
the side.

Likewise, the market operates. The majority of trades see the trend
exhaustion, the accumulation zone forms, there arises uncertainty. Next,
as if out of nowhere, there appears a sharp price momentum, which
triggers the stops of the traders who have been holding trades in the
opposite direction, trying to trade in the correction.

The [individual trader](https://www.fintechee.com/services/individual-trader/)s betting against the big traders become prey, lose
money, and leave the market. When the market “saturates,” it calms down,
and then the same begins, and so on in a circle.

Other indicators, included in the Profitunity system serve to filter
signals and to detail the entry and exit points in the overbought and
oversold markets. Thus, Bill Williams developed an independent trading
system and started to teach traders to use it. The “Trading Chaos” is
still popular and has many followers, and the Williams indicators are
still popular

## How to read the indicator?

Alligator is composed of three smoothed lines, which Williams called
lips, teeth, and jaws. These lines imitate the process of an alligator’s
hunting. The lines are moving averages with different periods and shift
to the future.

Let me explain [how to](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-trading-how-to/) trade with Bill Williams’ Alligator indicator.
Imagine how an alligator hunts.

There are two stages of an alligator’s behavior. In the first stage, the
predator watches the prey as if it is sleeping. In the second stage, the
alligator opens its mouth and grabs the victim, eats food.

The market [functions](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/basic-functions/) in a similar way: 70% of the time, it is trading
flat or in the accumulation zone, and 30% of the time, it is trending.

First, you should define the market stage, whether it is sleeping or
trending.

You enter new trades just before the Alligator starts hunting and exit
all trades before the market calms down.

The hunt begins from the moment when the Alligator opens lips, the
market starts to wake up. The green line begins to construct up or down.
Then the predator brings its teeth closer to the prey - the red line
becomes active and begins to acquire a direction.

Then the terrible jaws open up - the blue line is lined up in the same
direction with the rest. The alligator is ready to eat its prey.

Now you need to spot a moment for the price to start to trade above or
below all three lines of the indicator. In this case, you open buy or
sell positions.

The exit signal appears when all three lines meet at one point, the
trend direction is not clear, or when the lip line crosses the jaw line.
This means that the market is full and will now “sleep” in anticipation
of new prey (momentum).

## Bill Williams: 3 lines of the [Alligator Indicator](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/alligator.html)

The Alligator Forex indicator is composed of three moving averages,
which are called jaws, teeth, and lips. Each of them has a different
color and is responsible for a particular stage of the market
development. Each has its weight, strength.

  * Green line indicates Lips; it is the weakest level. However, it has the fastest reaction to the price changes. This moving average is the first to react to changes in the balance of power of buyers and sellers in the market. This line is used to add up to the opened positions in the trend if there is strong momentum in the chart. 

The lips line is the smoothed moving average (SMA) with the default
period of 5, moved by 4 bars into the future.

  * Red line is the teeth. The line is the average strength support/resistance level. It serves to enter trades when the trend is not that strong. If the instrument is within the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) ATR (average price movement), the Teeth line can be an excellent marker for entering trades in the trend.

The teeth line is the 8-period smoothed moving average that is moved
five days into the future.

  * Blue line – the Jaw is the strongest line. The Jaws line displays the border of the medium-term trend. If the price breaks this line, it usually means that the trend is turning in the opposite direction. It is used to spot the entry points in slow trends or in conservative [trading strategies](https://www.fintechee.com/forex-trading-strategies/) when traders prefer to trade only in the strongest levels/zones.

The jaw is the 13-period smoothed moving average that is shifted into
the future by 8 bars.

I should note that the moving averages are applied to the median price
((high+low)/2), not to the bars’ opening or closing prices.

To adapt the indicator to different timeframes and markets, you should
adjust the parameters (periods and shifts) of the moving averages. You
can also trade with the default parameters, but, in this case, you
should trade in longer timeframes from H4 to D1.

Taken together, the lines form the "mouth" of a hungry alligator, ready
to hunt for inexperienced traders and other market participants who
trade against major players. Note that at the first stage, Alligator
sleeps, and the three smoothed moving averages are at the same point.

Next, the lip line is the first to react, as it is the fastest. Next,
the teeth line reacts, and the jaw line is the last to react. It works
in a similar way as an Alligator opens the mouth to capture the prey.
When the mouth opens, it signals that you should enter a trade.

## How the Williams [Alligator Indicator](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/alligator.html) Works

Market conditions are constantly moving from trend to consolidation and
vice versa. This is the law of market movements. These states resemble
the behavior of an alligator:

When you trade with the Alligator, you should constantly watch the
behavior of the three lines. The location of the lines indicates the
market state.

### The market is not trending

Alligator consists of moving averages. Moving averages, as the name
implies, show the average price values over a certain period. Therefore,
if MAs are in the same place on the chart and do not show any direction
with their slope, then the market is not trending. Differently put, the
market is trading flat.

### The trend may start

The lip line (green) is the fastest moving average. It is the first to
react to the changes in the balance of buyers and sellers in the price
chart. When the lip line crosses slower MAs, we could assume that the
trend is about to start. The Alligator is waking up.

 Following the green line, the lines of the teeth and jaws, the red and
blue ones, begin to acquire directions. When three MAs line up in the
same direction, the trader decides whether to enter the market or not.
When the next candlestick closes above or below all moving averages, it
is a signal to enter a buy or sell trade.

I should note that some traders use additional filters to supplement the
Alligator, as it sends quite a lot of false signals in the sideways
trend before the market determines the direction.

As additional filters, you could employ other indicators developed by
Bill Williams: [Awesome Oscillator](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/awesome-oscillator.html) or [Fractals](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/fractals.html). I will cover [how to](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-trading-how-to/) use
them in detail below.

### The trend has formed with a clear direction

If the trend is up, the lines are arranged in the following order: The
green one is on the top; next comes the red line, and the blue one is
the lowest. All three lines are directed up. As the trend develops, the
distance between the lines is increasing.

In a downtrend, the lines are arranged in the opposite order. The jaw
line is at the top, below is the teeth line, and the lip line is the
lowest. Likewise, all three lines are directed down. As the downtrend
develops, the distance between the lines is increasing.

### Alligator working principle

The Alligator trading strategy suggests that you should watch the
arrangement of lines in the chart. You need to learn to identify the
market state – when the Alligator sleeps and when it is waking up. It is
important to filter signals generated by the Williams indicator to
increase the number of profitable trades.

## How it is Calculated - Williams Alligator Formula

The Williams Alligator is calculated according to the following formula:

MEDIAN PRICE = (HIGH + LOW) / 2

ALLIGATORS JAW = SMMA (MEDIAN PRICE, 13, 8)

ALLIGATORS TEETH = SMMA (MEDIAN PRICE, 8, 5)

ALLIGATORS LIPS = SMMA (MEDIAN PRICE, 5, 3)

Where:

MEDIAN PRICE — median price;

HIGH — bar’s high;

LOW — bar’s low;

 SMMA (MEDIAN PRICE, A, B) - smoothed moving average of the median
price, where parameter A is the smoothing period, parameter B is a shift
to the future;

Example: SMMA (MEDIAN PRICE, 13, 8) means that a smoothed moving average
is calculated from the median price with a period of 13 and a shift of
8.

ALLIGATORS JAW — Jaws

ALLIGATORS TEETH — Teeth

ALLIGATORS LIPS — Lips

Based on this formula, we see that the value of each indicator line can
be calculated manually. However, Alligator is present in every trading
platform by default, so there is no need to calculate these values
yourself.

## What signals are provided by the Alligator?

The Alligator indicator shows the market state at any given time. It
shows when the market is trading flat, when there appears momentum and
when this price momentum starts and ends. The latter is the most
important because you should open a position as close as possible to the
beginning of the trend and at the most favorable price, and then close
it together with most large players.

In a trading range, the Alligator's "mouth" is closed. With the
beginning of the trend, it begins to "open up" and "eat.” Let's take a
look at what signals the Alligator generates.

I will divide the Alligator signals into three groups. Each of the
groups describes a certain state of the market at the current moment.

### The Alligator is sleeping

The consolidation state of the market is characterized by the closed
mouth of the Alligator. The lines of the lips, teeth, and jaws are
interwoven.

Each next to the other. In approximately the same place on the chart.
The lines do not indicate a specific direction, they are located in the
horizontal plane.

The sleeping state is characterized by a flat, the formation of an
accumulation zone, as large traders are adding up to the trades.

### The Alligator is waking up

After the traders accumulate positions, a weak price movement begins. At
this moment, the mouth begins to open. The price chart crosses the
Alligator line in a particular direction. Then the lines begin to line
up in the trend direction, one after another: first is the green line,
then — the red one, teeth and lips, and then — the blue one, the jaw.

Suppose the price is above or below all the indicator lines and the
moving averages already indicate a specific direction. In that case,
they point in one direction, then the Alligator has woken up, and the
hunt will begin soon. It's time to look for an entry point.

### The Alligator is eating

If the momentum is supported by other traders, then the mouth begins to
open wider and wider. The lines of the lips, teeth, and jaws point in
the same direction. The distance between the lines starts to increase.

There is a clear trend in the chart. The strength of this trend will be
proportional to the time the Alligator slept. The longer the market has
been in the accumulation zone, the stronger the momentum will be.

At this moment, you cannot open positions against the trend. Traders who
enter trades against the trade by mistake are doomed to failure. When
Alligator is eating, nothing will stop it.

When the Alligator is eating, you should trade only in the trend
direction, using strong support levels to enter the market: the lines of
the lips, teeth, and jaws.

After the Alligator is full, the market calms down, the lines lose
direction and begin to intertwine with each other. The market needs a
break, and the Alligator falls asleep at that moment.

## Examples of the Williams [Alligator Indicator](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/alligator.html)

The above figure displays the hourly timeframes of the [BRENT][2] oil
price chart. In the hourly timeframe, I prefer using the following
settings of the indicator 21;13;8, but I will cover it in detail later.

### Example of trading with the Alligator indicator

On the left side of the chart in the above picture, we see that the
Alligator is waking up, a buy signal appears, followed by a powerful
uptrend that characterizes the stage when the Alligator is eating with
an open mouth.

After some time, the price tests two lines of the indicator: green and
red, but the direction of these lines is still up, so the market grows
by a few more points.

Next, the price breaks through the Alligator lines and updates the local
minimum. The lip line crosses the teeth and jaw line, signaling the end
of the uptrend. It's time to take the profit.

The next stage of the Alligator trading is sleeping. At this stage, the
market is trading flat. It is not recommended to trade in the sideways
trend.

After sleeping, the Alligator is awakening. The mouth begins to open,
and another uptrend starts. When the green line is above the red one and
the red is above the blue, and the price is trading above all the
Alligator lines, a buy signal is generated.

Open a long position at the start of an uptrend. The mouth opens, the
Alligator is eating.

When the price hits the highest high in the chart, the price enters a
consolidation range. The green line crosses the red one, and the red
line crosses the blue one. The Alligator is falling asleep.

The Alligator begins to wake up when the distance between the lines
begins to increase. On the right side of the chart, we see that the
price is trading below the lines, and they acquire a downward direction.
It is a sell signal in the Alligator trading strategy.

The downtrend does not last long, and the lines cross each other in the
opposite direction. It is time to exit short trades and turn up. Here,
the Alligator doesn’t rest and right away starts hunting. The last buy
signal appears on the right side of the chart, immediately after the
sales are closed.

## How to Use the [Alligator Indicator](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/alligator.html) in Forex Trading

Alligator [trading strategies](https://www.fintechee.com/forex-trading-strategies/) come into two groups. The first type of
trading with the Bill Williams’ Alligator indicator suggests you don’t
use any additional tools. The second type of trading strategy employs
additional filters to spot entry points. Employing auxiliary indicators
reduces the number of false signals and gives an opportunity to enter
the market with additional confirmation.

To begin with, let's consider the classic use of the Alligator without
using other analysis tools. That is, the indicator is used in its
original form.

Open the chart of any trading instrument in the LiteForex [Personal
Profile][3]. I will use the gold price chart as an example.

It is clear from the chart, the ([XAUUSD][4]) has been trading in a
downtrend up to now. All the attempts to drive the price up have been
absorbed. When the price was above the Alligator lines, the lines
themselves didn’t change their direction. That is, it has been relevant
to sell gold up to now.

At the end of the trading session on January 18, 2021 – the beginning of
the trading session on January 19, 2021, the Alligator fell asleep. This
market state is characterized by uncertainty, and one shouldn’t enter
trades during this time.

Starting from the European trading session, the Alligator begins to wake
up, the lines start to line up. During the first trading hours of the
European session, the price closes above the Alligator's mouth. We
notice this moment and decide to look for an entry point to buy gold.

Starting at 13:00 terminal time on January 19, the price begins to
decline to test the support area formed by the Alligator lines. After
the price tested the area of lines congestion (support), and after the
candlestick closed right at the levels at 14:00, we decide to open a
long position with a stop loss below the local low of January 18 at
1828.94. The position opening price is 1838.15.

There is no trading activity at the US session; the market participants
are accumulating trading volume.

On the new trading day of January 20, the market closes at the price
rise. At the European session, there was a try to reverse the trend
down.

However, the price doesn’t break out the Alligator mouth lines, namely,
the Jaw line. The trend continues. Just before the US session, the trade
is exited with a Take Profit at 1862.0.

This Take Profit level was not chosen randomly. This is the level of the
previous local highs. The target of an uptrend is to break through the
important high.

As we use the Alligator indicator alone, without any additional filters,
the stop-loss orders should be placed beyond the local lows and highs,
depending on the trend. Take Profit levels are set at the breakthrough
of important high and lows.

The result of the trade is in the screenshot:

Risking 1% of the deposit, we can afford to enter a trade of 0.45 lots.
The ratio between profit and potential loss (Reward/Risk) was 2.59.

## Alligator indicator download

You can download the Alligator indicator for the MetaTrader on the
MetaQuotes official [website](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/website-for-forex-trading/).

By default, the indicator uses the following parameters: period = 21,
13, 8; shift = 13, 8, 5. MA Method: Smoothed. Apply to: Median Price (HL
/ 2).

## Alligator and [Fractals](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/fractals.html) Trading Strategy

This strategy is a part of Bill Williams Profitunity trading strategy.
Profundity could be a bit complicated for beginner traders, but the
Alligator and [Fractals](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/fractals.html) trading strategy will suit traders of any level.

The [Fractals](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/fractals.html) indicator perfectly complements the Alligator. The combined
application of the two Williams’s indicators provides accurate entry
points, with the [Fractals](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/fractals.html) tool serving as an additional filter. You
enter a trade at the fractal breakout when the market trend has already
acquired a direction.

### Alligator and [Fractals](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/fractals.html) strategy description

This is a trend-following strategy. You spot the moments when the price
momentum begins and try to enter at the momentum inception. When the
market is trading flat, neither the Alligator alone nor the combination
with [Fractals](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/fractals.html) will not work.

The strategy works on any financial instrument, be it forex,
commodities, or cryptocurrencies. The [best time](https://www.fixpro.org/post/forex-best-time-to-trade/)frames to apply are H1,
H4 and D1. In shorter timeframes, there will be many signals, but the
quality of such signals will be bad: a lot of market noise, a lot of
false signals. Using the W1 timeframe, you will have to expect an entry
signal for weeks or even months.

### Indicator settings

Let us see the optimal settings to trade with the Alligator and [Fractals](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/fractals.html)
indicators on the H1 timeframe, which allows us to trade intraday or
hold trades for three days.

I recommend using the following settings for the Alligator indicator:

  * Jaws period = 21; shift = 13;

  * Teeth period = 13; shift = 8;

  * Lips period = 8; shift = 5.

You can choose the colors and the thickness of the lines as you want.
The most important is that it is comfortable for you to analyze the
chart, and the indicator doesn’t prevent you from seeing bars.

The [Fractals](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/fractals.html) indicator looks like an arrow above the Japanese
candlestick up or below the candlestick down on the chart. It indicates
the high or low of the price.

An upward fractal will form after several conditions are fulfilled:

  1. The highs of the first two candlesticks increase.

  2. The third candlestick has a high above the previous ones.

  3. The fourth and fifth candlesticks have successively decreasing highs.

  4. After that, a fractal icon is formed at the highest price.

For the formation of a downward fractal, the opposite conditions should
be met.

The [Fractals](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/fractals.html) indicator does not require setting parameters. You only
need to set the display color and size of the icons.

### How to enter a buy trade

To enter a buy trade, the Alligator should be waking up. The lip line
should break through the teeth line upside, and the teeth line should
cross the jaw line from bottom to top.

This will signal that there should be an entry point to open a position
following an uptrend.

Next, you need to find the two nearest fractals: one upper, the other
lower.

You wait for the moment when the hourly candlestick breaks through the
last formed upward fractal and closes above the high. At this moment,
you open a buy position.

### Stop Loss and Take Profit for a long trade

First of all, we determine the place of placing Stop Loss. It is placed
below the low of the last formed descending fractal.

We calculate the Take Profit price in such a way that the distance from
the trade entry point is twice as long as the distance to the stop loss.

There are other variations of setting Take Profit: at the breakthrough
of any significant high, at a distance three times greater than Stop
Loss, at a strong level of a longer timeframe, etc. I usually use the
method described above. A take profit of two times larger than the
potential stop is not bad, and you shouldn't be greedy.

### How to enter a sell trade?

To enter a sell trade, the Alligator lines should start sloping down,
and the Alligator should be waking up. The Lip line should be below the
Teeth, and the Teeth should be below Jaw. The price should be trading
below all the Alligator lines.

Next, we look at the last two formed fractals: an upward and a downward
one.

Expect when the hourly candlestick breaks through the most recent
downward fractal and closes below. Open a sell position at this moment.

### Stop Loss and Take Profit for a short trade

A stop loss is set above the high of the most recent upward fractal.

The Take Profit is set at the distance twice as much that of the stop
loss.

### Moving the trade to the breakeven

The trade is moved to the breakeven, according to this strategy, when
the Jaw line (the blue one) is below the entry price for a sell trade
and above the entry price for a buy trade.

Why should you move the order to the breakeven zone in this case? It is
because the Jal line is responsible for the trend border in the
timeframe you trade. If the line is broken out, the trend is likely to
change.

In this case, you should look for an entry in the opposite direction.
There is no point in holding the trade even if the Stop Loss is set
beyond the blue.

### Closing the position manually

The strategy suggests not every trade will reach the set Take Profit,
and it is normal. If the market conditions change unexpectedly, traders
exit trades manually.

Let us explore such conditions:

  1. Alligator falls asleep. This pattern of indicator behavior suggests that the trend has been exhausted, and it is not clear whether it will continue in the future. It is better not to risk, and when a new signal appears in the same direction, enter a new trade.

  2. Price breaks through the Jaws line. This indicates a possible trend change. If the price consolidates above the jaws blue line and continues to move in a new direction, the Alligator lines will begin to rebuild and indicate a new direction for trading.

Some traders close the trade manually if the instrument reaches the
important and strong level on the longer timeframe chart. Another reason
to exit a trade manually if the price passes the average [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) move
(suitable for intraday traders). There could be other conditions. Here
everything becomes individual, and you should act, according to your
trading system.

### Additional conditions to enter trades

  1. The candlestick, on which the Signal Fractal was formed, should not touch the Alligator indicator lines. If the candlestick, on which the fractal was formed, touches the indicator, then such a fractal is considered invalid, and the signal is not traded.

  2. To enter a buy trade, the price must be above all indicator lines.

  3. To enter a sell trade, the price must be below all indicator lines.

## Best Alligator indicator settings

Different Alligator indicator settings apply to trading in different
timeframes. I should note that the longer is the timeframe, the more
reliable are the signals generated. But in this case, there will be
fewer signals. And vice versa, the shorter is the timeframe, the more
there will be signals, but the false signals will be numerous.

### Alligator settings for H1 timeframe and shorter

Personally, I prefer to use the indicator on the H1 timeframe. This is
the optimal timeframe for short-term trading with a trade holding time
of 1 to 5 days. A moderate amount of market noise, combined with
frequent and clear signals for currency pairs, makes it possible to
focus on a few popular instruments and trade without psychological
stress.

The best Alligator settings for the H1 timeframe:

  * Jaws period = 21; shift = 13;

  * Teeth period = 13; shift = 8;

  * Lips period = 8; shift = 5.

These are the Alligator indicator default parameters offered in the
[LiteForex][3] client profile.

### Alligator settings for the timeframes of H4 and longer

On the timeframes of 4 hours and longer, there is less market noise;
therefore, more reliable trading signals from any forex indicators
appear. The drawback is that it takes more time to wait for the signal.

To compensate for this disadvantage, the Alligator indicator should be
used with the standard parameters recommended by Bill Williams:

  * Jaws period = 13; shift = 8;

  * Teeth period = 8; shift = 5;

  * Lips period = 5; shift = 3.

These are the generally accepted Alligator settings. Any MetaTrader
terminal offers such parameters by default.

### Alligator indicator — settings for M5 timeframe

You can apply the Alligator with the standard parameters of 13;8;5. But
there will be many false signals in this case. You will need additional
tools, for example, oscillators or the [Fractals](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/fractals.html) indicator, to filter out
false signals.

Let's go the other way and take the periods even longer than with the
settings for the H1 timeframe. We shall take the following numbers from
the Fibonacci sequence: 34 for the period and 21 for the shift into the
future.

Alligator optimal settings for a five-minute timeframe:

  * Jaws period = 34; shift = 21;

  * Teeth period = 21; shift = 13;

  * Lips period = 13; shift = 8.

In this case, there is a “slow” indicator but in the “fast’ timeframe.
These settings reduce the market noise and filter signals. With these
settings, you will get a couple of reliable signals for day trading,
which is still good for a day trader.

### Summary of Alligator settings

If you want to adjust Alligator settings to different timeframes, you
should perfectly understand this indicator’s work principles. It should
be borne in mind that the shorter the working timeframe, the greater
values should be set for the indicator formula. The longer the
timeframe, the smaller the values can be set into the formula. You need
to change the Alligator indicator parameters to filter false signals and
reduce the influence of “market noise.”

> Before applying the new Alligator parameters in real trading, you need
to test them on a demo account or on [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) data. A manual strategy
tester will suit the best.

## Pros and Cons of Alligator trading

The Alligator indicator allows a trader to define the ongoing market
trend. It generates the entry points at the momentum inception and
signals the trend exhaustion.

You can think that the Alligator is a complete trading strategy, but it
is not so. You need additional filters to detail the entry and exit
points. For example, you can employ oscillators or other tools, such as
[Fractals](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/fractals.html) or Price Action patterns, volume indicators, and so on.

Listed below, there are primary advantages and disadvantages of the
Alligator, for you to decide if the Alligator trading strategy suits you
or not.

It is included in most trading platforms by default

It is clear from the above chart that the Alligator has more advantages
than disadvantages. Alligator is a straightforward indicator, included
in most trading platforms by default. This suggests that even a beginner
can trade with the Alligator. However, for more profitable and
comfortable trading, a newbie will have to master other analytical tools
in order to detail entry points and filter false signals.

Bill Williams' Alligator indicator identifies the trend, flat and the
flat end, which is an undoubted advantage over other indicators that
often lag behind and generate a signal when the price has already passed
a large number of pips in the chart. It turns out that when trading with
the Alligator, you take almost the entire trend movement. When you trade
with most other indicators, you enter the market at the trend’s end and
could face the risks of the trend reversal and closing a position by
stop.

A significant flaw is that you need to adjust the Alligator parameters
for each timeframe individually. Of course, you can use default
settings. However, with this approach, there will be a lot of signals in
short timeframes, half of which will be false. In long timeframes, on
the contrary, there will be fewer signals, and you will have to wait for
entry signals for a long time.

I have collected for you comments written by real traders on the various
forums where Alligator is discussed:



Summing up the pros and cons section, I want to emphasize the following:
Alligator is not suitable for all traders. However, I suggest everyone
should study and try to use the Alligator. At least, studying the
Alligator will be useful for self-development and understanding of the
working principles.

Most of the positive reviews boil down to the fact that the Alligator
indicator is simple and its signals are clear. There is no double
interpretation. It is clear when to open a buy or sell position and when
to close.

Critics argue that Alligator was developed for the stock market a long
time ago. It will not work alone, and you will lose your deposit in the
flat. It is based on the moving averages, i.e., it is the derivatives of
MAs. And the moving averages themselves are already a derivative of the
price.

As with any analytical tool and any trading strategy, there are many
followers and many haters. If there were a 100% working instrument, then
there would be no market and free trade :) Therefore, it is only your
decision whether to trade with the Alligator or not.
