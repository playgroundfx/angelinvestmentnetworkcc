Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 25.03.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

Ripple and Ethereum are forming final zigzags in ending diagonals, and
Bitcoin is forming the final impulse wave of the bullish trend.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

Bitcoin is forming the bullish impulse. The upward impulse wave 3 has
completed, and the corrective wave 4 also looks complete. Wave 4 is a
simple bearish zigzag [a]-[b]-[c], where [a] and [c] are impulses, and
wave [b] is a triple zigzag. Therefore, there has just begun the final
fave 5, which could be unfolding as a simple five-wave impulse. The next
target for purchases is 57260.00, where correction (4) finished.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 52454.00, TP 57260.00

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

The upward wave (C), an element of the simple zigzag (A)-(B)-(C), could
be unfolding as an ending diagonal. The corrective down wave 4 should
have completed as a double zigzag, and there is developing the beginning
of the final wave 5. Wave 5 should be developing as a simple zigzag
[a]-[b]-[c], as it is outlined in the chart. Therefore, the Ripple price
should be rising to level 0.645.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] today:

Buy 0.487, TP 0.645

* * *

## Elliott wave Ethereum analysis

As the ETHUSD market fell deeper than previously expected, we could
conclude that wave (5) is an ending diagonal rather than an impulse. The
corrective down wave 4 finished lower than wave 1. If the assumption is
correct, the price should soon be rising in the upward wave 5,
developing as a zigzag [a]-[b]-[c]. The structure of wave 5 is outlined
in the chart. One could enter purchases with a target at 1870.00, the
previous high made by correction [b].

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Buy 1568.32, TP 1870.00
