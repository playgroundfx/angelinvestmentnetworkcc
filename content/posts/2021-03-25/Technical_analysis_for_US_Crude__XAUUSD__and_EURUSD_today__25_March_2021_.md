Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 25.03.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

Yesterday was marked by a corrective growth of WTI oil. At the close of
the US trading session, the correction turned into a new short-term
uptrend.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

Yesterday was marked by a corrective growth of WTI oil's price. At the
close of the US trading session, the correction turned into a new short-
term uptrend. The bulls managed to break out the Intermediary Zone 60.04
- 59.78 and consolidate the price above. This means that the target for
purchases is now the Target Zone 62.84 - 62.33.

A price decline and a test of the Additional Zone 60.04 - 59.91 can now
be seen. Consider purchases according to the pattern in this zone and
take a part of the profits at yesterday's high. The second area to look
for purchases is Intermediary Zone 58.76 - 58.51.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

  1. Buy according to the pattern in Additional Zone 60.04 - 59.91. TakeProfit: 61.22, Target Zone 62.84 - 62.33. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. Buy according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 58.76 - 58.51. TakeProfit: 61.22, Target Zone 62.84 - 62.33. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

Gold cannot break out the Additional Zone 1730 - 1728, despite all the
efforts of traders. But the market does not provide a buy pattern
either. Continue watching the price chart.

If the resistance level of 1740 is broken out, there will be an
opportunity to buy gold with the targets at level 1755 and the Target
Zone 1786 - 1776.

A breakout of support at 1726 will mean a deep gold correction down to
the Intermediary Zone 1705 - 1700.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

  1. Buy when level 1740 is broken out. TakeProfit: 1755, Target Zone 1786 - 1776. StopLoss: beyond the local low.

  2. Sell when level 1726 is broken out. TakeProfit: 1700. StopLoss: beyond the local high.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

Yesterday, the euro/dollar pair reached the Target Zone 1.1830 - 1.1813.
The price didn't break out the zone, so a further price fall to the Gold
Zone 1.1750 - 1.1742 is not possible.

But we can consider euro sales according to the pattern in strong
resistances: the Additional Zone 1.1848 - 1.1844 and the Intermediary
Zone 1.1892 - 1.1884. The target for sales will be the day's local low.

For euro purchasing, a trend reversal by breaking out the Intermediary
Zone and the price consolidation higher at the US trading session are
required.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

  1. Sell according to the pattern in Additional Zone 1.1848 - 1.1844. TakeProfit: 1.1805. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. Sell according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 1.1892 - 1.1884. TakeProfit: 1.1805. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.
