Dollar is humiliated. EURUSD forecast 23.12.2020Dmitri Demidenko

The 45th President of the United States demands Congress to reconsider
the $900 billion bill it has passed and threatens not to sign it. How
will this affect the dynamics of [EURUSD][1]? Let's discuss this and
create a trading plan.

## Weekly US dollar fundamental forecast

Many traders prefer technical analysis to fundamental analysis not
because they trust the charts. In their opinion, fundamental analysis is
just too complex. Indeed, after Congress approved an $892 billion fiscal
stimulus, Capital Economics and Oxford Economics raised their forecasts
for US GDP for 2021 by 0.5-1 percentage points, the IMF warned that due
to the spread of COVID-19 in Europe it will be forced to lower its
eurozone GDP estimates, yet the forecast for [EURUSD][1] is still
bullish! Donald Trump threatens not to sign the fiscal stimulus bill,
thus depriving the economy of financial aid, but the greenback is
rising. Finally, rumours are heard in the market that if Joe Biden and
Janet Yellen abandon their strong dollar policies, the USD Index will
skyrocket. Where is the logic? In fact, fundamental analysis is simple.

In times of recession and in the post-crisis period, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s have a
heightened sense of global risk appetite, so all events should be viewed
through the [S&P 500][2] perspective and the inverse correlation of the
stock index with the US dollar. If the US economy accelerates thanks to
the new fiscal stimulus, it would be good [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) for stocks but bad [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/)
for the greenback as a safe-haven asset. When Donald Trump brings
confusion with his intention not to sign the bill approved by the
Congress, the [S&P 500][2] falls and pulls [EURUSD][1] down with it. The
White House's abandonment of the strong dollar [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) will be a blow to
the financial markets that are used to it. Now let's wait for the
correction of stock indices and the strengthening of the dollar. It's
simple, isn't it?

As for the IMF warnings about the reduction of forecasts for the
eurozone GDP for 2020 (-8.3%) and 2021 (+ 5.2%) due to the spread of
COVID-19 in the Old World, this is a matter of the euro, not the US
dollar. Investors firmly believe in the victory over the pandemic with
vaccines, in the acceleration of the global economy and international
trade next year. Well, forecasts may be adjusted both for the worse and
for the better.

### IMF GDP Forecasts for 2020

Despite the loud statements of Donald Trump who called the fiscal
stimulus bill a disgrace and demanded to increase checks for Americans
from $600 to $2,000, many [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s consider the 45th President's trick
as a show-off. At the same time, the quiet reaction of the [S&P 500][2]
indicates that financial markets are confident that the document will be
signed.

The same can be said about Brexit, which, along with the global risk
appetite, is currently the key driver of [EURUSD][1] price changes. The
EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier calls Britain's proposal that it
should have 35-60% of the €650 million in European fishermen's revenues
unacceptable, but the pound is not falling. It looks like [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s
continue to believe in a last-minute trade.

### Trading plan for [EURUSD][1] for the week

The second attempt of [EURUSD][1] to consolidate above the previously
indicated resistance at 1.224-1.2245 was not successful. Will there be a
third time? Or will the market decide to calm down on the eve of
Christmas and go into short-term consolidation in the range of
1.2085-1.2245? In my opinion, the latter option is more likely. Time to
relax?
