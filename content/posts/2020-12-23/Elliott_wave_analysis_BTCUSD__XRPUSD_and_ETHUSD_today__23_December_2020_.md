Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 23.12.2020Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I suggest entry signals
to trade each cryptocurrency.

Apparently, Ripple is not forming a triangle, as was supposed earlier,
but a triple zigzag.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

 ****

In the last section of the chart, a bullish impulse wave is forming.
Sub-waves 1 and 2 were formed, then the price began to rise in impulse
3. At the moment, sub-waves [1]-[2]-[3]-[4] have been fully completed,
and wave [5] is still forming. In the coming days, the market will rise
in sub-waves 3-4-5 of a smaller degree, as shown in the chart. The end
of the bullish impulse is expected around the 26000.00 level. Consider
opening longs.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 23745.50 TP 26000.00

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

 ****

As the market continued to go down, the previous analysis has lost its
relevance. Most likely, corrective wave [4] takes the form of a bearish
triple zigzag (W)-(X)-(Y)-(XX)-(Z), the first four parts of which have
already been completed, and the last subwave (Z) is forming... Wave (Z)
takes the shape of a standard a-b-c zigzag. Now the price is going down
in impulse c, while the impulse itself is close to being completed.
Perhaps the price will reach the level of 0.338, after which the market
will reverse and begin to form a new upward trend.

### Trading plan for **[XRPUSD][2]** today:

Sell 0.399, TP 0.338

* * *

## Elliott wave Ethereum analysis

 ****

Ethereum continues to form a bullish wave 5 which will complete a large
impulse (3). Wave 5 is an impulse consisting of sub-waves
[1]-[2]-[3]-[4]-[5]. Most likely, the corrective wave [4] has recently
been completed, it took the form of a bearish double zigzag (w)-(x)-(y).
After that, the price reversed and started going up in the initial part
of wave [5]. A price increase is expected in the near future. The first
target for opening trades is the level of 677.00, that is, the previous
high formed by wave [3].

### Trading plan for  **[ETHUSD][3] **today:

Buy 625.55, TP 677.00
