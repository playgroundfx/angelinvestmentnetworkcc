Senate will determine gold trend. Forecast as of 10.12.2020Dmitri
Demidenko

Despite the favorable environment, the demand for gold is declining.
What will support gold, and what will press it down in 2021? Let us
analyze the gold outlook and make up a [XAUUSD][1] trading plan.

## Monthly gold fundamental forecast

Gold traders respect those who give money to the financial markets. They
are the Fed, having surprised [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s with cheap liquidity flows in
the spring, and the Democrats, willing to provide a bigger fiscal
stimulus than the Conservatives. Once the risk of a ‘blue wave’ started
declining after the US presidential election, the gold has started
falling in value and reached one of the targets set in [late autumn][2],
the level of $1775. The drop was followed by a rise, once the Congress
had returned to the idea of a fresh stimulus package.

Technically, the current environment is favorable for the [XAUUSD][1]
bulls. According to Bloomberg, the Fed, the ECB, the Bank of Japan, and
the Bank of England have spent $5.6 trillion on quantitative easing in
2020. These central banks are willing to hold the bond yields low for
quite a long time to support the global economic recovery. The US dollar
outlook for 2021 is bearish amid the lower demand for safe havens and US
securities. Although the central banks will hardly pour the same amount
of cheap money into the financial system shortly, and gold won’t hit new
all-time highs, but the XAUUSD can still go up.

On the other hand, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s lose interest in gold, despite the
favorable environment, and look for alternative investments—for example,
the [BTCUSD][3]. Unlike gold, highly demanded by the Baby Boomers, the
new generation worships cryptocurrency. According to JP Morgan,
institutional [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s have just started recognizing [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/), while the
demand for gold [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/)s is fading away. Since early October, the capital
inflow into the exchange-traded securities of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust
has accounted for $2 billion. The capital outflow from gold [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/)s has
been $7 billion over the same period.

I don’t think it’s time to give up on gold now. But it is not relevant
to add up to gold longs as well. A weak US dollar and the Fed’s
willingness to hold the bond yields low are positive for the [XAUUSD][1]
bulls. However, they lack the reflation environment to continue the
rally. The reflation would occur if Congress provides the US economy
with a massive fiscal stimulus and continue to support economic
recovery. Joe Biden believes that whatever the amount of aid in 2020
will be, it is just the beginning of a huge boost. It will come true
unless anything stops the new US president.

###  ** **Monthly gold trading plan****

Who or what can set Biden’s developments back? The major enemy of gold
now is the Senate majority leader Mitchell McConnell. However, if the
Democrats get the two remaining seats in US Congress's upper house,
McConnell’s power will end. If so, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s will return to the idea of
a reflation environment, and the gold uptrend will resume. Otherwise,
the [XAUUSD][1] trend will turn down in 2021. The election results will
be announced in mid-January. Until then, gold is likely to enter a
consolidation range of $1770-$1 890 per ounce. Traders should sell gold
on the price rise towards the upper border of the trading channel; it
will be relevant to buy on the price fall towards the lower border.
