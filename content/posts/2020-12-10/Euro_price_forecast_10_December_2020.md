Euro is doomed to success. Forecast as of EURUSD 10.12.2020Dmitri
Demidenko

The [EURUSD][1] could roll down because of the correction of the US
stock indexes or a no-deal Brexit but not the European central bank. Let
us discuss the Forex prospects and make up a trading plan.

## Monthly euro fundamental forecast

The first pandemic wave damaged badly financial markets; the second
wave, more destructive, has not affected the markets much. On the
contrary, the world stock indexes are growing amid the hopes for
vaccines. The associated confidence in the rapid recovery of the global
economy in 2021 makes [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s search for alternatives to the US
assets, supporting the money outflow from the US and weakening the US
dollar. The paradox is the [EURUSD][1] rally presses down the euro-area
exports. The great share of exports in the European GDP doesn’t allow
rapid growth of corporate profits, making the euro-area securities less
appealing for [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s than the US assets. Since the beginning of the
year, the [S&P 500][2] has been 15% up, while the [EuroStoxx 50][3] has
been 5% down. How could the money be out-flowing from the US?

In fact, European stocks do not always fall when the euro rises.
According to Goldman Sachs, the current situation resembles the events
of 2012-2014, when assets were on the same road, also because of the
expectations for the QE start by the ECB. The company believes that the
economic recovery will be a stronger driver for corporations than
exports. So, the euro strengthening won’t hit the corporate profits.
Goldman Sachs suggests the corporate incomes will grow by 30% in 2021
and by 20% in 2022. The [EURUSD][1] should be at 1.25 next year.

### Dynamics of the correlation between the [EURUSD][1] and [EuroStoxx
50][3]

A weaker US dollar improves international financial conditions, creating
a tailwind for international trade and is more significant for European
exports than a strengthening euro. Simultaneously, the ECB's tight
control over the euro-area bond market is another important driver for
the European stocks’ growth.

If Christine Lagarde and her colleagues at the December 10 meeting
expand the emergency asset purchase program by €500 billion, as
Bloomberg experts expect, this will be enough to buy 70% of all bonds
that the governments of the eurozone countries plan to issue in 2021,
according to Pictet Wealth Management. The ECB already owns 43% of all
German debt and every second out of five Italian securities. These
figures have skyrocketed since the end of 2019, when they were 30% and
25%, respectively. As a result, quarterly yield spreads are the tightest
since the previous global financial crisis.

### Monthly [EURUSD][1] trading plan

The ECB controls the yields just like the Bank of Japan does, although
it is not announced. The more monetary stimulus the ECB adds, the better
the environment will be created for the European stocks and the euro.
Even if the Governing Council reaches the 2% inflation target, which is
unlikely, it will also be positive [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) for the euro. Whatever Christine
Lagarde does, the [EURUSD][1] will be going up. The bulls could be
discouraged by the correction of the US stock indexes or a no-deal
Brexit. However, following the ECB meeting, it will be relevant to buy
the pair on the price fall. The upside targets will be at 1.224 and
1.235.
