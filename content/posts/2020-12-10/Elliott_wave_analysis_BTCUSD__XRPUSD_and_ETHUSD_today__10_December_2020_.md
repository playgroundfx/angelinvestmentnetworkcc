Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 10.12.2020Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I suggest entry signals
to trade each cryptocurrency.

The market has finished forming corrective waves for all cryptocurrency
pairs covered in the article. Therefore, the market should start rising
in new bullish impulse waves.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

 ****

There is forming the final leg of the large bullish impulse C. Wave [5]
is developing as an impulse composed of five sub-waves. The long-term
corrective wave (4) must have finished as a zigzag a-b-c, where wave b
is a double zigzag. Therefore, the price should be rising in wave (5),
which should conclude the entire uptrend. The first target is level
19458.52, marked by the correction b.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 18446.00 TP 19458.52

* * *

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

 ****

The Ripple market is forming the impulse wave C. The corrective wave [4]
must have finished as a zigzag (a)-(b)-(c), where the (b) wave is a
double zigzag, and the (c) wave is a truncated impulse. There is now
forming the initial element of the final impulse wave. The price should
be rising to a level above 0.625. One could enter long positions in the
current situation.

### Trading plan for **[XRPUSD][2]** today:

Buy 0.571, TP 0.625

* * *

## Elliott wave Ethereum analysis

 ****

The ETHUSD market continues forming the bullish impulse C, with the
final wave [5] developing inside. In the most recent chart section, the
market has completed the bearish corrective wave (4) as triple zigzag
w-x-y-xx-z. Therefore, the Ethereum price should be rising to a level
above 606.67. I recommend entering buy trades in the current situation.

### Trading plan for  **[ETHUSD][3] **today:

Buy 567.33, TP 606.67
