Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 10.03.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

Oil has worked out a first-priority downward pattern: it reached the
lower Target Zone [63.32 - 62.87].

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

Oil has worked out a first-priority downward pattern: it reached the
lower Target Zone [63.32 - 62.87]. Further price fall will be possible
if the price consolidates below level 62.87 at the US session. The
target will be the Gold Zone [61.06 - 60.83].

It is profitable to consider new oil sales on the correction. Additional
Zone [64.33 - 64.22] and Intermediary Zone [65.57 - 65.35] are among the
strong resistances at the moment. Wait for the correction and look for a
pattern for opening a position. The target will be the day's low.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

  1. Sell according to the pattern in Additional Zone [64.33 - 64.22]. TakeProfit: 63.12. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. Sell according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone [65.57 - 65.35]. TakeProfit: 63.12. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

Gold has broken out the level of 1713. Therefore, shortly, expect a test
of the Intermediary Zone [1731 - 1726], which serves as the border of a
short-term downtrend. After the IZ test, look for a sell pattern to
enter a trade with a target at 1691.

The current support level of 1713 can be used for gold purchases. One
could enter purchases in the correction. To enter purchases in the
trend, the trend should turn up via the breakout of the resistance IZ.
In this case, the target will be large: the upper Target Zone [1786 -
1776].

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

  1. Buy according to the pattern in the level of 1713. TakeProfit: Intermediary Zone [1731 - 1726]. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. Sell according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone [1731 - 1726]. TakeProfit: 1691. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

Yesterday the euro price corrected to the area of the short-term
downtrend border [1.1923 - 1.1915]. The price didn't break out the zone.
Sales can be considered from today. To open a short position, it is
necessary to form a pattern, for example, a false breakout of the
previous high. The target for trades will be the March 9 low in the Gold
Zone [1.1842 - 1.1834].

A trend reversal is required for purchases. The trend will change if the
Intermediary Zone is broken out. In this situation, it is profitable to
buy the euro with the target at the upper Target Zone [1.2011 - 1.1995].

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

Sell according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone [1.1923 - 1.1915].
TakeProfit: 1.1835. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.
