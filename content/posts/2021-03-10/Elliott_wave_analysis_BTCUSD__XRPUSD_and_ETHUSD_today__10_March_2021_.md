Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 10.03.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

The BTCUSD and ETHUSD have started to form final legs in the large
double zigzags. Ripple continues forming the middle part of the bearish
zigzag.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

At the time of writing, the Bitcoin market is forming a double downward
zigzag [W]-[X]-[Y]. The upward linking wave [X] has completed as a
simple zigzag (A)-(B)-(C). There has started forming the final motive
wave [Y]. Therefore, the price should be declining over the next few
days. The first target to enter sell trades is at level 49220.00, made
by the small correction 4.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Sell 53817.50, TP 49220.00

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

The Ripple price chart continues forming the simple down zigzag
[A]-[B]-[C]. Impulse wave [A] has completed. There is now developing the
corrective wave [B] as a zigzag. There has completed the corrective wave
(B) as a double three, so the price should be rising in the impulse wave
(C). The market should be rising up to level 0.520, where corrective
wave [B] will be 50% of the [A] impulse.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] today:

Buy 0.460, TP 0.520

## Elliott wave Ethereum analysis

Like the BTCUSD, the ETHUSD continues forming the double downward zigzag
W-X-Y, with the linking upwave X completed inside. Wave X is a simple
zigzag composed of three sub-waves [A]-[B]-[C]. Therefore, the price
should be declining in the final motive wave Y over the next few days.
The next target to enter short trades is the low of 1660.00, marked by
the corrective wave (4).

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Sell 1776.75, TP 1660.00
