What affects gold prices? Exploring the Gold MarketGleb Kabanov

Gold is the most ancient legendary asset, humanity's curse and blessing.
The precious metal that was once used as money but has lost its appeal
in recent years. Loads of legends, fantasies, and rumours surround it.
The asset that can both yield profits and cause disappointment. This
article doesn't claim to be exhaustive, but we will try to find out what
drives gold prices and who is responsible for the fluctuation of gold
prices. Also, we discuss [how to](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-trading-how-to/) earn and save money when bying gold.

The article covers the following subjects:

Gold is a precious metal that once served as money, but in recent years
has lost its former attractiveness. The equivalent of value around which
many legends and unverified rumors revolve. Investing in this asset may
be profitable or disappointing.

### History and modern times

First, let's check the facts. As we know, the US dollar became the
world's reserve currency at the international conference held in Bretton
Woods, USA, in July 1944, when the Second World War was almost over.
Thus, other currencies became pegged to the USD's value, and their rate
was determined through the principle of parity. At the same time, the
dollar was pegged to gold, whose price was set at 35 USD per troy ounce
(31.1035 g). One gram of pure gold costs $1.125. Central banks
maintained currency parity. However, in 1968, the Two-tier gold system
was established, and the price of gold became dependent on demand and
supply.

In August 1971, US President Richard Nixon decided to close the gold
window and introduced a ban on USD-gold exchanges at an official bank
rate. The dollar devalued as early as December of the same year, and the
gold price rose to 38 USD. That meant the bankruptcy of the USA. Next,
the USA devalued the dollar to $42.2 per troy ounce, and the golden
standard era came to an end. Following the Jamaica Agreement in March
1976, the Forex market emerged, and the exchange rate system became
floating. Still, the dollar remained the world's reserve currency, which
allowed the USA to launch the printing press at its discretion later.

Forty-eight years have passed since then. One troy ounce grew in price
to $1,475, an impressive growth by 42.14 times or 4,214%! However, few
people think of investing and getting a return in 50 years. A closer
prospect of 5, 10, or 20 years is more appropriate. And traders are
interested in even shorter time frames: one year, one quarter, or even
one month. So, what affects the price of gold, and how do we determine
its direction? Let's try finding it out in this article.

## What factors affect gold prices?

Let's take a look at the main areas of gold production and consumption,
as well as analyze the supply and demand statistics.

When it comes to analyzing the price of gold, fundamental analysis is
more pertinent than technical analysis. The law of demand and supply
influences the price in the conditions of market price formation.

According to the World Gold Council's information (WGC), the primary
demand sources are jewelry production, the technological sector,
investment, and central banks (pic.1).

In 2018, jewellery production consumed 2,241 tons and technology - 335
tons. The investment sector bought 1,164 tons and central banks - 656
tons. Gold's new production amounted to 3,501 tons, and 1,177 tons were
recycled. In 2018, the leading gold producers were: China (404.1 tons),
Australia (314.9 tons), Russia (297.3 tons), and the USA (221.7 tons).

 _Pic. 1: Main consumers of gold_

Based on the WGC's data, the leading consumer of gold is jewelry
production with a 51% share. Also, we see that jewelry production has
been the main buyer for many years. It's supposed to affect the gold
price, but all isn't so simple. True, the gold price depends on the
demand for jewelry in the USA, India, and China, but this dependence
belongs to long-term factors. So does central banks' demand or growth of
electronics production.

### What drives gold prices?

I can single out four main categories of factors that affect the price
of gold:

  1. economic expansion and growth of well-being;
  2. market risks and uncertainty;
  3. alternative prices;
  4. impulse and positioning.

The two first factors are particularly important to gold prices' long-
term prospects. They form a basis for strategic reasons for buying and
investing in gold.

There's a connection between the price of gold and economic expansion.
Growth in people's well-being provokes a higher demand for jewelry. The
technological sector demands more gold too. Inflation incites [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s
to invest money in gold and gold-containing assets. In the USA, India,
and China, gold is an object of luxury and a store of value.

If a market, geopolitical, or any other risk arises, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s treat
gold as a safe-haven asset that protects them from money devaluation.
The price of gold is affected by central banks' policies and market
positioning, leading to huge growth or fall of this precious metal's
price.

There are multiple-factor models for assessing the prospects of gold.
They allow forecasting the direction of the price with high precision.
In such models, the price of gold is determined through the interactions
of drivers. However, those models' complexity and the absence of
reliable information prevent us from using them in everyday trading or
investment solutions. There will always be unknown variables that may
disprove a hypothesis and prevent the realization of a forecast. So, we
need a simple tool based on some assumptions, which is likely to make
the right forecast for gold in the Forex market.

## Gold market & Gold price trading economics: peculiarities of pricing
and structure

When trading commodities, it’s important to be aware of their
demand&supply’s structure and dynamics. A typical example is oil, which
is recovering lost positions by leaps and bounds amid expectations of
growing demand and surplus reduction, as main global economies have
started to reopen. Unlike Brent and WTI, gold is less sensitive to the
physical asset market’s state. However, it can punish any time a trader
who ignores fundamental analysis.

Jewellery production and investment prevail in the gold global demand
structure. In 2019, they accounted for 48.5% and 29.2% of demand,
respectively. Central banks’ share in gold purchases was 14.8% while
industrial use accounted for 7.5% of gold consumption. The latter
indicator is important. The thing is it is much higher for silver. The
shutdown of industrial enterprises led therefore to a faster slump of
[XAG/USD][1] if compared with [XAU/USD][2]. As a result, the gold-silver
ratio soared to [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) peaks. Against the backdrop of the recovering
global economy, the ratio may be expected to drop. It means we’d better
bet on silver’s faster growth against gold.

###  **Dynamics of global demand for gold**

 _Source: WGC._

The relative share of investment in the structure of the gold global
demand grew up to 49.8% while the share of jewelry production dropped to
30.1%. Consumption of gold reduced almost in all sectors, except for
[ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/)s and coins, as compared with October-December and January-March
2019.

###  **Dynamics of quarterly demand for gold**

 _Source: WGC._

A change in a demand structure is an important gold pricing factor. When
it happens, we may say a current trend is stable. The shift from jewelry
to investment is a clear sign of bulls’ market dominance.  Jewelry is
too expensive and its consumption is falling. On the contrary, the
faster [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/)s’ reserves grow, the higher their quotes are and the bigger
their buying army is. They sometimes say gold flows from east to west in
an uptrend. True, in 2019 the relative share of China and India in the
jewelry’s gold consumption structure was 67%, while the main [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/)s are
located in the USA, including the biggest fund SPDR Gold Shares, and
Europe.

The main producers of gold are China (404.1 t), Australia (314.9 t),
Russia (297.3 t), the USA (221.7 t), and other countries. Supply’s
influence on the price is limited. The year 2013 is a bright example.
Many said then XAU/USD quotes couldn’t drop below $1,300-1,350 per ounce
as it was gold producing companies’ break-even.  They said production
would be cut to provoke a deficit and price growth. But in fact,
existing hedging technologies allowed companies to fix the price and
continue producing the same volumes of gold. So, gold fell even below
the expected levels and buyers were punished for their extreme self-
confidence.

At the same time, supply shouldn’t be fully ignored. In 2020, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s
felt a critical shortage of physical assets when trading forwards amidst
the pandemic and shutdowns. As a result, gold premiums grew in the USA
and Europe and [XAU/USD][2] quotes rose as well.

###  **Dynamics of gold quotes in spot and forward market**

So, investment demand is an important factor in gold pricing. Its volume
is mostly affected by central banks’ monetary policies. Massive monetary
expansion contributes to weakening major currencies, dropping bond yield
and raising [XAU/USD][2] quotes.

## Speculators: London versus New York and Chicago

As I know from my practical experience, demand for so-called "paper
gold" is the main source of demand for gold that affects its price.
"Paper" gold means derivative instruments based on gold: futures in
commodity markets and shares in [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/)s. So, speculators influence the gold
price the most, even if their share in global demand is relatively small
in the short and medium-term (26%).

On the one hand, it's not suitable for [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s who face various kinds
of manipulations in the gold market. On the other hand, knowing that
fact makes simple traders' life easier: they only have to follow Managed
Money traders at Chicago and NY Mercantile Exchanges.

First, let's find out why the price of gold is formally determined in
London, but practically - at COMEX in the USA.

For many years it's been assumed that London accounts for the highest
gold trading volumes. That assumption wasn't confirmed because real
information was classified as secret. In autumn 2018, the London Bullion
Market Association (LBMA) published data on the gold trading volume
first time in [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/). According to the data, the trade volume was
4696.7 tons the week of 16 November or 939.37 tons on average in [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/)
[terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/). That volume was bigger than in Shanghai but yielded to the
conglomerate of Chicago and NY.

Here's a comparison of actual trade volumes in London and New York.
According to LBMA's information published on 16 December 2019, London’s
trade volume amounted to 160 million ounces the week of 11 December
2019. If we translate it into a futures contract, it makes 1,600,000
contracts (See pic. 2) At CME-COMEX, the volume was 1,719,000 contracts,
according to the stock exchange report over the same period.

 _Pic. 2: Weekly gold trading volume, LBMA_

So, London's gold trade volumes are comparable with the USA and saying
that London doesn't affect the price of gold would be a simplistic
approach. Still, we can't do without some simplifications because we
don't possess all the information on the parameters we are interested
in. What's more, all the markets are interconnected; that's why a change
in London's trades has an immediate impact on Chicago's trades, and
inversely. However, we can find a very interesting correlation that can
be used for analyzing the price of gold. We have to look at long
positions of Managed Money traders at COMEX.

## Commodity Futures Trading Commission and Commitments of Traders
Report

The thing is that the price of gold correlates with the dynamics of long
positions of COMEX traders (pic 3), and COMEX is accountable to the US
Commodity Futures Trading Commission – CFTC.[ According to the CFTC's
requirements][3], futures contract traders need to provide a Commitments
of Traders Report (CoT) to the CFTC. So, we can get [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) updates on
traders' actions in gold futures contracts and make relevant conclusions
by checking [traders' positions in СoТ reports][4].

According to Commodity Futures Trading Commission's classification, gold
is bought mostly using Managed Money in the futures market. If we look
at diagram 3, we will see it is true. CME - COMEX's trade volumes are
higher than or equal to LBMA's trade volumes. It means that **_the main
buyers' higher demand for gold results in higher gold prices, and
inversely._**

 _Watching Managed Money positions is key to understanding what is going
on in the gold market. These positions reflect a "collective mind" when
every buyer acts based on his/her requirements, but together, they
determine the direction of prices according to demand and supply._

Inexperienced [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s have to deal with unverified or even false
information [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/), while numerous "experts" recommend buying this or
that asset. They often do it deliberately to trap traders.

For example, George Soros spread rumours in 1993 saying that the Chinese
government was buying gold. He urged [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s to take advantage of that
information. When gold reached its 10-year bottom of $326, Soros bought
10% of Newmont Mining Corp's stock, which raised the price to $414. Then
the gold fever calmed down, and gold returned to a level of $361. It
turned out later that Soros had sold gold at the peak, spreading rumours
via the mass media.

These days, we can only dream of those prices, but it was no laughing
matter for [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s at that time. Analyzing big players' positions at
CME-COMEX and capital inflows and outflows in futures contracts, you'll
never be trapped by any "soroses" Have a try and trade [gold][5] at
Forex!

 _Pic.3 Managed Money positions at CME-COMEX_

As we can see in diagram 3, the gold price has been moving
simultaneously with Managed Money long positions opened at CME - COMEX.
To persuade skeptics that it's speculative buying at the futures market
and [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/)s’ buying that influence the gold price in the short and medium
[terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/), I'll provide additional "evidence" based on World Gold Council's
Q3 statistics.

[WGC's report as of 5 November][6] called "Gold Demand Trends Q3 2019"
says that

  * "[ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/)-backed holdings hit a new record of 2,855 t". They grew by 258.2 t up to their highest since Q1 2016.
  * Central banks increased their reserves by 156.2 t, which is a 38% fall y-o-y.
  * Jewelry demand dropped 10% to 460.9 t.
  * Bar and coin demand fell to 150.3 t.
  * Gold supply grew 4% to 1222.3 t.

Despite all those negative factors, the gold price continued growing in
Q3 2019 and reached new multi-year highs. At the same time, the futures
market registered a 3-year peak in Managed Money buying and a new
capital inflow. The speculators' collective mind showed buyers' growing
demand. Open Interest rose to historic highs, meaning that new [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s
came to the market to profit from the price growth. The rest of the
factors, such as the growth in central banks' and jewelry demand,
indicated a slowdown of activity. Even investments in physical gold
dropped, and gold supply rose.

The World Gold Council's data prove that speculators' interest
outweighed all the other factors, and the gold price updated its 6-year
peak. The value of this knowledge is too high. By merely watching
Managed money traders, we can get invaluable information. Analyzing this
information, we can have an idea of what is going on in the gold market.
This insider information can bring significant profits if appropriately
treated.
