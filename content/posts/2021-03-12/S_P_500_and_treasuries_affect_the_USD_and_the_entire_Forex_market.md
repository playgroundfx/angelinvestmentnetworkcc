S&P 500 and treasuries affect the USD and the entire Forex market

## Financial markets' fate depends on how people imagine future

Any asset's beauty and value are in the eye of the beholder.
Technological companies' stock was popular like hot cakes in 2020. In
2021, [Nasdaq Composite][1] was the first US stock index to correct,
falling 10% from February's highs. People imagine the future in
different ways. During the pandemic period, they couldn't go out; they
shopped online and spent a lot of time on social networks. As a result,
Internet shops' and Facebook's stocks were growing. A return to everyday
life can turn everything upside down.

To invest in stocks, one has to be a sci-fi author. IBM, General Motors,
and Kodax used to be leaders 20-25 years ago, but now it's Mark
Zuckerberg's and Elon Musk's brainchildren. Instagram [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/)feed replaced
photo albums. More and more people believe that cars will be flying very
soon and Mars will be finally colonized.

> \- We'd have a new dish.

COVID-19 divided Humanity's life into Before and After. The stock's and
financial markets' fate will depend on who's right: skeptics or
optimists. [Dow Jones][2]'s twelfth record high in 2021 indicates that
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are betting on the banking and energy sectors that will profit
from growing bond yields and high oil prices. Should we dispose of hi-
tech shares then? According to Reuters's latest surveys, most Americans
believe that social distance measures will be in force for at least one
year. That means online shops will make profits, and Facebook will have
the electorate's attention.

US treasuries' value is in the eye of the beholder too. Ten-year bond
yield has grown from 0.9% to 1.6% since the beginning of 2021, making US
treasuries look more attractive outside the US. Foreigners' demand stays
as high as in previous years while the Americans drop them, hoping that
GDP and inflation will rise. The safe-haven assets specialty no longer
appeals to them. Life is too short; start with a dessert!

The US stock market's value is so high in the current circumstances that
central banks' attempt to hold back growing bond yields looks
ridiculous. [S&P 500][3]'s and treasuries' dynamics affect the USD. Can
anyone resist the dollar?

Bulls cheered up on the [EURUSD][4]'s growth following the ECB's
meeting. Fortune appears to be smiling on them after a few unlucky
weeks. Or is it a grin? Get out of the greenback's light. Only the Fed
can weaken it. So, we won’t be waiting for long. Jerome Powell and his
colleagues will discuss the issue on 15-16 March.
