Euro is a Teddy bear. Forecast as of 12.03.2021Dmitri Demidenko

Hardly anybody expected the ECB’s dovish stance to drop the euro. The
EURUSD is driven by the [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) from the US rather than from Europe. Where
will the euro go ahead of the Fed meeting? Let us discuss the Forex
outlook and make up a [EURUSD][1] trading plan.

## Weekly euro fundamental forecast

Christine Lagarde admits that the European bond yield rally resulted
from the expectations of rapid growth in the US economy rather than a
recovery in the eurozone. Therefore, the ECB’s announcement of the
increased volume of the asset purchases under the PEPP will hardly drop
the euro. The [EURUSD][1] follows the US stock market. The new high hit
by the [S&P500][2] amid stabilization of Treasury yields means much more
for the euro than hints from the European Central Bank of a significant
increase in the pace of bond purchases.

The [S&P500][2] has hit a new all-time high amid several positive
factors supporting the US economy. The tech stocks are rallying up, the
number of US jobless claims has been down, the US household assets have
risen to $130.2 trillion, the highest ever, and Joe Biden has signed the
$1.9 trillion fiscal stimulus bill. The Treasury yields stabilized after
the notes auction showed adequate demand for $38 billion in 10-year
Treasuries. The bid-to-cover was 2.38, and foreign [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s bought
about 20% of Treasuries, which is in line with recent [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/). __

The growing demand of foreign [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s for Treasuries may contribute to
the consolidation of the 10-year yield in the range of 1.5-1.6%, which
will be good [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) for the stock market and the[EURUSD][1] bulls. Even
including the currency-hedging costs, holding Treasuries in the
portfolio is more profitable than buying Japanese or German government
bonds.

The ECB’s attempts to press down the euro by saying that the PEPP buying
will be significantly faster look awkward. Bloomberg’s source familiar
with the matter says the Governing Council won’t increase the Pandemic
Emergency Purchase Program. If it evenly distributed its operations, the
ECB balance would expand by € 17 billion per week until the program
expiration in March 2022. The European Central Bank will hardly return
to the same purchase volumes as at the pandemic peak (€ 30 billion), and
smaller figures won’t concern the market. According to Nordea Markets,
the fact that Christine Lagarde did not disclose exactly how much the
ECB is ready to buy means that it will not buy too much.

So, the [EURUSD][1] bulls, as expected, have not been scared by the
Governing Council meeting. The euro has been even up to $1.199 due to
the rally of the US stock indexes and the Treasury yields stabilization.
The market should be sluggish until the FOMC meeting on March 16-17,
wondering if the Fed will express concerns about growing Treasury yields
and how it will change its forecasts.

### Weekly [EURUSD][1] trading plan

The [EURUSD][1] is likely to consolidate. Hold the shorts entered [on
the rise to 1.193][3] and add up to sell trades if the day closes below
1.193. It makes sense to move the stop losses to the breakeven, as the
breakthrough of the local high could push the euro up to $1.2035-$1.204.
