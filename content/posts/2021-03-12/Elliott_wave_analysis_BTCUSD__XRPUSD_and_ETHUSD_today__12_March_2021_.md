Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 12.03.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

At the time of writing, Ethereum and Bitcoin are forming the initial
parts of final sub-waves in the double zigzags. Ripple has started
forming the final impulse in the bullish zigzag.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

The BTCUSD is forming a downtrend, which is unfolding as a double zigzag
[W]-[X]-[Y]. The bearish wave [W] has finished as a double zigzag, and
the upward linking wave [X] has also completed. The market has recently
started developing the final motive wave [Y]. It is yet unclear which
form will take the [Y] in the end. The market should be declining to a
level below 52940 in the near future.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Sell 56583.50, TP 52940.00

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

Ripple is forming a simple bearish zigzag [A]-[B]-[C]. There is forming
the upward corrective wave [B] as a simple zigzag (A)-(B)-(C). The
market could have completed the sideways correction (B) as a double
three, and there is unfolding the initial part of the upward impulse
wave (C). The (C) could drive the price to a level of 0.520, where the
[B] correction will be 50% of the [A] impulse.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] today:

Buy 0.453, TP 0.520

## Elliott wave Ethereum analysis

Ethereum continues forming a double downward zigzag W-X-Y. The linking
upwave X must have finished as a simple zigzag [A]-[B]-[C]. Next, the
market has turned down and started forming the final down wave Y. The
price should be declining to a level below 1660.00, marked by correction
(4). One could enter sell trades in the current situation.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Sell 1795.08, TP 1660.00
