##  **Gold market: peculiarities of pricing and structure**

When trading commodities, it’s important to be aware of their
demand&supply’s structure and dynamics. A typical example is oil, which
is recovering lost positions by leaps and bounds amid expectations of
growing demand and surplus reduction, as main global economies have
started to reopen. Unlike Brent and WTI, gold is less sensitive to the
physical asset market’s state. However, it can punish any time a trader
who ignores fundamental analysis.

Jewellery production and investment prevail in the gold global demand
structure. In 2019, they accounted for 48.5% and 29.2% of demand,
respectively. Central banks’ share in gold purchases was 14.8% while
industrial use accounted for 7.5% of gold consumption. The latter
indicator is important. The thing is it is much higher for silver. The
shutdown of industrial enterprises led therefore to a faster slump of
[XAG/USD][1] if compared with [XAU/USD][2]. As a result, the gold-silver
ratio soared to [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) peaks. Against the backdrop of the recovering
global economy, the ratio may be expected to drop. It means, we’d better
bet on silver’s faster growth against gold.

The relative share of investment in the structure of the gold global
demand grew up to 49.8% while the share of jewellery production dropped
to 30.1%. Consumption of gold reduced almost in all sectors, except for
[ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/)s and coins, as compared with October-December and January-March
2019.

A change in a demand structure is an important pricing factor. When it
happens, we may say a current trend is stable. The shift from jewellery
to investment is a clear sign of bulls’ market dominance.  Jewellery is
too expensive and its consumption is falling. On the contrary, the
faster [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/)s’ reserves grow, the higher their quotes are and the bigger
their buying army is. They sometimes say, gold flows from east to west
in an uptrend. True, in 2019 the relative share of China and India in
the jewellery’s gold consumption structure was 67%, while the main [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/)s
are located in the USA, including the biggest fund SPDR Gold Shares, and
Europe.

The main producers of gold are China (404.1 t), Australia (314.9 t),
Russia (297.3 t), USA (221.7 t) and other countries. Supply’s influence
on the price is limited. The year 2013 is a bright example. Many said
then XAU/USD quotes couldn’t drop below $1,300-1,350 per ounce as it was
gold producing companies’ break-even.  They said production would be cut
to provoke a deficit and a price growth. But in fact, existing hedging
technologies allowed companies to fix the price and continue producing
the same volumes of gold. So, gold fell even below the expected levels
and buyers were punished for their extreme self-confidence.

At the same time, supply shouldn’t be fully ignored. In 2020, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s
felt a critical shortage of the physical asset when trading forwards
amidst the pandemic and shutdowns. As a result, gold premiums grew in
the USA and Europe and [XAU/USD][2] quotes rose as well.

So, investment demand is an important factor in gold pricing. Its volume
is mostly affected by central banks’ monetary policies. Massive monetary
expansion contributes to weakening major currencies, dropping bond yield
and raising [XAU/USD][2] quotes.
