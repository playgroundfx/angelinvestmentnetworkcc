Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 18.08.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

The gold short-term uptrend continues.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

The oil price is being corrected in the intraday uptrend. The
Intermediary Zone 68.51 - 68.24 serves as the target of the trend. In
this regard, at the moment it is profitable to look for purchases in the
zone of 66.89 - 66.07.

If the indicated above support zone is broken out downside, the intraday
trend will reverse down. In this case, switch to sales with the target
in the zone of 64.85 - 64.57.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

  1. Open buy positions according to the pattern in 66.89 - 66.07. TakeProfit: Intermediary Zone 68.51 - 68.24. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. Sell when the Additional Zone 66.21 - 66.07 is broken out. TakeProfit: 64.85 - 64.57. StopLoss: beyond the next local high.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

The gold short-term uptrend continues. Yesterday, traders tested strong
support Additional Zone 1784 - 1783. The zone was held. Now the price is
approaching the main target for purchases, which is level 1794. The
second target is the Gold Zone 2 1800 - 1798.

To enter gold sales, bears need to break out the Additional Zone and
consolidate the price below. In this case, it will be possible to enter
a short trade with the target in the Intermediary Zone 1773 - 1770.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

Hold purchases in Additional Zone 1784 - 1783. TakeProfit: 1794.8.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

The euro's August 11 low was updated. The Intermediary Zone 1.1802 -
1.1793 yielded profits despite the technical analysis.

For today the short-term euro downtrend continues. If sellers manage to
break out the Target Zone 1.1732 - 1.1715, then the next target will be
the Gold Zone 1.1644 - 1.1635. If the Target zone is held, then a
correction with the first target in ​​the Additional Zone 1.1750 -
1.1746 will occur.

It is relevant to wait for a price correction at strong resistances, and
to search for sales according to the patterns in the beforementioned
resistance zone. As a target, it is possible to use the support level of
1.1709.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

  1. Sell according to the pattern in Additional Zone 1.1750 - 1.1746. TakeProfit: 1.1709. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.
