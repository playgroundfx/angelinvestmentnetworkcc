Dollar doesn’t see a problem. Forecast as of 18.08.2021Dmitri Demidenko

Americans are scared by the Delta, and business activity is slowing
down. However, there should not be any downturn in the US GDP growth.
Furthermore, the increase in inflation could force the Fed to act
aggressively, pressing down the [EURUSD][1]. Let us discuss the Forex
outlook and make up a trading plan?

## Weekly US dollar fundamental forecast

The simplest explanation for why the big players move the financial
markets is that they know what everyone else does not know. They do not
look where the crowd is looking. While most [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s were concerned
about a 1.1% drop in retail sales in July and the associated drop in US
stock indices, professionals were selling [EURUSD][1] estimating the
rents. US home rental prices jumped 7.5% in June, showing no sign of
downturn amid a hot housing market and construction lags.

Most [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s believed the Fed's mantra that high inflation is
temporary. However, further increases in CPI and PCE could seriously
change the balance of power in the debt and foreign exchange markets.
There is nothing more permanent than temporary. The share of rental
prices in core inflation is about 30%, and its fastest surge in May in
percentage [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) since at least 2005, followed by the further growth in
June, says a lot.

Yes, the factors associated with supply, which previously pushed the
personal consumption expenditure index up, are likely to be temporary.
But they will be replaced by new growth drivers - rental prices and
wages. Inflation will turn into a long-term problem, forcing the Fed to
aggressively cut QE and raise rates. If so, the US dollar will continue
strengthening.

Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren says the current recovery from the
recession is different from the previous one. During the previous
crisis, the Fed stimulated the suppressed demand with the help of the
quantitative easing program. Now the demand is all right. Moreover, by
continuing to buy assets, the central bank stimulates it even more,
contributing to the rise in prices. The QE should be scaled back as soon
as possible and completed by the middle of 2022.

In my opinion, Rosengren is right. When supply shortage and labor
deficits create problems, quantitative easing is an unaffordable luxury.
As for the decline in retail sales in July, this is nothing more than a
pullback after the previous surge. Yes, retail sales could go down even
lower in August as the number of COVID-19 infections is rising, and
Americans are scared. But there are no signals of the economic downturn.
According to Morgan Stanley, due to the slowdown in consumer spending,
the growth rate of US GDP in the third quarter will slightly decline,
from 6.9% to 6.5%.

The strength of the US economy is evident from the fastest manufacturing
production expansion in July over the past four months.

### Weekly [EURUSD][1] trading plan

There is stable high inflation, aggressive Fed, and growing volatility
in the US stock market. What could be better for a greenback? The return
of [EURUSD][1] to the April lows is just the beginning. The pair should
continue falling after the strong US jobs report and the FOMC meeting.
Until then, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are focused on the minutes of the Fed’s July
meeting. A hawkish tone of the Fed’s members will send the euro-dollar
down towards the second of the three [previously indicated][2] targets
at 1.166.
