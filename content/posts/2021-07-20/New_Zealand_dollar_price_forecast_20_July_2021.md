Kiwi is falling. Forecast as of 20.07.2021Dmitri Demidenko

If fears about the fate of the global economy force [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s to
transfer capital from high-yielding assets to low-yielding ones, then
expectations of a rate hike fade into the background. Let us discuss the
Forex outlook and make up a trading plan for [NZDUSD][1], [NZDJPY][2],
and [EURNZD][3]

## Monthly New Zealand dollar fundamental forecast

Which is stronger, monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) or global risk appetite? Which driver
of Forex exchange rate formation is more significant? To answer this
question, just look at the NZD. Although New Zealand is likely to be the
first among the G10 currencies to raise rates, the NZD loses to the
euro, yen and greenback amid a correction in US stock indices. Investors
are seriously worried that the peak of global economic growth has
already passed, and the Fed will soon want to take away the punch bowl
just as the party gets going.

In the second decade of July, there was plenty of positive [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) for the
Kiwi. For example, the decision of RBNZ to suspend NZ$100 billion QE was
perceived by the markets as a signal to increase the cash rate already
in 2021, while the release of strong inflation data increased the
likelihood of two acts of monetary restriction in August and November.
Indeed, thanks to an effective fight against COVID-19, New Zealand's
economy expanded by 1.6% QoQ in the first quarter. Inflation, in turn,
jumped to 3.3% in the second, exceeding not only the forecasts of
Bloomberg experts, but also the upper limit of the 1-3% range targeted
by the central bank.

The heated real estate market, the recovery of the labor market and
rapidly growing inflation increase the risks of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
tightening. According to experts interviewed by Bloomberg, the cash rate
can grow to 2% by the beginning of 2023, but in the coming months it
will not exceed 1.25%. If the rate basis is extremely low, as in the
current conditions, even a slight increase can lead to serious
consequences. So Adrian Orr and his colleagues will move very slowly to
assess the impact of monetary restriction.

As for the upper limit of the cash rate, according to the RBNZ's May
statement, the neutral rate, which will not stop the economy and at the
same time remove monetary stimulus, is 1.9%. This is significantly lower
than in 2004 (5.4%).

According to the latest FOMC forecasts, the first increase in the
federal funds rate will take place in 2023. By this time, the Reserve
Bank of New Zealand may complete its monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) normalization
cycle, and the rate differential will be 175 bps. Theoretically, its
expansion serves as a signal for the formation of long [NZDUSD][1]
trades, however, the pair continues to fall. The deteriorating global
risk appetite and the associated closing of positions by carry traders
make bears discouraged. In such conditions, funding currencies are
popular, so the decline of the “Kiwi” against the euro and the yen looks
logical.

What's next? If you consider yourself optimistic and believe that the
global economic recovery will continue, buy [NZDJPY][2] if the pair
rises above 76 and 76.7 and sell [EURNZD][3] below 1.702 and 1.6925. If
you expect another recession, sell the NZD against the greenback, euro
and yen.
