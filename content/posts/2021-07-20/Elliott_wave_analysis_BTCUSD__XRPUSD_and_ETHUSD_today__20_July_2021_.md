Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 20.07.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

All three cryptocurrency pairs covered in the article are going to grow
over the next few days. It is relevant to buy.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

The BTCUSD market is forming a long-term corrective wave [B] as a double
zigzag (W)-(X)-(Y). The linking wave (X) must have completed as a triple
zigzag W-X-Y-X-Z. Therefore, the Bitcoin price should be rising in the
final motive wave (Y). The first upside target is at 34700.00, the high
marked by the linking wave X.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 29695.01, TP 34700.00

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

The XRPUSD must have completed the linking down wave X as a triple
zigzag [W]-[X]-[Y]-[X]-[Z]. All motive sub-waves of this triple zigzag
are standard zigzags. Therefore, the market should soon turn up and
start rising in the motive wave Y. The first upside target is at 0.655,
the high marked by the linking wave [X].

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] **** today:

Buy 0.528, TP 0.655

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

The ETHUSD market must have completed the descending wave; the [B]
correction has completed as a triple zigzag. Therefore, the market
should be rising in the impulse wave [C]. The first target is at
2172.00, the high marked by the linking wave (X).

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Buy 1742.68, TP 2172.00
