Dollar checks the rearview mirror. Forecast as of 20.07.2021Dmitri
Demidenko

If the US economic growth boom has been over, why the US stock indexes
are so high? How will the correction affect the [EURUSD][1]? Let us
discuss the Forex outlook and make up a trading plan.

## Weekly US dollar fundamental forecast

The previous peak in the US monthly economic activity occurred in
February 2020. The peak marked the end of the expansion that began in
June 2009 and the beginning of a recession. The expansion lasted 128
months, the longest in the [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) of US business cycles dating back to
1854. The U.S. officially climbed out of a recession in April 2020,
concluding a pandemic-driven economic contraction that lasted two
months, making it the shortest on record. Investors worry that the
current economic expansion will be short-lived, and the peak of economic
growth has remained in the rearview mirror, and the [S&P 500][2] has had
its worst [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) fall in the past two months. The [EURUSD][3] bears have
failed to consolidate the price below the support at 1.177.

### Dynamics of US GDP

Realizing that the [best time](https://www.fixpro.org/post/forex-best-time-to-trade/) has been over and fears about the spread of
the COVID-19 delta variant lead to a flow of capital from more
profitable stocks to less risky bonds. Wall Street Journal experts
suggest that the peak of US GDP growth occurred in the second quarter
when the indicator expanded by 9.1%. If their estimates are correct,
this will be the fastest growth of the gross domestic product since
1983. Economic growth rates will slow down in the future: from 6.9% in
2021 to 3.2% in 2022 and 2.3% in 2023.

It would seem that the lowering global risk appetite should support the
US dollar as a safe-haven asset. In fact, fears of a downturn in the US
and global economies, in addition to the concerns that the Fed may begin
to normalize monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) earlier than financial markets currently
expect, make carry traders close their positions. As a result, risky
assets of emerging markets are being sold off, and [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are willing
to buy funding currencies, mainly the euro and the Japanese yen. This
process is reflected in the drop of the MSCI Emerging Markets Index.

The euro is supported by the Bundesbank confidence that the German GDP
will accelerate in July-September and reach its pre-pandemic level by
the end of the third quarter. Unless, of course, the pandemic in the
form of new strains of COVID-19 does not make its own adjustments. In
addition, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s take into account the report on German producer
prices for June, a further increase in the growth rate of which suggests
a continuation of the rally in consumer prices and more hawkish speeches
by Jens Weidmann and his supporters in the ECB Governing Council.

However, Christine Lagarde's sly hints that she does not expect an easy
compromise with representatives of the German lobby at the meeting on
July 22 may mean that the agreement has already been reached. The head
of the Bundesbank and other hawks have adopted a symmetric 2% inflation
target, and there will be no dispute among the ECB officials at the
upcoming meeting of the Governing Council. This will hardly support the
euro.

### Weekly [EURUSD][3] trading plan

I believe positive economic reports in Germany and the euro area could
only temporarily support the [EURUSD][3] bulls. If the support at 1.177
is broken out, the price will go down towards 1.1715 and 1.1665. The
recommendation is to sell.
