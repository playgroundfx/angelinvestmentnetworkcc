BTC Price Predictions and Analysis: Bitcoin Price Breakout!Jana Kane

Bitcoin breaks a price record again! The coin broke the $58,330.57 mark
on February 21, 2021. How did this advance come about? The rise above
$50,000 really only started in the second half of 2020. It has been a
turbulent year, both inside and outside the Bitcoin scene. Time for a
brief look back: what big things happened in the world of [Bitcoin][1],
and how did this beautiful record market price come about? And what can
we expect from the crypto-king next? Will Bitcoin go up even more? Let's
find out in our Bitcoin coin review!

The article covers the following subjects:

## Bitcoin in Short

We're sure you know, but Bitcoin is the best-known digital currency
(also known as cryptocurrency). It was the very first decentralized
currency that works by means of [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) technology. The native token
was launched in 2009, in the midst of a global financial crisis. Because
many people were suspicious of banks, Bitcoin immediately won the
interest of a large group of people.

The system allows you to send "money" to someone else without the
intervention of a third party. The data is not managed by one person but
by all users of the network. This makes it one large decentralized
database of transactions.

## Bitcoin Price Development and Outlook

First of all, let’s address the price development of [Bitcoin][1]. In
the image below, you can clearly see the various major events and the
price increase. A lot has happened in the past year.

###

### March 13: Bitcoin Crash

The first [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) in the 2020 annual review is immediately the most
negative. It happened on the night of March 12, when the price fell to
$3,850 in no time (Coinmarketcap). However, the panic was not only in
the crypto market. The coronavirus also caused a search for liquidity in
the stock market. The AEX closed that week with the largest drop since
1987, a drop of more than 10%. The crash fits into the list of the 6
biggest descents ever.

With three other falls, the former exchange Mt. Gox was (indirectly)
involved. That same night, the BitMEX derivatives exchange was
temporarily out of reach. It was rumored that a failing stock exchange
liquidation engine was the cause of the deep spike down. A few days
later, the derivatives exchange tried to clear the air by announcing
that it fell prey to two DDoS attacks.

### May 11: Bitcoin Halving

In the past year, something unique happened that had not happened often
before: the halving of the block subsidy. On the 11th of May, there was
finally the [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) that had been long-awaited. For the first time ever, a
miner processed a block with a subsidy of "only" 6.25 BTC. This was a
totally new reward per block and, with that, Bitcoin entered a new era.

The timing was perfect: while the world was on fire and stimulus and
money packages kept the economy going, the opposite happened with
Bitcoin: assets became scarcer.

Since May this year, only 900 new BTC have come into circulation per day
instead of 1800 BTC (as was the case for four years). This supply shock
soon became visible in the price: the supply dried up, and the price
rose.

### June 4: Bitcoin Core Update

The Bitcoin [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) from the beginning of June may not have been
spectacular, but it was not superfluous by any means. Throughout the
year, many developers have worked hard on Bitcoin's code. While this has
not caused very big price increases, it is still hugely important [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/).

Bitcoin Core is the beating heart of everything that happens in the
ecosystem. The 28th upgrade came in June. This upgrade was the result,
which 119 developers worked on for six months.

The major improvement was that OpenSSL was removed from the code. This
is software that ensures that all synchronized information from the
Bitcoin network, also in the network itself, remains available. It’s a
kind of database within a database, simply put. With version 0.20.0,
OpenSSL has been "completely removed," Folkson said. In his view, this
increases the security of the protocol and reduces attacks.

### July 22: BTC Banking

In July, the US Bitcoin industry got a bit more legitimacy. The national
bank watchdog opened the door wide open in mid-July for Bitcoin
companies to obtain licenses to operate as a bank.

The Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) indicated that banks in the US
might be allowed to offer Bitcoin services. The OCC is a government body
that supervises the national banks. They monitor the enforcement of the
laws.

This mainly concerns custody services, i.e., the storage of Bitcoin. In
the second half of the year, the first companies have already jumped on
this [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/): Avanti, Kraken, BitPay, and Paxos have all applied for a
license and bank charter.

Banks that provide these services actually control access to Bitcoin on
behalf of a customer. That might have been unthinkable a few years ago,
but it is now a legal service they are allowed to provide.

### August 6: MicroStrategy

The most bullish [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) of 2020 comes from August. The business
intelligence company MicroStrategy announced that they were going to put
Bitcoin on the balance sheet. The reason? The Inflation Ghost. Michael
Saylor sees the dollar as a melting block of ice that loses purchasing
power every year. During the year, Saylor emerged as a [permabull][2].
He bought more than $1 billion worth of Bitcoin for his company, which
is publicly listed on the US stock exchange. He did this in multiple
batches.

On August 6, MicroStrategy traded $250 million for 21,454 BTC. Around
September 15, the company took it a step further with 16,796 BTC. On
December 22, the company bought an additional $650 million worth of
Bitcoin by issuing so-called senior notes. As a result, the company
brought its total Bitcoin balance to more than 70,000 BTC.

### October 2: BitMEX

In addition to the price hike, perhaps the most shocking [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) of October
was all about the derivatives platform BitMEX. The exchange has been
sued by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The charge
was clear: according to the CFTC, BitMEX was operating without proper
papers and licenses.

Ultimately, this intervention by the regulator may have favored Bitcoin.
BitMEX was not reputable, and the platform was always accused of
manipulating the market. Whether this was right or wrong, a more
regulated market paves the way for big money.

### October 21: PayPal

PayPal opened its doors to Bitcoin in mid-October. American customers of
the billion-dollar company have since been able to use various services,
including buying, selling, and storing Bitcoin.

PayPal does not facilitate withdrawals, however. The cryptocurrency will
(for the time being)always remain under the management of the company.
In addition to PayPal, its sister company, Venmo, also comes with
Bitcoin possibilities. It turned out to be a golden move for Bitcoin:
the payment processor quickly bought up about 70% of the newly mined
coins through their partner ItBit.

In response to the [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/), the price of Bitcoin skyrocketed. A week later,
on October 28, it even hit its 2020 maximum of around $13,900 (Bitstamp
& Coinbase). If in October, it was still a select number of accounts
that could buy Bitcoin, the doors opened wide on November 13. It again
resulted in a price increase.

### Fall 2020: Institutional Money

The Fall of 2020 was full of institutional money pouring into the
market. MicroStrategy kicked it off, but soon others followed. Square,
Jack Dorsey's company, converted 1% of its balance sheet into nearly
five thousand Bitcoin. Stone Ridge later also followed for $115 million.

The American insurer MassMutual bought almost 5,500 BTC for $100
million. Guggenheim Partners also participated. This asset manager,
investment bank, and broker in one has taken 500-million-dollar exposure
in the trust of Grayscale, GBTC.

Ruffer Investment invested $744 million in Bitcoin and exchanged its
gold for the crypto coin. That is about 2.7% of the assets that the
British company manages. It is said to be 45,000 BTC. Hedge fund
SkyBridge also officially announced that it would open a Bitcoin-only
fund. They join a growing list of asset managers who do not want to pass
up the [cryptocurrency price](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/cryptocurrency-price/) action. They also bought up $ 25 million
worth of Bitcoin themselves.

### Bitcoin Above $20,000

By the middle of December 2020, BTC/USD managed to climb above $20,000.
The rise of the Bitcoin cryptocurrency was supported by [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s’
confidence in strong Bitcoin prices. By the end of 2020, Bitcoin was
around $30,000. Why is Bitcoin going up? Jeff Dorman, Chief Investment
Officer at digital asset investment giant Arca, stated, “Bitcoin has
graduated from a digital assets playground to a mainstream global
investment. Investors now have the knowledge and means to buy Bitcoin
themselves, and we are seeing it in real-time, which happened quicker
than we anticipated.”

### Bitcoin Goes Down

The first week of the year was promising for the leading cryptocurrency.
BTC hit a new high above $40,000 on January 8, 2021. Still, the rise
didn’t last for long. On January 11, the digital coin lost around 17%.
BTC touched the low of $30,261 and closed at $35,455.58.

The plunge was partially caused by [regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/) issues. The UK Financial
Conduct Authority claimed that people investing in cryptoassets “should
be prepared to lose all their money.” Regulation issues are always a
reason for market crashes. As a result, Bitcoin lost around $125 billion
in market value within a day. During January 2021, the BTC/USD pair was
mostly falling.

Additional regulatory comments didn’t give [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s optimism.

On Davos panel on January 25, FCA Chief Mr. Bailey was sure that
“Bitcoin's days [were] numbered.” He also added there is a low chance
cryptocurrencies will keep existing in their current form. Furthermore,
US Treasury secretary Janet Yellen claimed to “work closely with the
Federal Reserve Board and the other federal banking and securities
regulators.” Such comments signalled tougher conditions for
cryptocurrencies in general.

### Tesla Boosts BTC

The question of whether Bitcoin would go back up worried [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s. The
decline finished soon. On January 28, Elon Musk added a Bitcoin hashtag
to his Twitter account. As a result, the price skyrocketed by 11% within
a day.

As of February 8, in an SEC filing, Tesla mentioned it purchased $1.5
billion worth of Bitcoin. Additionally, the enterprise claimed to accept
BTC as a payment method. By February 9, the price was over $48,000.

On February 16, the price of the BTC jumped above $50,000. The Tesla
effect was still in play.

Later, on February 21, the cryptocurrency set the all-time high at
$58,330.57 (CoinMarketCap).

### All-Time Highs

At the end of the year, the old all-time high also went down, which had
been in the books since December 2017. On November 25, the "20k" mark
was broken for the first time. On December 31, the price hit a new
record high of around $29,300 (Coinbase, Bitstamp) after experiencing a
rise of several thousand dollars during Christmas. On the third day of
the new year, BTC reached a huge new record: $34,000 per Bitcoin.

During the beginning of the year, the price was hitting new tops. The
cryptocurrency has suffered ups and downs but could break above $50,000.
Bitcoin price today (11.05.2021) is $55 584.78.

## Bitcoin Price Predictions for 2021 by Crypto Experts

Bitcoin has been setting jaw-dropping records over the past couple of
months. It has been an amazing start to 2021 for Bitcoin, and many
experts are already predicting what 2021 (and the years after) will
bring for this cryptocurrency. So far, opinions have been even more
optimistic.

According to a [Finder.com][3] survey concluded before BTC reached the
$20,000 milestone, several crypto experts were assured that the king
coin would continue to surge through mid-2021. Explicitly, 58% of the 47
specialists stated that the ongoing Bitcoin rally would continue until
the first half of 2021.

Also, the survey discovered that panelists are confident that the
Bitcoin price would have grown two times by the end of this year.
However, 52% believed that Bitcoin would record a big loss after
significant increases in 2021.

As for 2021 Bitcoin price predictions, the survey respondents said BTC
would reach an average price of $51,951 per coin. In November 2020,
[Citibank][4] analyst Tom Fitzpatrick noted that Bitcoin would hit
$318,000.

Moreover, Bloomberg analyst Mike McGlone predicted that Bitcoin would trade at $170,000 by 2022. In an interview with Bloomberg Television in 2020, he [said]5.

> “The key thing about Bitcoin this year is very simple - it just added
a one to the front of the number. Remember, it was around $7,000 at the
end of last year. What I’m worried about- if you look at the past
performance, which is potentially indicative of the future, next year or
two could add a zero to the back of the number.”

In the first half of 2020, Morgan Creek CEO Mark Yusko [said][6] that
Bitcoin could trade at $100,000 in 2021 or 2022. In the interview, the
CEO added that BTC could also climb $400 to $500k.

## Bitcoin Technical Analysis

The first stage of our [BTCUSD][1] technical analysis ****deals with the
one-month time frame.

The [BTC/USD][1] price [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) over a few past years is shown in the
chart above. We see a gradual stable bullish trend ****that started in
2017.

Cryptocurrencies' second life started in October 2020 when trading
volumes grew and [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) highs were retested against a backdrop of
the previous years' calm.

[Bitcoin][1]'s price has been growing steeply since then. Thinking this
situation will last forever would be naive. We have to figure out when
the BTC coin will reverse again to buy some [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)s.

### BTC price prediction for the next three months

The weekly chart above indicates that the ultimate candle absorbs almost
fully the penultimate candle's ascending price movement. That's a
bearish signal.

The [BTC/USD][1] price location increases negative sentiment. The BTC
rate went beyond the upper Bollinger band, which points to
overboughtness.

The RSI is overheated too and indicates a bearish divergence.

The limits of a projected fall are marked in the [BTC/USD][1] **** price
chart. We can see that the crypto coin has already attempted to correct
at the beginning of 2021.

Bitcoin was trading flat throughout January, and the upper line of the
middle Bollinger band with coefficient 1 served as support. I don't have
many reasons to say that fractal won't repeat again. Strong support will
then be located at around 42,000.

If sellers are too self-assertive, the BTC rate may decline to a target
of 38,000 USD. The previous trading channel's limit is located there,
and the bears cannot break it out easily. Since the bullish trend isn't
broken, such a pullback may turn to the [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) high's retest.

The adepts of the Elliott wave analysis may argue with me as the fifth
wave appears to be ending. However, the market ****is inert, especially
after a rise that big. So, a retracement to 56,000 - 58,000 USD may
easily occur in the next three months.

### What will be the price of Bitcoin in 2021?

Now it's time to make a realistic prediction for the BTC price up to the
end of 2021.

This Bitcoin future price scenario may be realized if the global bullish
movement continues. If the price drops below 38,000 USD, I will have to
revise this outlook.

Thus, consolidation has seemed to be the likeliest scenario so far. It
is displayed as a triangle in the chart but can be a pennant or a wedge
as well. Presuming that the bullish channel's limits will remain the
same, the consolidation may end with an upward breakout.

The [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) maximum of 58,200 dollars for 1 Bitcoin may then become a
serious obstacle. If that level is broken out, we are very likely to see
sharp ascending momentum, something similar to the [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) peak's
breakout at 20,000 USD. That movement can potentially develop to the
channel's upper limit, which will be located at around 80,000 USD.

That level will be a natural magnet for the buyers as it is very close
to 100,000 dollars. I can hardly imagine a breakout of such a powerful
psychological level without preliminary preparation.

Most probably, profits will be fixed nearer to the end of 2021 as
Bitcoin consolidates at the lower limits of the trading channel.

By projecting [Bollinger Bands](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/bollinger-bands.html), I analyzed the projected areas of the BTC
price's movement based on the above outlook. Check the prediction chart
of BTC/USD above. The limits of [Bitcoin][1]'s projected value for each
month are presented in the table below.

Month| BTCUSD price  
---|---  
Low| High  
March 2021| 38 000| 54 300  
April 2021| 40 000| 56 300  
May 2021| 34 600| 54 880  
June 2021| 38 000| 56 600  
July 2021| 40 700| 72 000  
August 2021| 56 700| 91 600  
September 2021| 52 000| 100 000  
October 2021| 46 000| 85 300  
November 2021| 54 000| 80 100  
December 2021| 59 000| 78 200

## Weekly Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis as of 10.05.2021

The [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) BTCUSD timeframe displays the five-wave bullish impulse (A),
which must have completed. Following the (A) impulse, the price has
started declining, which means there has started a new bear trend. There
must be unfolding the initial part of the impulse down wave. There has
finished the first sub-wave 1, and there is now unfolding the upward
correction 2. Let us see the most recent chart section in the eight-hour
timeframe.

A small wave 1 ended as an impulse. Since late April, the market has
been following a small corrective wave 2, which is likely to be a simple
zigzag [A]-[B]-[C]. The price should soon reach a level of 60470.00,
where correction 2 should end, as it will reach 76.4% Fibonacci of wave
1 there. Next, the price will resume declining towards a level of
47000.00, marked by wave 1 and lower.

## BTC Price Prediction 2022

If the current price is at $55 584.78, what is the Bitcoin future value?

Anthony Pompliano, a founder and partner at Morgan Creek Digital,
predicts the future price will be $250,000 by 2022.

Bloomberg analyst Mike McGlone thinks BTC will be at $170,000 in 2022.

## Long-Term Bitcoin Prediction in 2025-2030

Is Bitcoin expected to rise? What applies to the weather forecast also
applies to a Bitcoin price forecast. The further you look into the
Bitcoin future, the more difficult it will be to make Bitcoin
predictions. In 2025, the world may look very different from what we now
sketch. Nevertheless, we make an attempt. What will 2025 bring for
Bitcoin?

Many analysts agree that Bitcoin does not take the middle ground. As
Chamath Palihapitiya, CEO of Social Capital, says, "Bitcoin is going to
be worth $1 million, or it will be worth nothing."

We do not dare to make an exact prediction of the price of Bitcoin in
2025. The Bitcoin price simply depends on too many factors. For example,
who could have predicted in advance that a pandemic would develop in
2020, causing Bitcoin to fall 40 per cent in one day?

We can, however, look at the long-term price development. And at the
moment, things are still looking good for [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/). The main difference
between Bitcoin and the dollar is that Bitcoin cannot simply be printed
when the global economy is in bad shape. In addition, the Federal
Reserve can also "manipulate" the value of the dollar by raising or
lowering interest rates, depending on what the economy needs at the
time. The result: inflation.

New Bitcoins, on the other hand, are issued at a predetermined rate.
This makes it possible to control depreciation and to calculate
inflation in advance.

Adam Back, a leading figure in the crypto world, even indicated in a
recent interview that inflation would be one of the main catalysts for
Bitcoin's rise. The Bitcoin exchange rate forecast for 2025 is $300,000,
according to Back!

Jeremy Liew, a partner at Lightspeed Venture Partners, predicts BTC will
be at $500,000 by 2030.

Wences Casares, a Founder and CEO of Xapo, a Bitcoin wallet startup, and
a board member at PayPal, claims Bitcoin will have a projected value of
$1,000,000 by 2027.

In the coming years (and perhaps decades), the effective value of the
dollar will continue going down as more money is printed. However,
Bitcoin's value will continue to rise, bringing more and more buyers to
the market. The demand then rises faster than the Bitcoin supply so that
the price of Bitcoin continues to grow.

## Bitcoin Price History

Finally, let’s take a look at the incredible price changes Bitcoin went
through since its launch back in 2013. Analyzing [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) price charts
may come in handy when making price predictions:

## Is Bitcoin a Good Investment?

Should I invest in Bitcoin? Now you may have this question in your mind.
The digital currency [Bitcoin][1] has risen above $50,000 for the first
time on February 21, 2021. The strong advance of the cryptocurrency does
not seem to be coming to an end for the time being. So – Bitcoin: buy or
sell?

Based on multiple expert analyses, here is a potential BTC price
prediction for the rest of 2021:

Back to the present: after reaching the $30,000 milestone, the value of
the digital currency increased further almost immediately. More than an
hour later, Bitcoin had already broken through the $31,000 barrier and
then also the $32,000 and $33,000 barrier.

On Sunday, January 3rd, Bitcoin was above $34,000. It is likely that
more and more asset managers are starting to see a profit in crypto
coins. Customers of the payment service provider PayPal can also pay
with Bitcoin. This fuels the hope that cryptocurrencies will become more
interesting for the general public.

However, the [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s’ optimism didn’t end, and the price reached a new
high above $50,000.

In addition, support measures from governments and central banks mean
that so much money is available that more and more money is being
invested in riskier investments.

Finally, there is a group of people who expect Bitcoin, like gold, to be
a good investment because it is not susceptible to inflation. The
current advance started last year. The digital currency then roughly
quadrupled in value, according to data from [Coinmarketcap](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/coinmarketcap-creator/).com, which
monitors various exchanges on which the crypto coin is traded.

## Bitcoin Price Prediction FAQ

Is it good to buy Bitcoin now?

How high will Bitcoin go? Bitcoin recently hit its all-time high, and
the current Bitcoin price is at $55 584.78. Usually, it’s a better idea
to buy cryptocurrencies when they are in a dip. However, we all remember
how “it was too late” to buy BTC when it was $20, $100, $1000, $20,000,
etc. If forecasts come true, the price may reach $300,000. The Bitcoin
potential is strong for sure.
