Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 10.05.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

Bitcoin and Ethereum should soon start forming descending sub-waves.
Ripple is to continue rising in the final leg of the impulse.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

The most recent section of the BTCUSD price chart displays the upward
corrective wave 2, likely unfolding as a double zigzag [W]-[X]-[Y]. In
the next few hours, this pattern should be completed. Therefore, the
Bitcoin price should soon start declining in the third wave to a level
below the low of 47000.00, marked by impulse 1.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Sell 59247.00, TP 47000.00

* * *

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

The upward impulse wave (1) may not have completed yet. This wave is an
element of the impulse wave [3] of a larger degree. There must have
finished the descending corrective wave 4 as a double zigzag
[W]-[X]-[Y]. Therefore, the Ripple price should be growing in the final
sub-wave 5. Wave 5 should conclude wave (1) at a level of around 1.961.
That is the level where impulse [1] finished.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] today:

Buy 1.600, TP 1.961

* * *

## Elliott wave Ethereum analysis

The ETHUSD market has continued rising, so the bullish impulse C should
finish later than expected. The C impulse could end at a level around
4200.00. Next, the market should turn down and start forming a new
bearish trend. Therefore, after level 4200.00 is reached, the price
should start declining towards the low of 3352.00, and lower.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Sell 4111.19, TP 3352.00
