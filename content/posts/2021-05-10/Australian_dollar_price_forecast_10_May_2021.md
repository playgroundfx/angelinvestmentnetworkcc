Aussie bulls are going ahead. Forecast as of 10.05.2021Dmitri Demidenko

The AUD has many advantages, including iron ore record highs and the
strength of the Australian economy. Moreover, US employment has added
fewer new jobs than expected. Favorable growth conditions for
[AUDUSD][1] prices, isn't it? Let us discuss the Forex outlook and make
up a trading plan.

## Monthly Australian dollar fundamental forecast

No matter how much the Reserve Bank, tensions with China, or Treasury
yields try to slow down the Australian dollar, it will still worth $0.8.
A strong currency is an attribute of a strong economy. This is the
principle of fundamental analysis. A full recovery in Australia's labor
market, export-friendly iron ore price rise to record highs, and massive
fiscal stimulus are making [AUDUSD][1] bulls confident. Moreover, US
employment has added fewer new jobs than expected.

Happiness is when wishes meet opportunities. Australians can easily call
themselves happy. Thanks to the recovery of the sovereign labor market
and a 40% rally of iron ore prices in 2021, windfall revenue is
replenishing the revenue side of the budget. This, on the one hand,
allows the Treasury to expand fiscal stimulus (on May 11, Josh
Frydenberg is expected to report on a new aid package, including
increased spending on infrastructure, employment support, and income tax
incentives for low- and middle-income people). On the other hand, it
improves the state of the budget (it is expected that its deficit will
be only 3/4 of the amount planned in December).

### Dynamics of the Australian budget deficit

At its last meeting, the RBA improved its forecasts for GDP and other
macro indicators. The Reserve Bank of Australia expects the country's
economy to expand by 4.75% in 2021 and 3.5% in 2022, with unemployment
falling to 5% by the end of this year and 4.5% by the end of next.

Along with the positive economic [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/), the [AUDUSD][1] bulls are
supported by the fast-growing iron ore. For some [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s, its rise to
a record level of around $226 per ton may seem strange, because China is
seriously committed to improving the environmental situation in the
country and is going to impose restrictions on steel production.
However, demand is growing including due to potential constraints.
Companies are stocking up, which translates into higher prices and a
43.1% expansion in Chinese imports in April. The latter is evidence of
strong domestic demand, which favorably affects the currencies of
exporting countries, which are closely linked to Beijing by trade
relations. A prime example is the Aussie.

### Dynamics of Chinese foreign trade

Even though the conflict between Australia and China continues, it is
too early to talk about a complete breakdown in relations. Yes, China
has stopped its activities with Australia within the Strategic Economic
Dialogue, but it's worth mentioning that the last time the countries
cooperated within the SED was in September 2017.

### Monthly [AUDUSD][1] trading plan

In my opinion, the strength of the national economy and favorable
external background, including the super-cycle in the commodity market
and the Fed's willingness to adhere to ultra-easy monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), will
contribute to [AUDUSD][1] bulls' bright future. The strategies for
buying the AUDUSD on the corrections with targets at the levels of 0.79
and 0.8, mentioned [in the previous article][2], work and, most likely,
will continue to do so. Why abandon such a strategy?
