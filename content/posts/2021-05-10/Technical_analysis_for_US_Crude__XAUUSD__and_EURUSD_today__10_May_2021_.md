Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 10.05.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

Last week, the short-term euro trend reversed up by breaking out the
Intermediary Zone 1.2083 - 1.2074.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

Last week, the key support of the short-term oil uptrend 64.14 - 63.88
was tested. The traders' reaction to the test of the zone can now be
seen. Target Zone 66.20 - 65.69 which serves as a first buy target has
already been reached. The second and main target is last week's high
66.54.

If level 66.54 is broken out and the price closes higher at the US
session, then the next growth target will be the Gold Zone 68.50 -
68.24.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

Buy according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 64.14 - 63.88.
TakeProfit: Target Zone 66.20 - 65.69, level 66.54. StopLoss: according
to the pattern rules.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

Gold traders are trying to break out the Gold Zone 1833-1831. Price
consolidation higher will lead to the reaching of Target Zone 2
1861-1856 that serves as the next target within the short-term uptrend.

Holding the Gold Zone and breaking out the Additional Zone 1830 - 1829
will lead to a deep price correction down to the trend key support 1818
- 1815.

It is profitable to search for gold purchases according to the patterns
either in the Additional Zone or in the Intermediary Zone with the
target in the Target Zone 2.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today::

  1. Buy according to the pattern in Additional Zone 1830 - 1829. TakeProfit: Target Zone 2 1861 - 1856. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. Buy according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 1818 - 1815. TakeProfit: Target Zone 2 1861 - 1856. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

Last week, the short-term trend reversed up by breaking out the
Intermediary Zone 1.2083 - 1.2074. As a result, the zone of 1.2179 -
1.2162 which serves as a target was immediately reached. For further
growth, it is required to break out the abovementioned zone. In this
case, the target will be the Gold Zone 1.2258 - 1.2250.

If the Target Zone 1.2179 - 1.2162 is held by traders, then a correction
to the Additional Zone 1.2132 - 1.2128 will occur. The correction is a
reason to consider new euro purchases at favorable prices. The target of
these purchases will be the local high.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

  1. Buy according to the pattern in Additional Zone 1.2132 - 1.2128. TakeProfit: 1.2170. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. Buy according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 1.2088 - 1.2080. TakeProfit: 1.2170. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.
