Dollar runs a marathon. Forecast as of 10.05.2021Dmitri Demidenko

The US economic boom, everybody used to be confident in, seems to be
delayed. The US jobs report has disappointed, politicians are looking
for the reasons, the US dollar is falling. The euro bulls are going
ahead. What’s next? Let us discuss the Forex outlook and make up a
[EURUSD][1] trading plan.

## Weekly US dollar fundamental forecast

Recovery is not a sprint, it is a marathon. The US economy has a long
way to go. Some analysts could suggest that Joe Biden's words in
response to the disappointing US jobs report sound like an excuse. In my
opinion, Biden explains why the Fed is in no hurry to discuss unwinding
the monetary stimulus. The US economic recovery could seem booming at
some point, but without the help of the central bank, it risks slowing
down.

In April, US employment increased by 266,000 jobs, well below the
expectations of Bloomberg experts. The previous report was revised down
to +770,000. The report leaves the US roughly 8 million jobs below pre-
pandemic levels. Unemployment ticked up to 6.1% from the previous figure
of 6.1%. Some companies continue to doubt the economic prospects, others
cannot find employees. Problems filling vacancies arise because the
government pays people to keep them from returning to work, Republicans
say. According to BofA Merrill Lynch estimates, those Americans who earn
less than $ 32,000 a year, with existing support programs, have no
reason to go to work at all.

### Dynamics of US employment

According to Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari, a weak US jobs
report explains why the Fed has tied monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) to the pace of
economic recovery. The market reaction proves that [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s have
finally believed that the central bank will continue to remain passive.
Treasury yields fell and the USD had its worst [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) drop in five
months. It has almost returned to the levels of early 2021, and the idea
of its significant weakening, which prevailed at the end of 2020, is
again discussed in Forex.

Citi notes that the US exclusivity is exhausting, and the greenback is
weakening amid the Fed’s passive attitude, moderate risk appetite, and
global economic recovery. UniCredit expects the further decline of the
USD as the global growth is recovering and the risk appetite is
improving. In the week ended on May 2, hedge funds boosted their dollar
shorts against a basket of major currencies to $10 billion, up from $4
billion in mid-April. The current USD shorts are far from $31 billion in
2020. It means the greenback has more room to fall.

However, the [EURUSD][1] bulls still have some problems. Following a
drop after the US weak jobs report, the Treasury yields are recovering.
Investors are now focused on the US inflation data, which, according to
the forecasts, could be at 3.6% in April. If so, will the Fed remain as
cool as it is now?

### Weekly [EURUSD][1] trading plan

I believe, the Fed will hold its [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) unchanged. This is not a sprint,
this is a marathon. The [EURUSD][1] is close to the targets at 1.218 and
1.23, I indicated in [late April][2]. It is still relevant to add up to
the longs on the corrections.
