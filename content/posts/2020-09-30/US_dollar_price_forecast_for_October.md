Forex in October: All come to vote! Forecast for EURUSD, GBPUSD, AUDUSD
and NZDUSD as of 30.09.2020Dmitri Demidenko

Who will win on November 4? Donald Trump or Joe Biden? The answer to
this question will determine the trends for dollar pairs. I will analyze
the Forex trends statistically and offer a trading plan

## Monthly US dollar forecast for October

Every four years, October becomes a really hot month for financial
markets. Whatever drove them in previous periods, be it trade wars,
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), recession, or pandemic, former drivers fade into the
background. Investors are getting focused on the US presidential
election. So, the candidates’ approval ratings have now more impact on
the Forex rates than the US jobs reports or the speeches of the Fed’s
officials. The markets are concerned about the vote, and it is natural.
The result will influence not only the world’s largest economy but also
the global GDP.

According to the statistics, none of the G10 currencies was a great
performer ahead if the election. The euro and the dollar performed a
little better than the others, but there were not any regularities, any
currency could surprise by a rally or a crash.

In 1975-201, the best-performing currencies of October were the AUD, the
NZD, and the euro. The Japanese yen was most commonly an outsider. It
means the risk appetite should grow, and the US stock indexes could
resume the uptrend.

In the twenty-first century, the situation is hardly different. In
200-2019, the Australian dollar, the New Zealand dollar, and the British
pound were the strongest. The Japanese yen and the Swiss franc were most
often among the outsiders.

In the best years, the Australian dollar usually grew versus the US
dollar by 2.3% on average in October. The NZD rose by 2.4% against the
USD, the euro strengthened by 2.1%. The median values of these
currencies in the 1975-2019 period were 0.9%, 0.2%, and 0.7%,
correspondingly.

### Averages and Medians

In my opinion, whoever wins the November 4 election, the lower
uncertainty will encourage [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s to buy risky assets. Donald Trump
promises to further lower taxes and stimulate the economy. Joe Biden’s
victory could weaken the dollar because of the growth of the US twin
deficit and lower risks of the trade war escalation, which is good for
the global economy. As the election date is getting close, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s
should realize that the [S&P 500][1] will resume the uptrend anyway,
supporting the income-generating assets.

### Monthly trading plan for G10 currencies

Purchases of the [AUD/USD][2] and the [NZD/USD][3] on the fall
correspond to recommendations to invest in the currencies of the
countries that cooperate with China. The reason to buy the [EUR/USD][4]
and the [GBPUSD][5] is not only the US presidential election but also
the progress in the EU-UK talks, which revives the hope for a Brexit
deal. In the case of a no-deal Brexit, both the pound and the euro will
be under pressure.
