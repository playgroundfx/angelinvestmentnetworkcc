Dollar goes up amid the troubles. Forecast as of 30.09.2020Dmitri
Demidenko

Carry trades have been an important driver of the [EURUSD][1] fall in
September. It should go on in October. Let us discuss the euro outlook
and make up a [EURUSD][1] trading plan

## Weekly fundamental US dollar forecast

Money rules the world. In summer, big traders were selling off the
dollar. In autumn, they are eagerly buying it again. If we answer the
question “Why?”, we can understand what will be next. The world is going
to change after the pandemic and the US presidential election. The clue
could be given by the assets crashed in September. It is not enough just
to sell the greenback, one should buy something instead. Emerging
markets’ currencies have significantly weakened in September, and the
bet on carry trades hasn’t worked out. Carry traders were closing
positions, going back to the US dollar, which has become one of its
major growth drivers.

In 2015-2019, amid the Fed monetary normalization, the greenback lost
its appeal as a funding currency, giving the way to the euro and the
yen. 2020 should have begun the golden age for carry traders. The
federal funds rate crashed to a zero level, Treasury yield rolled down
to all-time lows, and the rise of the US stock indexes up from the March
lows reassured [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s pressing down the volatility. Furthermore, most
analysts suggested a grim outlook for the dollar, and speculators
increased the USD shorts to a two-year high. The situation was perfect
for carry traders!

Remarkably, this perfect world has crashed because of the Fed. The Fed,
by its vague explanation of the new average inflation targeting [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/),
has triggered the volatility rise, which pressed down the global risk
appetite and supported the greenback strengthening. The situation has
also been fueled by the disputes among the Republicans and the Democrats
about the new fiscal stimulus package. But the responsibility of the
central bank is clear. The US presidential election is another factor,
which increases the FX volatility, discourages carry traders, and drives
the USD index up. The presidential election is going to be the most
important topic for financial markets in October.

Ahead of the debates, the [EURUSD][1] rates were rising amid the
concerns that Joe Biden could beat Donald Trump, which would send the
dollar down. In fact, there wasn’t a constructive talk. The opponents
frequently interrupted each other and even resorted to verbal insults,
which emphasized their disrespect for each other. Based on the approval
ratings, no one won. The major currency pair is unlikely to rally up.
Uncertainty will drive Forex through November 4, and the greenback as a
rule benefits form the uncertainty. Another matter is a new world. The
world after the pandemic and the election. The world of carry trades and
emerging markets’ currencies. After all, it too early to speculate about
this.

### Weekly trading plan for [EURUSD][1]

In the short run, the inability of the [EURUSD][1] bulls to drive the
rates back above 1.18 will signal their weakness, increasing the risk of
the consolidation in the range of 1.161-1.177. Especially since
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s would rather wait and see ahead of the US jobs report. It
makes sense to avoid trading or trade intraday.
