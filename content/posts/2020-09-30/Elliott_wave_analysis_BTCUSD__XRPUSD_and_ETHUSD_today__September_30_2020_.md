Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 30.09.2020Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I suggest entry signals
to trade each cryptocurrency.

Bitcoin has started forming the final impulse wave within a zigzag of a
greater degree currently unfolding. Therefore, the price should be
declining, and one could enter sell trades.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

 ****

The BTCUSD is forming the upward zigzag A-B-C. The impulse wave A has
completed. The price is now declining in the corrective wave B. The B
correction must be unfolding as a double zigzag [W]-[X]-[Y]. The first
two parts of this pattern have completed, and the market is running down
in wave [Y] that is composed of three sub-waves (A)-(B)-(C). After the
bullish corrective wave (B) finished, the bear impulse (C) has been
forming. In the near future, the cryptocurrency pair should continue
declining to a level below 10107, which is the previous low.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Sell 10789.00, TP 10107.00

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

 ****

The Ripple price is forming the descending double zigzag (W)-(X)-(Y).
Wave (W) is a simple bear zigzag. The linking wave (X) is a triple
combination of zigzags. Wave (Y) has just started forming and could
complete as a standard zigzag, like the (W) wave. The impulse wave A and
the corrective wave B have completed. The price should be declining to a
level below the previous low made by the A wave, level 0.218.

Trading plan for **[XRPUSD][2]** today

Sell 0.240, TP 0.218

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

 ****

The ETHUSD is currently forming the down simple zigzag A-B-C, which
started in early September. The bear impulse wave A has finished, and
the bullish correction B has completed as a triple zigzag
[W]-[X]-[Y]-[X]-[Z]. There is now forming the beginning of the new bear
impulse. The first two legs, impulse [1] and a zigzag-shaped correction
[2] have finished. In the next few days, the Ethereum price should be
moving down in the new down wave to a level below the previous low.

Trading plan  **[ETHUSD][3] **today

Sell 355.88, TP 311.21
