JPMorgan Chase: a safe haven in the banking sector? Part 2Mikhail Hypov

##  **JPM: Analysis of most probable price movements in the long, medium
and short term.**

This is the second part of my [JPMorgan Chase][1] review. The first part
can be checked [here][2]. In the first part, I mentioned the list of
systemically important companies. Besides [JPMorgan Chase][1], there’s
another company on that list - Morgan Stanley. This bank was founded in
the times of the Great Depression in the 1930ies. Back then, the US
government banned banks from investment activities to reduce risks in
the banking system. In order to preserve its investment business,
[JPMorgan Chase][1] created the investment bank Morgan Stanley. As a
result, this company is the 67th largest US company by revenue and
[JPMorgan Chase][1] is a direct beneficiary. This fact is important to
consider when estimating [JPMorgan][1] business fundamentally. Also, it
proves its stability during crisis times.

Globally, there’s a 5-wave impulse in the 12-month chart above. Wave 3
exceeds level 1.618 of the first wave’s height, so it can be read as a
long wave. The ultimate candlestick, which reflects the year 2020, has
already shown a 50% correction of the third wave’s height.![LiteForex:

and short term.][4]

We can make 2 conclusions here:

  1. The fall depth points to the development of a corrective wave. The third wave ended in the super cycle.
  2. The fourth wave rarely drops below 50% of the third wave’s length, even more so when the third wave is long. So, the ultimate fall outlined the bottom of the supposed fourth wave which will hardly be updated.

Considering these 2 conclusions, we may suppose there will be a triangle
in the fourth wave.

![LiteForex: J.P.Morgan Chase stock. Detailed technical analysis in the
long, medium and short term.][5]

To estimate the future triangle’s incline angle, I’ve checked vertical
volumes in the supposed area of the fourth wave’s movement on the price
scale. The indicator says the highest accumulation is at 109.73 USD, so
the triangle’s acute angle will be probably directed to that area.
It’s hard to say now for how long the fourth wave will last, but it’s
likely to be much shorter than the second wave, based on the rule of
alternations. Thus, if wave (2) had been forming for 10 years, the
fourth wave will hardly last for more than 5 years. In the very long
term, the fifth wave’s targets may be the third wave’s top, the
[historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) peak at 141 USD and level 0.382 of wave (3) located at around
160 USD.

 **Scenario for the next few years**

The projection of the 2020 candlestick is shown as a grey rectangle in
the chart above. The tolerance zone of 132.78 - 146.02 USD is displayed
as a pink frame. Following the recent collapse, the JPM stock price fell
much lower than the projection limits. It means that the stock is
oversold in 2020. What’s more, the upper limit of the tolerance zone
hasn’t even been tested. So, the price is unlikely to grow above its
lower limit at 132.78 USD in 2020.  That’s why I’ll be guided by this
value when setting long-term targets. Another reference point is the
Pivot point level drawn according to the Fibonacci ratios. The 2020
Pivot is at around 125 USD. This is the likeliest target for bulls
during the crisis, so it can be used for profit fixing too in
conservative trading.

The JPM stock is almost 100% unlikely to grow above the [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) peak
of 141 USD in 2020, so I will open short positions with a stop order at
above 141 USD if the price approaches the above-mentioned levels.

Bears’ key target is at around 91USD. Historically, it’s a level of
trading volume accumulations and key reversal points. The buyer is
likely to protect this area from bears’ pressure. So, wave (C) of the
blue pattern shouldn’t be expected below this value.

 **Medium-term trading plan**

![LiteForex: J.P.Morgan Chase stock. Detailed technical analysis in the
long, medium and short term.][8]

If we believe the fourth wave looks globally as a triangle, its classic
pattern will contain a set of zigzags 3-3-3-3-3. In the example of the
blue wave (A) we see a zigzag with long wave (A) and truncated wave (C).
Most probably, we see the second zigzag forming at the moment. It will
belong to wave (B) of the blue pattern. Because the ultimate impulse was
fast and with a strong correction, it may be identified as an interior
zigzag of wave (A). The impulse of wave (A) of the purple pattern is
long, so wave (C) is likely to be truncated too and won’t exceed 0.618
of wave (A) in the purple pattern.

long, medium and short term.][9]

Thus, the following trade may be conducted before the end of the month:

> Buy at the current levels;

>

> Place a stop below wave B. The month reversal pivot point is located
nearby, so the stop loss can be placed below it to protect you from
false breakouts.

>

> Target for short-term profit fixing is at 115.70 USD, top of wave A.

Profit/risk ratio is 1.8 approximately. It’s not the reference value,
but it may be quite appropriate to some traders based on strong
fundamental data. Make sure you’ve checked this trading plan for
compliance with your risk management system and trading strategy and
remember to preset the trade volume. Don’t even think about investing
your full deposit. You can open a trade in [JPMorgan Chase][1] stock at
LiteForex. If you haven’t started trading yet, it’s time to start right
now: the broker is raffling fabulous prizes to celebrate its [15th

Good luck and profits, everyone!
