Gold is ready to continue rally. Forecast as of 01.06.2021Dmitri
Demidenko

Recently, hedge funds have been getting rid of most of the 23 major
commodities, believing that the time for speculation is over. Gold is an
exception and is ready to continue the rally. Let us discuss the Forex
outlook and make up a gold trading plan

## Fundamental gold forecast for a week

May has been the best month for gold since July last year for a reason.
When inflation rises rapidly and the Fed does not react in any way,
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s can only buy gold [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/) products, and add up to speculative
longs. A weak US dollar, stabilization in Treasury yields and the
decline in the number of [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s contributed to the 7%
[XAUUSD][1] rally in May.

The saying that the older generation considers gold as a protection
against inflation, while for the young people it is a cryptocurrency,
looks beautiful, but in fact, it is just a legend. What kind of hedging
against inflationary risks can we talk about if [BTCUSD][2] prices fall
by 40% from the levels of record highs, mostly due to Elon Musk's
comments? It is not surprising that doubts are growing among [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s,
and they are transferring money to gold [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/)s. The very money, a
significant part of which was received due to the Fed's generosity and
that drives prices in financial markets as a speculative factor.

Curiously, hedge funds have recently been actively cutting net longs on
20 of the 23 major commodities, because prices for them are expected to
be determined not by speculation, but by the ratio of supply and demand.
Gold is among the exceptions. XAU net longs hit a 20-week high.

### Dynamics and structure of commodity prices

In my opinion, the speculative factor, or in other words, the flows of
cheap liquidity from the Fed and other central banks, is of great
importance. Regulators will fully support the global economic recovery.
This is a sign that the commodities super-cycle is not over yet. The
higher commodity prices rise, the more likely inflation will not be
temporary, the more reason to buy [XAUUSD][1].

As for the influence of supply and demand, gold is also ahead of its
main competitors. I have already written about the positive dynamics of
[ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/) stocks. But the fact that China's net gold imports through Hong Kong
in April reached 52.8 tons, the highest since June 2018, also says a
lot. Interest in physical gold is growing, which is a sure sign that
everything will be fine with prices.

### Weekly gold trading plan

Although the precious metal quickly reached the first of the two
[previously][3] set targets at $1905, it will be more difficult to reach
the $1955 mark. [XAUUSD][1] bulls fear that a strong US jobs report will
force the Fed to discuss QE tapering, which will strengthen the
greenback and boost Treasury yields. In this situation, gold may go into
a correction, which should be used to enter longs. On the contrary, a
weak jobs report is a reason for the Fed to remain passive for a very
long time, which will allow gold to continue its rally.
