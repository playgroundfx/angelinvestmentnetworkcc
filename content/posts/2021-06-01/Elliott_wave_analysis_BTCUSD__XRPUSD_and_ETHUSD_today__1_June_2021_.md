Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 01.06.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

Two waves of Bitcoin and Ethereum are unfolding within the bullish
impulses. Expect a continuation of impulse growth.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

##

It is assumed that the BTCUSD market began developing the initial part
of the bear impulse, which will consist of sub-waves [1] - [2] - [3] -
[4] - [5]. The most recent chart section displays the development of a
corrective wave [2]. This correction may take the form of an upward
simple zigzag (A) - (B) - (C). The middle part of this zigzag, that is,
wave (B), seems to have taken the form of a double zigzag W-X-Y. In the
near future, the price may rise within the bullish impulse (C) to the
level of 44500.00, the inner part of which is composed of the sub-waves
1-2-3-4-5. At this level, wave [2] will reach the Fibonacci level of 50%
of wave [1].

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 36750.50, TP 44500.00

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

The XRPUSD market has completed the development of the downward wave
(W). It took the form of a simple A-B-C zigzag. Most likely, there
should be developing the final leg of the zigzag linking wave (X).
Impulse wave A and double zigzag correction B look complete. In the near
future, the market may continue to move upward in impulse C to the level
of 1.300. At this level, wave (X) will reach the Fibonacci level of 50%
of motive wave (W).

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] today:

Buy 1.044, TP 1.300

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

At the ETHUSD market, there could be unfolding the initial part of the
bear impulse, with sub-wave 1 completed inside as an impulse. Quite
likely, a bullish correction [2] is currently unfolding, which is taking
the form of a simple zigzag [A] - [B] - [C]. The market seems to have
completed the double zigzag [B], as well as the first two small parts of
the bullish impulse [C], that is, sub-waves (1) and (2). In the near
future, sub-waves (3) - (4) - (5) are expected to develop to the level
of 3340.00.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Buy 2637.38, TP 3340.00
