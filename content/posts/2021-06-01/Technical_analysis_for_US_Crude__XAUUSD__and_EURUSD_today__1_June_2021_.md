Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 01.06.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

Yesterday, the level of 1909 was reached which serves as the target for
gold purchases at the Intermediary Zone. Today, May 26 high was updated.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

Yesterday, as part of a short-term oil uptrend, the local high was
updated. Now traders are trying to consolidate the price above the
Target Zone 67.34 - 66.81. If successful, the next growth target will be
the Gold Zone 69.73 - 69.46.

Look for new oil purchases at strong supports: Additional Zone 66.30 -
66.16 and Intermediary Zone 64.97 - 64.70. A pattern is required for
purchases. The target will be today's high.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

  1. Buy according to the pattern in Additional Zone 66.30 - 66.16. TakeProfit: 67.58. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. Buy according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 64.97 - 64.70. TakeProfit: 67.58. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

Yesterday, the level of 1909 was reached which serves as the target for
gold purchases at the Intermediary Zone. Today, May 26 high was updated.
Target Zone 2 1903 - 1898 was also broken out. Therefore, the next
target is now Gold Zone 2 1923 - 1921.

Look for new gold purchases on correction at strong supports: the
Additional Zone 1903 - 1902 and the Intermediary Zone 1891 - 1889. The
latter serves as the border of the short-term uptrend.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

  1. Buy according to the pattern in Additional Zone 1903 - 1902. TakeProfit: Gold Zone 2 1923 - 1921. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. Buy according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 1891 - 1889. TakeProfit: Gold Zone 2 1923 - 1921. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

The euro has reached the short-term downtrend's key resistance 1.2229 -
1.2220. The zone is not broken out, so continue to search for sales
according to the pattern. The target for sales will be May 28 low and
lower Target Zone 1.2090 - 1.2072.

The reason for the stop of purchases will be the breakout of level
1.2230 and price consolidation higher at the US session. In this case,
the short-term trend will reverse up, and the target for purchases will
be the upper Target Zone 1.2326 - 1.2308.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

Open sell positions according to the pattern in 1.2229 - 1.2169.
TakeProfit: Target Zone 1.2090 - 1.2072. StopLoss: according to the
pattern rules.
