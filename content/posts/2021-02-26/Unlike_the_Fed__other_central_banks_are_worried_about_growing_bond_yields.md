Central banks take up arms. Review as of 26.02.2021Dmitri Demidenko

Unlike the Fed, other central banks are worried about growing bond
yields

## Regulators shift from threats to action

The market is a battlefield. The battle is between bulls and bears,
China and the US, pandemics and humanity, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s and central banks.
The latter faced the need to counter growing bond yields, and their rise
against financial markets may become the calling card of 2021. Don't
think regulators are saints. They use every means they have, and when
they fail, they have to run.

Less than a year ago, Christine Lagarde said the ECB wasn't responsible
for the bond market spreads and provoked a massive turmoil in the
financial markets. Now Mme Lagarde says the opposite: the European
Central bank is closely watching the evolution of nominal yield on long-
term bonds. That's a significant opinion evolution! The markets took her
so far! When my granny turned 60, she decided to walk 5 kilometers
[daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/). She's 85 now, and I've got no idea where she is.

Other members of the Executive Board support Lagarde's point of view.
Philip Lane, the ECB's key economist, threatens to boost the bank's
bond-buying program if financial conditions grow tougher. The ECB has
spent €1 trillion out of €1.85 trillion under the emergency bond-buying
program so far and can afford to be flexible. Do you think it's just a
threat?

The Reserve Bank of New Zealand promised to extend its QE program, the
Bank of Korea wants to interfere with the bond market, and the
Australian bank has been the most decisive. It bought a record volume of
bonds since the start of QE in March 2020. That didn't work out. The
rates continued growing, and the RBA felt like a fool. The market just
smiled. A smart person has no trouble ignoring fools, but the trouble is
that fools never ignore smart people.

In contrast to other central banks, the Fed pretends not to worry about
the treasury yield rally. Jerome Powell asked Congress why inflation
should show up now if it didn't show up in the last 25 years. After all,
they taught us wrong things at school: a sharp increase in money supply
provoked by fiscal and monetary stimuli won't necessarily boost consumer
prices. The horseman can be headless. The horse can't. However, other
FOMC members appear to support their chairman. The yield growth doesn't
bother them, and they don't think the Fed should take action. Is the
horse all right?

That's what financial markets are trying to find out. Jerome Powell must
be afraid of repeating his forerunners’ 2013 experience, when they
caused a “tapering” hysteria.

While central banks are fighting against the bond market or ignoring its
signals, the [EURUSD][1] quotes continue rising, which looks strange
amidst the Eurozone's weakness and the US' strength. I think it's Joe
Biden's fault. He said America was back and would protect Europe even if
Europe didn't need that.
