XAUUSD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 26.02.21 – 05.03.21Alex
Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 1853.98 with a target of 1718.57 – 1668.45.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
1853.98 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 1960.41
– 2073.73.

 **Analysis:** Daily time frame: presumably, the ascending third wave of
larger degree (3) formed, and a descending correction continues
developing as wave (4). Apparently, wave C of (4) is developing on the
4H time frame, with wave iii of C forming inside. Wave of smaller degree
(v) of iii is developing on the H1 time frame. If the presumption is
correct, the pair will continue falling to 1718.57 – 1668.45. The level
of 1853.98 is critical in this scenario, as the breakout will enable the
pair to continue rising to the levels of 1960.41 – 2073.73.
