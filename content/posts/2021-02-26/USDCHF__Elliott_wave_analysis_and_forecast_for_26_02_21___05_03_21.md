USDCHF: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 26.02.21 – 05.03.21Alex
Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions from corrections above the
level of 0.8992 with a target of 0.9115 – 0.9185.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
0.8992 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of 0.8871
– 0.8760.

 **Analysis:** Presumably, the descending first wave of larger degree
(1) of 5 finished developing on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame, with wave 5 of (1)
formed inside. An ascending correction started developing as wave (2) on
the H4 time frame, with wave A of (2) forming inside. Apparently, the
third wave of smaller degree iii of А and wave iv of A formed, and wave
v of A is developing on the H1 time frame. If this assumption is
correct, the pair will continue to rise to 0.9115 – 0.9185. The level of
0.8992 is critical in this scenario. Its breakout will allow the pair to
continue falling to the levels of 0.8871 – 0.8760.
