EURUSD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 26.02.21 – 05.03.21Alex
Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 1.2345 with a target of 1.1691 – 1.1489.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
1.2345 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 1.2500 –
1.2600.

 **Analysis:** Presumably, the first wave of larger degree 1 of (3)
finished developing on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame, with wave v of 1 formed
inside. Apparently, a downside correction is developing as wave 2 of (3)
on the H4 time frame, with wave a of 2 formed inside. Apparently, wave b
of 2 finished developing on the H1 time frame. If the presumption is
correct, the pair will resume falling in wave c of 2 to the levels of
1.1691 – 1.1489. The level of 1.2345 is critical in this scenario. Its
breakout will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 1.2500
– 1.2600.
