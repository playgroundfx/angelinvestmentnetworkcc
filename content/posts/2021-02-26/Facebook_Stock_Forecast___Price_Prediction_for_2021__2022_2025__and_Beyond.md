Facebook Stock Forecast and Price Prediction: 2021 and BeyondJana Kane

Few people are unfamiliar with the social media platform Facebook by
now. Facebook has almost half of the world's user population active
every month, making it one of the globe’s most influential mediums. The
existence of this social media platform has certainly not been without
controversies, but the [Facebook share value][1] seems to continue to
grow despite these incidents; in 2020, it still enjoyed significant
growth, partly thanks to the coronavirus crisis.

The article covers the following subjects:

Are you interested in buying [Facebook shares][1]? Is it a good
investment? This article takes a closer look at the Facebook equities,
the [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) figures, exciting [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) about the company, expert
opinions, and what we can expect from the FB stock forecast in 2021 and
beyond!

## A Little Facebook History

Facebook Inc. was founded on February 4, 2004, by Mark Zuckerberg,
Dustin Moskovitz, Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum, and Chris Hughes.
Since its inception, Facebook has become one of the most influential
players on the internet. Facebook.com is the [3rd largest [website](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/website-for-forex-trading/)][2] in
the world, according to [website](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/website-for-forex-trading/) comparator Alexa. Only Google and
YouTube are considered slightly more important.

The headquarters of Facebook Inc. is located in Palo Alto, California.
Mark Zuckerberg and more than 25,000 of his employees coordinate all
activities that Facebook Inc. currently holds. And there are plenty of
activities because Facebook now also owns Instagram, WhatsApp, and
Oculus VR.

Facebook's 2018 Q1 results were published on March 17, 2018. Founder and
CEO Mark Zuckerberg commented on the numbers, "We've had a great start
to the year." Sales in the 1st quarter of 2018 were $12.4 billion. A
year earlier, sales in the first quarter were still $9.5 billion.
Another striking aspect of the publication was the increase in the
number of active monthly users. This number increased by 15% to 2.13
billion. The number of [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) users rose 16% to 1.40 billion. Big numbers
if you think about it! The current world population is [around 7.8
billion][3].

The table below shows Facebook's revenue, net profit, price/earnings
ratio, and earnings per share. In 2017, Facebook managed to achieve
sales of approximately $ 40 billion. Revenue has grown considerably
every year, and this has also had a very positive impact on this social
media giant's net profit. If the net profit is compared to the turnover,
we can expect Facebook to run high margins. As a shareholder, you can,
in any case, be sure of a good return.

The price has risen sharply since November 2012. In the years 2013,
2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017, the share's closing price was higher than
the starting price. A great achievement! In November 2012, it was still
possible to purchase Facebook shares for about $20. The price is now
many times higher! On May 18, 2012, Facebook went public. Analysts were
initially very pessimistic about the company's ability to generate
profits. The dot-com bubble was still fresh in our minds, and analysts
also seemed to be right. In the first months after the IPO, the [FB
share price][1] fell below the launch price. Over time, it slowly became
apparent that Facebook could achieve good turnover and profit figures.

The volatility is large enough to take full advantage of these shares as
a day trader. There are, therefore, good opportunities to make a lot of
money with Facebook shares in the short term. The FB forecast is
positive. In the long-run, it is certainly interesting to look at these
stocks. Mark Zuckerberg still has many plans.

## Facebook Stock Price Today



Facebook was also affected by the coronaVIRUS crisis and experienced a
sharp drop in share value due to the 2020 stock market crash. The crash,
which is also referred to as the Coronavirus Crash and the Coronavirus
Correction, was a major and sudden global stock market crash that began
on February 20, 2020, and ended on April 7. Meanwhile, the Facebook
share price has still managed only to recover.

While the Facebook share [was worth only $146.01][4] at its lowest point
on March 16, 2020, later that year, there was a record high in Facebook
share [value of $303.91][4] on August 26, 2020. On Nasdaq, a Facebook
Inc. Stock is traded at a current price of $257.30.

Despite the many controversies over the years and loss of trust due to
privacy scandals, the Facebook share forecast seems to be getting
stronger. However, the price seems to be falling again, partly thanks to
the upcoming lawsuit.

This lawsuit's outcome may play a large part in [Facebook's stock][1]
value for the foreseeable future. Therefore, it is best to keep a close
eye on the [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) about this lawsuit and the surrounding developments as
an interested [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/).

## Facebook Stock Price Predictions: What do Experts Think?

All in all, it shouldn't be surprising that Facebook equities are doing
very well at the moment. Social media is an essential outlet for many
people during the lockdown, and Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp offer
an opportunity to connect with friends and family.

As a result, the Facebook stock value has risen exponentially, and the
price is comfortable, despite the market crash last year. However, the
price seems to be slowing down slightly following the significant
lawsuit that the FTC is filing against Facebook, intending to dissolve
the illegal monopoly that Facebook has, according to the regulator. But
what do the experts say? This recent data was published on January 29,
2021.

### Jefferies & Co.

Jefferies & Co., the American multinational independent investment bank
and financial services company, raised the Facebook price target to
$350.00 from $320.00. The purchase advice of Wednesday, October 21,
2020, is repeated. Their previous advice resulted in a return of 4.11%.

### Morgan Stanley

Multinational investment bank and financial services company Morgan
Stanley raises Facebook's price target to $345.00 from $340.00. The
purchase advice of Wednesday, January 6, 2021, is repeated. Their
previous advice has resulted in a return of 1.19%.

### Keybank

Keybank, the primary subsidiary of KeyCorp, is raising Facebook's price
target to $360.00 from $345.00. The purchase advice of Wednesday,
January 20, 2021, is repeated. Their previous advice has resulted in a
return of 8.27%.

### JMP Securities

Full-service investment banking and asset management firm JMP Securities
raises Facebook's price target to $355.00 from $305.00. The purchase
advice of Monday, August 3, 2020, is repeated. Their previous advice has
resulted in a return of 16.05%.

Therefore, the above-mentioned expert decisions can be seen as an
opportunity to invest in Facebook shares and profit as possible in the
future. Of course, you should keep an eye on the [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) surrounding this
lawsuit because a split from WhatsApp and Instagram will significantly
impact the Facebook share forecast and, therefore, value.

So do your research before you start buying Facebook shares. It may
therefore be an attractive investment for the observant [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) who
closely follows the [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) about Facebook.

## FB Stock Technical Analysis

Facebook tried to rally on strong earnings on January 28, and the bears
were having none of it. The social-media giant jumped to an eight-week
high early, only to close at its lowest price in over a week. In other
words, it had a large bearish outside candle on heavy volume.

The chart below also demonstrates the downward trendline on Facebook,
which has successfully held the stock in check. Also, note how
stochastics recently showed an overbought condition. Lastly, the FB
stock has slipped back below its 50-day simple moving average after a
brief attempt to break out.

Speaking of breaking out (more like the complete opposite), FB hasn't
hit a new 52-week high in 107 sessions. That places Facebook Inc. in the
bottom fifth among its Nasdaq-100 peers. What's wrong with FB? It
appears that positive [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) is known and priced in. In the meantime,
potential legal and business risks are just emerging.

## Long Term Facebook Stock Price Prediction 2025-2030

Facebook's enormous social commerce opportunity is one of the main
reasons to buy and hold FB stock for the long term. The only problem?
Facebook's frantic attempts to tap into its extensive social commerce
opportunity to-date – such as Marketplace – haven't worked. Sure, there
have been minor successes. But they haven't come too close to cracking
the social commerce code.

That all changed on May 19, 2020, when Facebook announced Shops. Shops –
available through both Facebook Shops and Instagram Shops – is
Facebook's best effort yet to tap into the social commerce market.

By the looks of it, it's a winning effort. FB Shops offers the seamless
shopping experience that both sellers and buyers are looking for. It
covers everything from discovery to check-out and should be hugely
popular among small-to-medium-sized merchants and Facebook users.

In other words, it's the first noteworthy step in Facebook creating a
vast online retail marketplace. By the end of the decade, we expect that
this retail Marketplace could generate $70 billion in revenue – about as
much revenue as the digital ad business creates today.

What are the investment implications if you buy FB stock? Social
commerce could push the Facebook stock forecast to nearly $1,000 by the
end of the decade. Please always keep in mind that such long-term
forecasts are very approximate and are given exclusively for
informational purposes.

## Facebook Stock Price: Historical Data

Either way, we can't make any reliable and realistic predictions,
sometimes even short-term, without looking at [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) data (price
[history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/)). Below you can see how the [FB stock][1] price changed over the
years of the company's existence:

## Factors that May Affect the Facebook Stock Price

Of course, Facebook is very often in the [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) and unfortunately often
not in a positive way. For example, the platform is used for spreading
conspiracy theories and selling user data. Below, we've included many
noteworthy [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) items from the recent past. Such events may undoubtedly
affect the Facebook stock price.

### "Russian influence" in the 2016 US election

The 2016 US election caused a lot of controversy in itself, but when it
became known that there would be Russian influence, these claims were
extensively investigated.

For example, it was revealed that Facebook was selling ads to Russian
authorities to influence the 2016 election in Trump's favor. The company
found more than $80,000 in advertising investments from pages and
organizations that violated the platform's rules.

The result of this for trading FB shares was, of course, self-evident:
the value of the asset fell very sharply in 2018 when it became known
that Facebook played a role in the Russian influence, following this
great controversy.

### The FTC sued Facebook

In December 2020, it was [announced][5] that the US regulator FTC
(Federal Trade Commission) would sue Facebook for an illegal monopoly,
which prevents users from protecting their privacy and data well enough.

Prosecutors demand that Facebook Inc., WhatsApp, and Instagram are
divesting so that the company does not have all the data from these
three platforms. Also, the FTC wants Facebook to request permission from
now on before making acquisitions. If this lawsuit is successful, it
will, of course, have significant consequences for [Facebook's
share][1]. However, the expectations are that this will only result in a
large fine for the social media giant.

## Conclusion. Are Facebook Stocks a Good Investment?

Facebook equities are, of course, always in the eye of many [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s.
The current Facebook share price seems to be going very well initially,
but Facebook shares seem to be struggling in the last few weeks.

This most likely has to do with the announced lawsuit and the threat to
separate WhatsApp and Instagram from Facebook. Still, vigilant [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s
who are confident that the case will not cause any significant impact
can benefit. Facebook's share seems to be declining again due to the
negative publicity, making this a good entry point.

Note that Facebook is a company that is often scrutinized due to its
turbulent past. If the company takes more privacy or propaganda missteps
in the future, it could significantly cost the company, which already
happened in 2018.

In contrast, the Facebook price prediction has significantly benefited
from the frequent lockdowns due to the corona crisis, which led to a
sharp increase in Facebook users compared to the previous year.

Also, home shopping businesses are growing exponentially, and e-commerce
is increasingly important. Facebook as a platform can benefit enormously
from this, thanks to the many possibilities to advertise on the platform
against payment.

However, the advice on the Facebook stock future price should always be
taken with a grain of salt. Note that our share of Facebook advice is
just speculation about what may happen in the future. Remember, even the
famous JP Morgan has made investment mistakes. So always do extensive
research yourself before you start investing in assets. This will be
much easier to accomplish by making a free demo account on[
LiteForex][6]. If you think that trading or investing in FB shares is a
good idea, LiteForex is a great platform to educate yourself on the
subject and make rational decisions.
