Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 26.02.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

Bitcoin and Ripple market structures correlate. Both cryptocurrencies
are forming the middle part of the bearish double zigzag.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

The first three sub-waves 1-2-3 have completed in the new upward impulse
wave. There is unfolding the corrective wave 4 as a double zigzag
[W]-[X]-[Y]. There should be developing the upward linking wave [X],
which is also a double zigzag (w)-(x)-(y) of a smaller degree. The sub-
waves (w) and (x) look complete, so the market could be rising in the
final motive wave (y) to a level of 54950.00.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 47059.50, TP 54950.00

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

Over the past month, the XRPUSD market has formed two sub-waves of a
large down zigzag [A]-[B]-[C]. The sub-wave [A] is a bearish impulse,
and the [B] correction is a bullish triple zigzag. Therefore, the market
is now declining in the [C] impulse, which is composed of the sub-waves
(1)-(2)-(3)-(4)-(5). The first four parts of the impulse have completed,
and there should be unfolding the final wave (5) down to a level of
0.333 or lower.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] today:

Sell 0.434, TP 0.333

## Elliott wave Ethereum analysis

Aссording to the structure of the most recent chart section, the ETHUSD
market is forming a new bearish trend, according to the structure of the
most recent chart section. There could be forming the initial part of
the double zigzag [W]-[X]-[Y]. The first sub-wave of this zigzag looks
complete. There is now developing the upward linking wave [X] as a
zigzag (a)-(b)-(c). Over the next few days, the Ethereum price can be
rising in the impulse wave (c) to a level of 1800.00. Next, the market
could turn down and start declining.
