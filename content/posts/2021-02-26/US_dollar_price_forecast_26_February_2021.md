Dollar tested Fed. Forecast as of 26.02.2021Dmitri Demidenko

Traders using fundamental analysis should have been satisfied. Strong
euro-area domestic data resulted in the euro growth; strong US economic
data supported the dollar. However, the market drivers are far more
complex. Let us discuss the Forex outlook and make up a [EURUSD][1]
trading plan.

## Weekly US dollar fundamental forecast

A basic rule to trade in the financial markets suggests [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s should
not go against the Fed. But sometimes people want to play against the
rules, especially since it can yield a significant profit. This is what
George Soros did in the 1990s, betting against the Bank of England and
making his billion dollars on it. History knows many other examples.
Therefore, the best [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) growth in Treasury yields is not surprising;
the market is likely to test the Fed's strength.

The Fed presidents agreed with Jerome Powell’s patience in making any
adjustments to monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). Atlanta’s Fed president, Raphael Bostic,
is not concerned about a rise in yields, suggesting the Fed should not
respond to it. Some other Fed leaders, New York’s John Williams and
Kansas City’s Esther George, believe that the Treasury yield surge
likely reflects growing optimism in the strength of the recovery. The US
bond yields accelerated after jobless claims slumped and durable goods
orders rose at the fastest pace since summer.

The Treasuries sell-offs press down the US stock market. It's one thing
to buy equity securities when rates are low and another thing when the
rates are sharply increasing. The stocks (especially tech stocks) look
overvalued according to the fundamental gauge, and [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s look for
alternatives. The tech-heavy [Nasdaq Composite][2] index dropped by 3%,
which signals a decline in the global risk appetite. That is why the US
dollar strengthened.

Thus, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s seem to be testing the Fed's persistance, carefully
observing how Jerome Powell will behave under pressure. Usually, a rapid
rally in Treasury yields indicates a rapid rise in inflation and forces
the central bank to normalize monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). I would suggest that the
Fed will withstand the pressure. For the first time since 2008, there
has appeared a signal in the bond market known as an inversion of the
break-even curve. The difference between the yields on ordinary
Treasuries and the yields on inflation-protected Treasuries (TIPS) is
more significant for the short-term papers than for the long-term ones.
It signals that the inflation rise will be temporary. That is the
position the Fed sticks to.

Besides, there are more growth drivers for the euro, both global and
domestic. The euro-area economic confidence index has been up to almost
an annual high. Furthermore, the international trader is recovering
faster than after the previous crisis. Therefore, I suggest it is still
relevant to buy the [EURUSD][1].

### Weekly [EURUSD][1] trading plan

The [EURUSD][1] bulls failed to consolidate above the upper border of
the consolidation range of 1.2-1.22, which signals their weakness and
increases the chance of further correction down if the price breaks out
the support at 1.214. Nonetheless, if you are going to enter short-term
sell trades, be careful, set short targets, and be prepared to exit
sales at any moment.
