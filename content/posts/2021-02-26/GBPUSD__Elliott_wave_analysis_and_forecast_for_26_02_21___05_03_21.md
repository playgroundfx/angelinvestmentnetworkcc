GBPUSD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 26.02.21 – 05.03.21Alex
Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions from corrections above the
level of 1.3827 with a target of 1.4300 – 1.4400.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
1.3827 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of 1.3552
– 1.3298.

 **Analysis:** Daily time frame: presumably, the first wave of larger
degree (1) continues developing, with wave 5 of (1) forming inside. On
the H4 time frame, the third wave of smaller degree iii of 5 formed and
a correction finished developing in the form of wave iv of 5.
Apparently, wave v of 5 is developing on the H1 time frame, with wave
(iii) of v formed and wave (iv) of v nearing completion inside. If the
presumption is correct, after correction, the pair will continue to rise
to the levels of 1.4300 – 1.4400. The level of 1.3827 is critical in
this scenario as its breakout will enable the pair to continue declining
to the levels of 1.3552 – 1.3298.
