Three riddles for the dollar. Forecast as of 01.07.2021Dmitri Demidenko

Is the inflation surge temporary? How fast will US employment recover?
These are not all the questions [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s try to answer. Let us discuss
the Forex outlook and make up a [EURUSD][1] trading plan.

## Weekly US dollar fundamental forecast

Buy everything! There is so much money in the financial system that no
one is surprised by the fifth quarter of the [S&P 500][2] rally, which
has added 14% since the beginning of 2021, or the fall in 10-year
Treasury yields in response to rumors about the Fed's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
normalization earlier than anticipated, or the broken correlation
between cyclical stocks and growth stocks. The cyclical stocks, as a
rule, rise if [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are confident in the future growth of the US
GDP; the growth stocks appreciate if there is no such confidence. The
rally of both types of securities suggests that no one knows exactly
what will happen to the economy.

According to the consensus forecast of 52 experts polled by Financial
Times, the US gross domestic product will grow by 6.5% in 2021, but the
range of estimates is so wide that there are doubts about how quickly
the service sector will return to normal, whether the deficit in the
labor market will hold back economic growth, and how will consumption
and saving respond to the reduction in the fiscal stimulus? According to
economists, the likelihood that the federal funds rate will rise by 50
basis points by the end of 2023 is 75%. They believe that the Fed will
be more responsive to accelerating inflation than employment, although I
can't entirely agree with that.

Thus, the market has to solve three riddles. Is the acceleration in
consumer prices really temporary? How quickly will the US return to full
employment? Finally, will the US GDP continue growing by leaps and
bounds, or will it begin to slow down soon? Is it bad for the US dollar?
I guess the greenback will win in both cases. We all remember the
principle “a strong economy - a strong currency” very well. Still, if
the growth of the US gross domestic product loses steam, it will become
an unpleasant surprise for the entire world economy. Moreover, China’s
economy is slowing down, judging by the latest PMI data.

Furthermore, a drop in consumer prices from 2% to 1.9% and core
inflation from 1% to 0.9% in the euro area should temporarily ease the
hawkish sentiment in the ECB's Governing Council. According to
Bloomberg, due to the timing of seasonal sales, CPI growth rates will
decline again in July but then rise in August. Capital Economics
predicts the indicator will accelerate to 2.5% by the end of 2021,
followed by a slowdown to 1% in 2022.

The ECB’s monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) should remain ultra-easy for a long time,
unlike the Fed’s. Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan says it is better
to tighten monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) sooner than later.

### Weekly [EURUSD][3] trading plan

The reason for the Fed’s action could be the US jobs report, ahead of
which the [EURUSD][3] is falling amid the expectations of strong data.
Bears do not care any longer about growing risk appetite, and the euro
has been down to the lowest levels since April. Shorts entered at levels
[1.1915][4] and [1.19][5] look good. The euro is falling to a level of
1.177 indicated [earlier][5], so it is still relevant to sell.
