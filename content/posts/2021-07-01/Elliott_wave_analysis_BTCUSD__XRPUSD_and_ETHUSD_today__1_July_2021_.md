Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 01.07.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

The cryptocurrency pairs ETHUSD, BTCUSD, and XRPUSD could fall down to
previous lows. Let us analyze each pair in detail.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

The BTCUSD market continues falling in the bearish wave (5). This wave
concludes the bearish impulse [A]. Wave (5) is also unfolding as an
impulse. In the twenties of June, corrective wave 4 started developing.
It seems to have completed as a flat [A]-[B]-[C]. The market should go
down in wave 5 to a level of 28750.00, the previous low. One could enter
short trades with the target at 28750.00.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Sell 34906.50, TP 28750.00

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

There continues forming the down zigzag-shaped wave (W), with the final
impulse wave C unfolding inside. The C wave should finish soon. The
price should drop to a level of 0.500 in a small sub-wave 5, which will
conclude the entire impulse C. Level 0.500 is the previous low, where
impulse wave 3 completed. One could enter short trades in the current
situation.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] **** today:

Sell 0.688, TP 0.500

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

There is forming the final part of the bearish impulse wave A, which is
sub-wave [5]. Sub-wave [5] is composed of sub-waves (1)-(2)-(3)-(4)-(5)
of a smaller degree, developing as an impulse. Corrective wave (4) may
have completed as a zigzag W-X-Y. The price could be declining in the
final wave (5) towards the previous low, level 1700.00. One could enter
short trades in the current situation.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Sell 2251.32, TP 1700.00
