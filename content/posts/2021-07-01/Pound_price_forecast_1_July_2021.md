Pound will choose its own enemy. Forecast as of 01.07.2021Dmitri
Demidenko

The return of [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) interest in the US dollar makes [GBPUSD][1]
purchases extremely dangerous, but the pound may rise against other
currencies. Let us discuss the Forex outlook and make up a [GBPUSD][1]
and [GBPCHF][2] trading plan

## Monthly pound fundamental forecast

Successful vaccination, the associated expectations of strong economic
growth and earlier rate hikes by the Bank of England compared to the Fed
had a positive effect on the British pound for most of 2021. Only the
change in the Fed's outlook in June forced the [GBPUSD][1] bulls to
close long positions, which led to the pair's correction. The US dollar
is regaining its credibility. However, the sterling is no worse than the
USD.

Hardly anyone would argue that the UK economy is seriously inferior to
the US one. The labor market is recovering faster than the US, with the
Bank of England forecasting 7.25% GDP growth in 2021 compared to the 7%
GDP expansion expected by the Fed. Inflation in the US is still
accelerating more actively than in the UK. However, BoE chief economist,
Andy Haldane, warns that it could grow to 4% by the end of the year.
This figure is double the target and more than the central bank's
forecast of 3%.

London does not lose to Washington in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of the speed of vaccination
and the inflow of investments. In the UK, 49% of the population has
already received both doses. In the US the figure is 46%. Goldman Sachs
expects capital inflows to [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/)s targeting US securities in 2021 to reach
$500 billion. BofA Merrill Lynch notes that the balance of portfolio
investments in the UK in the first quarter alone amounted to £120
billion. According to the bank, due to successful vaccination and
political risk mitigation after the successful resolution of the Brexit
problem, there is currently a high demand for UK assets from foreign
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s. British [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s, in turn, sell foreign shares and transfer
capital back home. This solves the problem of financing the UK's current
account deficit.

### Dynamics of the UK current account

Yes, the pound has problems from time to time, as in the cases of the
"sausage war" or the postponement of the full opening of the economy,
but the difficulties are temporary. The extension of lockdowns will slow
down GDP in the third quarter but accelerate it in the fourth.

If the greenback has no advantages over sterling, why is [GBPUSD][1]
falling? In my opinion, there are two reasons. First, there are far
fewer hawks in the MPC than in the FOMC. After Andy Haldane leaves his
post, they may not remain at all. At the same time, already five
representatives of the Fed have mentioned 2022 as the year of the first
rate hike. Secondly, the GBPUSD price included the expectations of a
tightening of the Bank of England's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) next year, while the
expectations of the Fed's monetary restriction were not. Their change is
a reason to sell the pound against the US dollar.

### [GBPUSD][1] and [GBPCHF][2] trading plan for a month

In my opinion, the growth of greenback on Forex will continue.
Especially if the US employment data for June are favorable. This
circumstance increases the risks of [GBPUSD][1] falling in the direction
of 1.365 and 1.35. At the same time, sterling can be bought against
currencies, whose issuing central banks intend to adhere to ultra-easy
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) for a long time. [GBPCHF][2] long trades with targets at
1.3 and 1.315 look interesting.
