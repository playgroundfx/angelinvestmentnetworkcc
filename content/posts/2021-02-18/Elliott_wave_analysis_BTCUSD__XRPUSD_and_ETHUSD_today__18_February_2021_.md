Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 18.02.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

Bitcoin and Ethereum could start developing new corrective waves, so the
market might be moving down. Ripple should continue rising.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

 ****

The most recent chart section displays the structure of the upward
impulse wave [3], which must have finished. There has started forming a
bearish corrective wave as a simple zigzag (a)-(b)-(c). There is
unfolding the first element of this zigzag, the impulse wave (a). The
BTCUSD price should be declining in the indicated wave to a level below
the previous low made by the bearish correction 4, level 45800.00.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Sell 52128.50, TP 45800.00

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

 ****

The XRPUSD market is forming the final sub-wave of the global corrective
wave. After the linking wave (X) finished, wave (Y) has started with the
first leg, the W zigzag, forming inside. Zigzag W is composed of the
sub-waves [A]-[B]-[C], where the [B] is a bullish triple zigzag
(w)-(x)-(y)-(xx)-(z). The linking wave (xx) has recently completed, and
the price is now rising in the final sub-wave (z). Therefore, the Ripple
price should be rising in the near future.

### Trading plan for **[XRPUSD][2]** today:

Buy 0.542, TP 0.583

* * *

## Elliott wave Ethereum analysis

 ****

As it is clear from the ETHUSD price chart, after the corrective wave 4
completed as a skewed triangle, the price has started rising in the
bullish impulse 5. There is unfolding wave [iv] of this impulse as a
double three (w)-(x)-(y). Wave (x) is about to finish. Therefore, the
market should be declining in a new bearish correction (y), which will
conclude wave [iv]. An approximate trajectory of the future Ethereum
price movement is outlined in the chart.

### Trading plan for  **[ETHUSD][3] **today:

Sell 1904.73, TP 1652.00
