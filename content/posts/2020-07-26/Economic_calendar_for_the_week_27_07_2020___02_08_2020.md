Economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the week 27.07.2020 – 02.08.2020Jana Kane

##  **Overview of the main events of the Forex economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the
next trading week 27.07.2020 – 02.08.2020**

 **Trading on key Forex [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/): we are expecting the publication of
important macro statistics from the US, Australia, Germany, China, the
Eurozone, as well as the results of the Fed meeting and its decision on
the interest rate.**

The dollar continued to decline last week. The DXY dollar index updated
October 2018 lows by falling below 94.47.

American and European stock indices also closed the week in negative
territory. Investors focused on the worsening coronavirus situation in
the United States, lower demand and continued high unemployment rates
with millions of unemployed Americans. The next increase in the number
of claims for unemployment benefits provoked new fears about the
possibility of a slowdown in the economic recovery due to an increase in
cases of coronavirus infection.

Economists are also looking at data pointing to a downturn in the
mobility of consumers who prefer to stay at home to protect themselves
from the coronavirus. In their opinion, this presents "obvious downside
risks for economic growth and for the labor market."

Against the backdrop of pessimistic sentiments of [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s, gold quotes
climbed last Friday above the mark of 1900.00 dollars per ounce. The
growth in gold prices is facilitated by both the soft [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of world
central banks and the uncertainty about the strength of the upward trend
in stock indices amid the ongoing trade conflict between the United
States and China, as well as the further spread of the coronavirus.

At the same time, the euro, after receiving support from the decision of
the leaders of the European Union to approve a package of expenses for
the recovery of the bloc's economy in the amount of 1.8 trillion euros,
strengthened significantly last week, against the dollar as well.

The regional authorities are providing strong fiscal support to the
European economy, which is likely to have a positive effect on the euro.
The rise in the supply of highly rated euro-denominated government and
intergovernmental bonds will strengthen the euro's international role,
making it an alternative to the dollar as a defensive asset, economists
say.

Next week will not be full of important macro statistics. Investors will
focus on the data on the GDP of the Eurozone and the US for the 2nd
quarter and the Fed meeting, which will end next Wednesday with the
publication of the decision on the interest rate. Investors will also
pay attention to the release of several important macro data for the US,
Australia, Germany, and China.

 _ **Traders should pay attention to the following significant
macroeconomic data expected next week:**_

 *** during the coming week new events may be added to the [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) and
scheduled events may be canceled**

 ****** **GMT time**

###  **Monday, July 27**

###  **12:30 USD Durable goods orders. Capital goods orders (ex defense
and aviation)**

This indicator reflects the value of orders received by manufacturers of
durable goods and capital goods (capital goods are durable commodities
used to produce durable goods and services), involving large
investments. Goods manufactured in the defense and aviation sectors of
the US economy are not included in this indicator. A strong result
strengthens the USD. Previous values ​​of the indicator "orders for
durable goods": +15.7% in May, -18.3% in April, -16.7% (in March), +2.0%
(in February), -0.2% (in January).

Previous values ​​of the indicator "orders for capital goods excluding
defense and aviation": +1.6% in May, -6.6% in April, -1.3% (in March),
-0.6% (in February) , +0.9% (in January).

In theory, the relative growth of the indicator has a positive effect on
the dollar. However, the market's reaction to its negative value may be
negative for the dollar in the short term. Data worse than the previous
value will also have a negative impact on dollar quotes. Forecast for
June: +6.5% (orders for durable goods), +1.5% (orders for capital goods
excluding defense and aviation).

After falling sharply in March and April, these are still weak values
reflecting the still uncertain economic recovery after falling earlier
this year.

###  **Tuesday, July 28**

No important macro statistics planned to be released.

###  **Wednesday, July 29**

###  **01:30 AUD RBA core inflation index using the trimmed mean method
(for the 2nd quarter). Consumer Price Index (Q2)**

This indicator is published by the RBA and the Australian Bureau of
Statistics. It reflects the dynamics of retail prices of goods and
services included in the consumer basket. The simple trimmed mean method
takes into account the weighted average kernel, the central 70% of the
index components. Previous index values: +0.5% (+1.8% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/))
in the 1st quarter of 2020, +0.4% (+1.6% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) in the 4th,
3rd and in the 2nd quarters of 2019. According to the forecast, it is
expected that the value of the indicator for the 2nd quarter of 2020
will be +0.1% (+1.4% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)). If the value of the indicator
coincides with the forecast or turns out to be worse than it, it is
likely to negatively affect the AUD. The data indicate low inflationary
pressures in the country. The growth of the indicator should have a
positive effect on the AUD in the short term.

The Consumer Price Inflation Index (CPI) published by the RBA and the
Australian Bureau of Statistics measures the dynamics of retail prices
for goods and services in Australia. CPI is the most significant
indicator of inflation and changes in consumer preferences. A high
reading is positive for the AUD, while a low reading is negative.
Previous values ​​of the indicator: +0.3% (+2.2% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) in the
1st quarter of 2020, +0.7% (+1.8% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) in the 4th quarter,
+0.5% (+1.7% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) in Q3 2019. According to the forecast, it
is expected that the value of the indicator for the 2nd quarter of 2020
will be 2.0% (-0.4% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)). The relative decline in the
indicator is likely to negatively affect the AUD in the short term. If
the value of the indicator turns out to be worse than the forecast, it
will even more negatively affect the AUD.

###  **18:00 USD The Fed's decision on the interest rate**

Following two meetings in March, the Fed sharply cut interest rates (to
0.25% from 1.75% in February), and also announced the allocation of $700
billion for the purchase of US government bonds and mortgage-backed
securities. Subsequently, the Fed has repeatedly announced additional
measures to support the US economy and inject cheap liquidity into the
financial system. Usually, with the easing of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), the
national currency becomes cheaper and its quotations go down.

In the last 3 months, the dollar has been declining as [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are
withdrawing funds from defensive assets, buying riskier and more
profitable assets of the stock market, which continues to grow despite
the threat of a second wave of the coronavirus epidemic and the
associated economic slowdown. The role of the dollar as a defensive
asset is also declining.

The rate is widely expected to remain at 0.25% at this meeting. At the
end of May, US Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said that he was
"satisfied with the current situation and the path we (at the Fed) are
now heading." "We are not close to any of our limits," - said Powell,
making it clear that the Fed intends to continue to support the economy.
Other Fed leaders have also repeatedly stated in recent days that they
are in favor of continuing the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of supporting the American
economy.

Nevertheless, during the period when the rate decision is published,
volatility may sharply increase throughout the financial market,
primarily in the US stock market and in dollar quotes, if the rate
decision differs from the forecast.

###  **18:30 USD FOMC Press Conference**

The press conference of the US Federal Open Market Committee lasts about
an hour. In the first part, the ruling is read, followed by a series of
questions and answers that can increase market volatility.

Powell's comments may affect both short-term and long-term USD trading.
A more hawkish stance on the Fed's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) is seen as positive
and strengthening the US dollar, while a more cautious position is seen
as negative for the USD. Any hints by Powell about the possibility of a
change in the current monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) will cause an increase in
volatility in the dollar quotes and on the American stock market.

###  **Thursday, July 30**

###  **06:00 EUR Germany's GDP for the 2nd quarter (preliminary
release)**

GDP is considered the most important indicator of the overall health of
the economy. The growing trend in the GDP indicator is considered
positive for the national currency. The German economy is the locomotive
of the entire European economy. A high value of GDP is considered a
positive factor for the EUR, while a low one is considered negative.

The growth of the European and German economies slowed sharply in 2019,
and in 2020 the European economy has already entered a recession in many
ways. Domestic political risks have been added to the risk of no-deal
Brexit and the coronavirus pandemic.

If the GDP data turns out to be weaker than the forecast, it will put
even more downward pressure on the euro. Better-than-expected data may
strengthen the euro in the short term.

Forecast: German GDP contracted by -9.0% in the second quarter (after
falling by -2.2% in the first quarter).

###  **12:00 EUR Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices  (HICP) in Germany
(preliminary release)**

This index is published by the EU Statistics Office and is calculated on
the basis of a statistical method agreed between all EU countries. It is
an indicator for assessing inflation and is used by the Governing
Council of the ECB to assess the level of price stability. A positive
result strengthens the EUR, a negative one weakens it.

In May, the HICP index (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) increased by +0.5%, in June by
+0.8%. Preliminary forecast for July: +0.6%. The euro is unlikely to
react strongly positively to the publication of this indicator. If the
data turn out to be better than the forecast, then the euro may
strengthen in the short term. The growth of the indicator is a positive
factor for the euro. The data show that inflationary pressures are still
low in Germany. The data is worse than the forecast and the previous
value will negatively affect the euro.

###  **12:30 USD Initial jobless claims in the United States in the last
week. US Annual GDP for Q2 (preliminary estimate)**

The situation on the country's labor market is still tense. Back in
February, the indicator of primary claims for unemployment benefits was
within its average values ​​of 193-252 thousand. However, then the
situation began to deteriorate sharply. During the week of March 22-28,
6.9 million claims were filed, then 6.606 million claims, shocking
observers and market participants. The similar indicator published last
Thursday (for the week of July 12-17) came out with a value of 1.416
million new claims.

Published in early May, the US Department of Labor data showed an
increase in unemployment in the country to the level of 14.7%. In June,
the US unemployment rate was 11.1%. Economists attribute this to the
coronavirus, which has hit the US economy. Many American companies have
announced layoffs, and the authorities have ordered non-vital companies
to close their offices and stores due to the coronavirus epidemic. The
current weekly filing growth rate is well above the previous record high
of 695,000 reached in October 1982. Then the number of initial claims
filed in four weeks was 2.7 million.

This indicator (the number of new claims for unemployment benefits)
reflects the state of the labor market. The rise in value negatively
affects consumption levels and economic growth. Under normal
circumstances, a high score weakens the US dollar and a low score
strengthens it. However, in the current environment (the coronavirus
pandemic and a sharp economic slowdown), the reaction of market
participants to the publication of this report of the US Department of
Labor can be completely unpredictable.

 **Annual US GDP for the 2nd quarter (preliminary estimate).** GDP data
is one of the key indicators (along with data on the labor market and
inflation) for the Fed in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of its monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). Strong result
strengthens US dollar; weak GDP report negatively affects the US dollar.
In the previous 1st quarter, GDP declined by -5.0% after growing by 2.1%
in the 3rd and 4th quarters of 2019. The preliminary forecast for the
1st quarter of 2020 was -4.1%, but actually turned out to be at the
level of -5.0%. The data already takes into account the impact of the
coronavirus on the American economy. However, experts predict an even
stronger slowdown in the 2nd quarter (by -6.2%). The publication of the
data is likely to cause a short-term decline in the dollar. The data
weaker than the forecast may even more negatively affect the dollar
quotes.

###  **Friday, July 31**

###  **01:00 CNY China Federation of Logistics & Purchasing** **(CFLP)
Manufacturing PMI**

This indicator is an important indicator of the state of the Chinese
economy as a whole. A result above 50 is seen as positive and
strengthens the CNY, one below 50 as negative for the yuan. Forecast:
48.6 in July (against 50.9 in June).

A relative decline in the index and 50 readings could negatively impact
the CNY. Data below 50 indicates a slowdown in activity, which
negatively affects the quotes of the national currency.

In the opposite case, and if the indicator grows above the forecast and
the value of 50, the yuan will receive support and is likely to
strengthen.

###  **01:00 CNY China Federation of Logistics & Purchasing** **(CFLP)
Services PMI**

This indicator assesses the state of the service sector in the Chinese
economy. A result above 50 is considered positive and strengthens the
yuan. Forecast: 51.2 in July (against 54.4 in June).

Despite the relative decline, the indicator is still above 50, which is
likely to have a positive impact on the yuan quotes.

###  **06:00** **EUR Retail sales**

Retail sales are the main consumer spending indicator in Germany showing
changes in retail sales. A high result strengthens the euro, and vice
versa, a low result weakens it. Forecast: +11.0% (+ 1.4% in annual
[terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) against +13.9% and +3.8% (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) in May.

###  **09:00 EUR Consumer Price Index. Core Consumer Price Index
(preliminary release). Eurozone GDP for Q2 (preliminary release)**

 **Consumer Price Index (CPI)** is published by Eurostat and measures
the price change of a selected basket of goods and services over a given
period. The index is a key indicator for assessing inflation and
changing purchasing habits. A positive result strengthens the EUR, a
negative one weakens it. In January, the CPI index increased by 1.4% (in
annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)), in February - by +1.2%, in March - by +0.7%, in April -
by +0.3%, in May - by +0.1%, and in June - by +0.3%, which indicates low
inflationary pressure and even a slowdown in inflation. Forecast for
July: +0.4% (annualized). If the data turn out to be worse than the
forecast, the euro may fall sharply in the short term. The data better
than the forecast and / or the previous value may strengthen the euro in
the short-term, despite the low value (the target level of the ECB's
consumer inflation is just below 2.0%).

Core Consumer Price Index (Core CPI) determines the change in prices of
a selected basket of goods and services for a given period and is a key
indicator for assessing inflation and changes in consumer preferences.
Food and energy are excluded from this indicator to provide a more
accurate estimate. A high result strengthens the EUR, while a low result
weakens it. In January, Core CPI increased by 1.1% (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)), in
February - by +1.2%, in March - by +1.0%, in April and May - by +0.9%,
and in June - by +0.8%. If the data for July turn out to be worse than
the previous value or forecast, then this may negatively affect the
euro. If the data turn out to be better than the forecast or the
previous value, the euro is likely to respond with an increase, but only
in the short term. Inflation in the Eurozone remains low, and this is a
negative factor for the euro. Forecast for July: +0.9%.

GDP is considered an indicator of the overall health of the Eurozone
economy. The growing trend in the GDP indicator is considered positive
for the EUR; a low result weakens the EUR.

Recently, macro data from the Eurozone has been indicating a slowdown in
the growth of the European economy. However, the decision made by the EU
leaders last week to provide additional support to the economy (a
package of spending on the economic recovery of the bloc of 1.8 trillion
euros was approved) will help stabilize the economy of the Eurozone,
which as a result of quarantine restrictions, restraint in spending by
companies and consumers, as well as the export, is on the verge of the
deepest economic downturn since World War II.

The euro reacted positively to this decision. Nevertheless, according to
the forecast of economists, the GDP of the Eurozone is expected to
decrease in the 2nd quarter by -4.7% (-4.3% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) after
growth by +0.1% (+1.0% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) in Q4 2019 and a decline of
-3.6% (-3.1% YoY) in Q1 2020.

If the data turns out to be weaker than the forecast, then the euro may
decline. Better-than-expected data may strengthen the euro in the short
term.
