Forex: all bets are off! Review as of 11.06.2021Dmitri Demidenko

Markets believed the Fed, but what if the reality turns out to be
different?

## The Fed isn't lying, it's just not telling the whole truth.

The secret of a good relationship is a bad memory. Investors blindly
believe the Fed, having forgotten the events of the 1970s. At that time,
the Fed was trying very hard to control too high inflation, and it cost
both the economy and the financial markets an arm and a leg. Such levels
of 10-year US Treasury bonds yield, excluding the present CPI (-3.7%)
over the past 70 years have appeared only following the results of 10
months. All of them occurred during the period of the highest inflation
in 1974 and 1980.

All bets are off. Today, a huge number of positions on various financial
instruments are open on the assumption that inflation, according to the
Fed, will be temporary. US stock indices are setting all-time highs,
Treasury yields for no apparent reason are falling down, while the
dollar is weakening before our eyes. Everyone firmly believes that the
Fed will continue to supply massive amounts of cheap liquidity. The
central bank will not leave the debt market, even if the Fed officials
cancel the $120 billion QE program. What if the reality doesn't match
the promises?

> \- Fed, did you lie to us?

>

> \- No, I was just not telling the whole truth!

Why is it generally accepted that the central bank should be
independent? Unlike politicians, the regulator cannot satisfy the
interests of a particular group of people. If the Fed starts to
implement policies aimed at weakening the dollar, then consumers will
suffer, for whom foreign goods will become more expensive. If the
regulator comes to [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) with the strengthening of the greenback, then
exporters of US goods will show discontent. The Fed always needs to find
compromises, so it has to mislead the financial markets, giving them
more new puzzles.

Paradoxically, the one who invents the problems earns more than the one
who solves them. Investors have remembered the phrase “don't resist the
Fed” and began buying stocks and bonds and selling the dollar. At the
same time, the worst weekly decline in Treasury yields makes one think
that European and Japanese accounts participated in purchasing these
securities, since the greenback has fallen in price, and it is now
possible to buy US bonds. Isn't that why the [EURUSD][1] price has
stalled despite falling US debt market rates?

The consolidation of the major currency pair has made some [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s
bored. The bulls are unable to cope with Christine Lagarde, who claims
that the eurozone economic recovery is slower than in the US. The bears
do not find the strength to test the Fed as it was in March. Boring ...

> \- Do you feel bored, mister?

>

> \- Not that much...

In the market, you need to be vigilant. It needs to be constantly
monitored because trends are replaced by consolidations, and new trends
follow narrow trading ranges.
