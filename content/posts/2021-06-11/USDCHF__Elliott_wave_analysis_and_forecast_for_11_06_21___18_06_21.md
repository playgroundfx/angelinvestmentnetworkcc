USDCHF: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 11.06.21 – 18.06.21Alex
Geuta

 **Main scenario:** long positions will be relevant above the level of
0.8761 with a target of 0.9169 – 0.9476 once correction has formed.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
0.8761 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of 0.8600
– 0.8500.

 **Analysis:** Daily time frame: presumably, a descending first wave of
larger degree (1) of 5 was formed, and an ascending correction is now
developing as second wave (2) of 5. H4 time frame: wave A of (2) was
formed, and wave B of (2) is nearing completion. Apparently, the fifth
wave of smaller degree (v) of c of B is nearing completion on the H1
time frame. Upon its completion, if our presumption is correct, the pair
may be expected to rise to the levels of 0.9169 – 0.9476. The level of
0.8761 is critical in this scenario. Its breakout will allow the pair to
continue falling to the levels of 0.8600 – 0.8500.
