Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 11.06.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

Ripple and Ethereum markets began to develop the last sub-waves within
the upward double zigzags.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

After the completion of the downward impulse wave [1], the market began
to move within the corrective wave [2]. This wave is unfolding as a
simple zigzag (A) - (B) - (C). Not so long ago, the horizontal
corrective wave (B) was completed as a contracting triangle. Then the
market continued to rise. There should be unfolding the middle part of
the impulse wave (C). Soon, the completion of 3-4-5 sub-waves is
expected near the level of 44500.00. At this level, wave [2] will be 50%
of wave [1].

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 36658.50, TP 44500.00

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

In the long term, the XRPUSD market is developing a downward double
zigzag (W) - (X) - (Y). Most likely, a linking wave (X) is close to
completion as a W-X-Y double zigzag. Wave Y is currently unfolding as a
double zigzag [W] - [X] - [Y] as well. The last sub-wave [Y] is required
for the completion of the previously indicated figure. It could end near
level 1.153. At this level, wave (X) will be 38.2% of wave (W).

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] today:

Buy 0.866, TP 1.153

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

Most likely, the ETHUSD market is currently developing a corrective wave
2 as a simple zigzag [A] - [B] - [C]. The last sub-wave of this zigzag,
sub-wave [C], is forming as an ending diagonal (1) - (2) - (3) - (4) -
(5). All sub-waves of the ending diagonal are corrective, and the end of
wave (4) is longer than the end of wave (1). The last sub-wave (5) is
likely to be unfolding as a W-X-Y double zigzag. It is possible that
prices will still rise within wave Y to the level of 3027.43, at which
correction 2 will be 50% of wave 1.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Buy 2465.35, TP 3027.43
