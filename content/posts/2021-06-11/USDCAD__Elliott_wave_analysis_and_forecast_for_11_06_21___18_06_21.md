USDCAD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 11.06.21 – 18.06.21Alex
Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider short positions below the level of 1.2540
with a target of 1.1850 – 1.1700 once correction is completed.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
1.2540 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 1.2708 –
1.2873.

 **Analysis:** wave (С) of 4 of larger degree continues developing on
the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame, with the third wave 3 of (C) formed inside. The
fifth wave v of 3 finished forming on the H4 time frame, with wave (v)
of v completed inside. On the H1 time frame, apparently, a local
correction has started developing in the form of the fourth wave 4 of
(C). If the presumption is correct, the pair will continue to fall to
the levels of 1.1850 – 1.1700 after correction. The level of 1.2540 is
critical in this scenario as a breakout will enable the pair to continue
rising to the levels of 1.2708 – 1.2873.
