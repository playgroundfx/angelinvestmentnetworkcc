Isn’t euro too low? Forecast as of 26.08.2021Dmitri Demidenko

Markets do not know if the Fed will become worried about the Delta, but
risk appetite is growing. The [S&P 500][1] is rallying up, and [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s
are selling off Treasuries betting on the economic growth. Where will
the [EURUSD][2] go amid uncertainty? Let us discuss the Forex outlook
and make up a trading plan.

## Weekly euro fundamental forecast

Until mid-August, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s wondered if the Fed was right talking about
the temporary nature of highs inflation. The FOMC doves argued that soon
the rate of price growth would slow down, the hawks insisted on the
long-term nature of the increased PCE values. The rapid spread of the
Delta across the United States created another puzzle. Will the Fed pay
attention to the pandemic?

Which way will Jerome Powell and his colleagues go? The way of the
Reserve Bank of New Zealand, which cancelled the rate hike due to
nationwide isolation? Or will they follow the example of the Bank of
South Korea, which has tightened monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), despite the raging
pandemic in Asia? The Fed will hardly abandon its plan to normalize the
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). Still, on the eve of the Jackson Hole summit, the
market has downgraded the likelihood of a hawkish surprise from the Fed
chairman so much that if it happens, the [EURUSD][2] will sharply drop.

Considering the next wave of the pandemic in the United States, large
banks are beginning to talk about a late start in the process of
tapering the QE. Sachs gives a 45% chance that the Fed will announce
monetary tightening in November. Barclays is talking about the same
month, predicting that the actual reduction in monetary stimulus will
begin in January.

The problem is that no one, including the Fed, knows exactly what the US
economy will look like in a year. Will it be sustainable, which, in
addition to high inflation, will require an aggressive tightening of
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)? Or is it a partial, incomplete, and slow recovery? In
the medium term, following the acceleration of GDP in the second
quarter, the leading indicator from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta
expects a slowdown to 5.7% in the third quarter.

And yet, the markets are rather positive despite the spread of the
Delta. The [S&P 500][1] hits its 51st record high in 2021, and the
10-year Treasury yield is rising on expectations that the Fed will not
tighten monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) too aggressively. This will support economic
growth. Investors are too optimistic, pressing down safe-havens. I would
not be surprised if the revision of the US GDP for April-June upward
from the current 6.5% will push the stock indices even higher, creating
new difficulties for the greenback.

The euro was supported by the ECB officials. Vice President Luis de
Guindos did not rule out that the central bank's GDP forecast could be
raised in September. Chief Economist Philip Lane noted that the euro-
area economy is not too far from the regulator's estimate of 4.6% in
2021. Given that the pandemic in the US is spreading faster than in the
EU, is the euro too low?

Furthermore, Lane noted that the ECB is willing to take action if the
Fed’s monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) normalization affects the euro-area economy. It is
a hint at boosting the euro-area QE if the bond yields increase.
Therefore, I maintain the bearish outlook for the [EURUSD][2] and
recommend selling the pair on the price growth to 1.18-1.1815 or on the
drop below the support 1.1725.
