Yen: where does the money flow? Forecast as of 26.08.2021Dmitri
Demidenko

The weakness of safe-haven currencies amid a pandemic looks like a
paradox. But [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are used to focusing on a bright future, namely
the [USDJPY][1] rally. Let us discuss the Forex outlook and make up a
trading plan

## Monthly Japanese yen fundamental forecast

The incessant rally of US stocks is finally starting to force [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s
to flee from safe-haven assets such as the yen. Japanese [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s,
looking at how the [S&P 500][2] reaches a 51-record high in 2021, can
not afford to stay on the sidelines. The flow of capital from Asia to
North America, sooner or later, was bound to lead to the [USDJPY][1]
growth. The first signs of a recovery of the long-term uptrend begin to
appear at the end of the summer.

Based on factors such as discrepancies in central bank monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
and economic growth, the yen should have given up long ago. Even a
series of disappointing US data releases lowered its third-quarter GDP
forecast to just 5.7%. The Fed is not going to abandon the idea of
​​normalizing monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), and Washington is not going to introduce
lockdowns. Tokyo, on the other hand, is ready to isolate up to 80% of
the population, and BoJ Board member Toyoaki Nakamura said that the
recovery of the Japanese economy is being postponed. Such statements
increase the risks of lowering forecasts by the Bank of Japan and
increase the likelihood that the regulator will continue to adhere to
ultra-easy monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) even at a time when its counterparts from
other countries will raise rates.

For the time being, the [USDJPY][1] bears resisted the fundamentals,
which, in my opinion, was due to the reluctance of Treasury bond yields
to grow. Investors bought Treasuries out of fears that an excessively
rapid normalization of the Fed's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) would lead to a
significant slowdown in US GDP in the future. Today, a completely
different idea has arisen in their minds: the Fed's snail pace will help
to heat the economy to a boiling point. As a result, rates on monetary-
sensitive 5-year bonds rise in relation to the yield curve, which leads
to a price increase of the analyzed pair.

I think that the markets believed that Jerome Powell will not present a
hawkish surprise in Jackson Hole and will not be intimidated by the
Delta. Despite the rise of COVID-19 cases in the United States, the
death rate is far from the levels at the beginning of the year. Most
likely, it's all about the mass vaccination. In such circumstances, it
is unlikely that the Fed chairman will make decisions on monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
dependent on a pandemic.

### Monthly [USDJPY][1] trading plan

Thus, the flow of money from Japan to the United States, from bonds to
stocks, increases the chances that [USDJPY][1] has decided on the
direction of further movement. Growth looks much preferable to decline.
At the same time, a breakout of the resistances at 110.5 and 110.65 may
be a reason to enter long trades in the direction of 111.7 and 113.7.

Will the correction of US stock indices make adjustments to the plans of
the bulls, which is expected by almost two-thirds of more than a hundred
experts polled by Reuters? It is not a fact that there will be the [S&P
500][2] correction. Even in the opposite case, the main thing is that
Treasury yields do not stop growing.
