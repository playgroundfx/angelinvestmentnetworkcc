Canadian dollar is against revolutions. Forecast as of 18.05.2021Dmitri
Demidenko

Favorable conditions for the Canadian economy that were created by the
super-cycle in the commodity markets and the normalization of BoC's
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) are contributing to the [USDCAD][1] decline. Does the
Bank of Canada like it? Let us discuss the Forex outlook and make up a
trading plan

## Quarterly Canadian dollar fundamental forecast

The Fed's intention to allow the US economy to overheat has become a
real revolution in monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). Those central banks that did not
follow the Fed's example are beginning to face the problem of the
growing exchange rate of the national currency. The Bank of Canada is a
typical example. It operates in the old-fashioned way, which has led to
the fastest strengthening of the loonie among the G10 in the last three
months.

Loonie bulls are not confused by the fact that Tiff Macklem, seeking to
discourage [USDCAD][1] bears, claims that the BoC is closely monitoring
the Canadian dollar, as its further strengthening will jeopardize
Macklem's export forecasts. As well as Macklem's statement that the BoC
will not rush to raise rates. The derivatives market gives a 50% chance
that the overnight rate will rise by 25 bps in 2022 and is 100% sure
that it will rise by 75 bps and 125 bps over the next two and three
years, respectively.

Expectations for the continuation of the monetary normalization are so
high that Canadian bond yield is the highest among the G10. This, along
with the favorable conditions for Canada created by the commodity market
super-cycle, contributes to the [USDCAD][1] decline.

The Fed's revolution aside, the BoC clearly has every reason for the
monetary restriction. The labor market lacks just 500,000 jobs to reach
pre-recession levels, manufactured goods' prices are growing at the
fastest pace in 40 years, while the vaccination acceleration (in Canada,
about 18.4 million people, or 49% of the adult population, have received
at least one injection) and large-scale fiscal stimulus both
domestically and in the United States suggest an impending economic
boom. The local CCI hit an all-time high of 64.6, with 45% of Canadians
believing the economy will get stronger in the next six months. This is
the highest figure since 2009.

Politicians, including central bank officials, should be concerned about
all industries, not just the mining-related sectors. Some may accept
higher rates thanks to the super-cycle in the commodity market, while
others may not. In this regard, the BoC's verbal interventions look
logical, but the regulator is unlikely to interfere directly in the
Forex. Tiff Macklem made it clear that he would be worried about the
Loonie's strengthening without fundamental reasons, and there are still
plenty of them.

### Quarterly [USDCAD][1] trading plan

In my opinion, the growth of global demand for oil and other raw
materials will contribute to higher prices and the continuation of BoC's
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) normalization. At the same time, the widening of the gap
between Canadian and US bonds will allow [USDCAD][1] to continue its
decline in the direction of 1.18. Stick to the [previous selling
strategies][2].
