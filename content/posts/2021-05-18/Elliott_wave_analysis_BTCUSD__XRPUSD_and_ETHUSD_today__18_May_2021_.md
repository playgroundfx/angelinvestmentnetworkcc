Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 18.05.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

All three cryptocurrencies covered in the article should be rising in
prices in the near future.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

The most recent BTCUSD chart section displays the beginning of the third
impulse wave. There has completed only the first leg, impulse [1]. Over
the next few days, the price should be rising in the corrective wave [2]
towards a level of 55500.00. At this level, wave [2] will reach the
Fibonacci level of 76.4% of wave [1].

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

The XRPUSD market is forming the long-term correction [B], unfolding as
a contracting triangle. This triangle is composed of five waves
(A)-(B)-(C)-(D)-(E). The first three legs of the triangle must have
completed. There should be unfolding the corrective sub-wave (D) as a
double zigzag W-X-Y, where the W wave is a triple zigzag. Wave (D)
should end at a level of 1.632, where it will be 76.4% of wave (C)
according to Fibonacci retracements.

impulse, followed by a slight price rise. There could be unfolding the
upward correction [2], where the price is likely to be rising to a level
of 3750.00. At this level, wave [2] should reach the Fibonacci ratio of
