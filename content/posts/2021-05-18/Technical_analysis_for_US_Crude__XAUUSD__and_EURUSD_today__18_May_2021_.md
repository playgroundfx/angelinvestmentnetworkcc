Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 18.05.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

The short-term euro trend has reversed up. Yesterday, the Intermediary
Zone 1.2148 - 1.2139 was broken out.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

Yesterday, players broke out level 66.02 without providing a sell
pattern within a short-term downtrend. Traders are testing the
resistance level 66.54. If it is broken out, the trend will reverse up,
and the target for purchases will be the upper Target Zone 68.94 -
68.41.

Otherwise, when the price returns under the resistance level 65.76, look
for an opportunity to sell oil with the first target at level 63.32.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

Yesterday, traders tested the local support Additional Zone 1844 - 1843.
There started an accumulation of buy positions, and the price updated
the local high of the day. The Target Zone 1858 - 1853 was also broken
out. Now, the Gold Zone 1878 - 1876 serves as the target within the
trend.

It is profitable to consider new purchases in the new Additional Zone
1862 - 1861 and the Intermediary Zone (trend borders) 1851 - 1849. To
open a deal, wait for the pattern as confirmation.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

  1. Buy according to the pattern in Additional Zone 1862 - 1861. TakeProfit: 1871, Gold Zone 1878 - 1876. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. Buy according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 1851 - 1849. TakeProfit: 1871, Gold Zone 1878 - 1876. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

The short-term euro trend has reversed up. Yesterday, the Intermediary
Zone 1.2148 - 1.2139 was broken out. Now, the Target Zone 1.2245 -
1.2227 serves as a target.

It is profitable to look for euro purchases on correction at strong
support levels. Additional Zone 1.2142 - 1.2138 and Intermediary Zone
1.2098 - 1.2089 are strong supports today. Take a part of the profits at
the local high of the day, if the market gives such an opportunity.
