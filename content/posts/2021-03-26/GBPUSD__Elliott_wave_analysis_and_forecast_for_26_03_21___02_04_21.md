GBPUSD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 26.03.21 – 02.04.21Alex
Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 1.4007 with a target of 1.3552 – 1.3158.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
1.4007 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 1.4237 –
1.4400.

 **Analysis:** Daily time frame: presumably, the first wave of larger
degree (1) finished developing, with wave 5 of (1) formed inside. A
downward correction started developing as wave (2) on the H4 time frame,
with wave A of (2) forming inside. Apparently, the third wave of smaller
degree iii of A is developing on the H1 time frame. If this assumption
is correct, the pair will continue to fall to 1.3552 – 1.3158. The level
of 1.4007 is critical in this scenario, as the breakout will enable the
pair to continue rising to the levels of 1.4237 – 1.4400.
