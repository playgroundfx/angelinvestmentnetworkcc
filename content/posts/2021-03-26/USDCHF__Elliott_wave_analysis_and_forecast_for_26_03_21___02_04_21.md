USDCHF: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 26.03.21 – 02.04.21Alex
Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions from corrections above the
level of 0.9213 with a target of 0.9508 – 0.9681.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
0.9213 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of 0.9079
– 0.9003.

 **Analysis:** Presumably, the descending first wave of larger degree
(1) of 5 finished developing on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame, with wave 5 of (1)
formed inside. An ascending correction started developing as wave (2) on
the H4 time frame, with wave A of (2) forming inside. Apparently, the
third wave of smaller degree iii of A is forming on the H1 time frame,
with wave (v) of iii forming as part of it. If the presumption is
correct, the pair will continue to rise to the levels of 0.9508 –
0.9681. The level of 0.9213 is critical in this scenario. Its breakout
will allow the pair to continue falling to the levels of 0.9079 –
0.9003.
