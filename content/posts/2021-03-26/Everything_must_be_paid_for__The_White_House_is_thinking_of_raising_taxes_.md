Everything must be paid for. The White House is thinking of raising
taxes.

## The rich are getting richer

War is good for business. Speculators profit from hungry people who are
ready to give away their last shirt to buy some bread while the rich
make profits out of crises. According to the Fed's research, the wealth
of 1% of the US wealthiest families rose by $4 trillion in 2020. That
means that they grabbed 35% of the profits generated in the country. The
poorest part of the population got only 4% of the total profits.
However, wealth and happiness aren't the same things. You can tell
people are happy by looking at their shirts: happy people’s sleeves are
tied together.

Envying wealthy people isn't reasonable: no one knows about their
skeletons in the cupboard and their sacrifice.

> \- Your grandfather's sword is fantastic! It's kinda calling you to
war!

>

> \- Is it? You'd better look at his wooden leg then.

Those people know what "seize the day" really means: things can get much
worse soon, so enjoy the present moment. Joe Biden and his team said for
the first time in mid-March that one would have to pay back the large
fiscal stimuli. The burden will mainly affect the wealthiest Americans.
The White House is planning to raise income taxes to 39.6% for those
earning more than $400,000 a year.

Learn to make friends with your enemy's enemy. Congress is very likely
to approve of the tax hike, which will be the biggest tax increase since
1993, as most Americans support the idea. What's more, 1% of the US
wealthiest families hide nearly 20% of their income from the IRS through
private companies and offshore areas, Bloomberg suggests. Collecting all
unpaid tax would increase revenue to the Treasury by around $175
billion.

The law must apply to everyone, but sometimes it doesn’t. However, those
who will be affected will regret the day they were born:

> \- What are your family's holiday plans for this year?

>

> \- My daughter will be in Switzerland, my son – in Hawaii, my wife –
in Paris. And I will be in prison, most probably.

I should mention that social inequality does not exist only within a
particular country but between different countries, as well. In the
Eurozone, that's the problem of the Rich North and the Poor South. On a
global scale, that's the problem of developed and emerging economies.
Bloomberg's study suggests that the former, including Canada, Great
Britain, Germany, etc., will profit the most from Joe Biden's fiscal
bill. The emerging markets of Brazil, Argentina, Indonesia, etc., will
face problems because the USD rate will consolidate, and the service
costs of dollar-denominated debts will increase. The rich get rich, the
poor get poor.

Since [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s were buying emerging economies' assets so actively at
the end of 2020, their current panic is understandable: the growth in US
bond yields badly affects their portfolios. However, don't panic if you
got lost in a forest. Just look at green moss: green calms people down.
Let's just come to our senses and believe that the second half of 2021
won't be like the first one.
