XAUUSD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 26.03.21 – 02.04.21Alex
Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 1755.42 with a target of 1675.33 – 1620.09.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
1755.42 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 1799.64
– 1875.25.

 **Analysis:** Daily time frame: presumably, the ascending third wave of
larger degree (3) formed, and a descending correction continues
developing as wave (4). Apparently, wave C of (4) is developing on the
4H time frame, with wave iii of C completed inside. A local correction
appears to have developed as wave iv of C on the H1 time frame, and wave
v of C started developing. If the presumption is correct, the pair will
continue falling to 1675.33 – 1620.09. The level of 1755.42 is critical
in this scenario, as the breakout will enable the pair to continue
rising to the levels of 1799.64 – 1875.25.
