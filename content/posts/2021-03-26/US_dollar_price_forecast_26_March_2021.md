Dollar likes riddles. Forecast as of 26.03.2021Dmitri Demidenko

The US exclusivity, increasing demand for the Treasuries, and the talks
about QE tapering by the Fed have sent the [EURUSD][1] to the lowest
level since November. What if the negative has already been priced in
the pair’s rate? Let us discuss the Forex outlook and make up a trading
plan.

## Weekly US dollar fundamental forecast

Hardly had [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s solved the previous Fed’s riddles when the central
bank offered a new one. Jerome Powell said the Fed “will gradually roll
back” the $120 billion monthly bond purchases the Fed currently makes
“when the economy is all but fully recovered.” The question is, what
exactly does the Fed Chair mean by the word “economy”? If he talks about
the US GDP, then the FOMC's optimistic forecast of 6.5% for 2021
suggests that the indicator may return to pre-pandemic levels as early
as the middle of this year. Will the Federal Reserve officials discuss
the QE reduction in April? If they do, the [EURUSD][1] drop in March is
just the beginning.

After all, Powell may not mean the GDP.  Federal Reserve Vice Chair
Richard Clarida said it would take some time for economic activity and
employment to return to levels that prevailed at the business cycle peak
reached last February. Employment is still far from the pre-crisis
levels, and the FOMC forecast for unemployment suggests that its level
at the end of 2021 will be higher than before the crisis. Will the Fed
continue to buy Treasury and mortgage bonds in the same volume at least
until the end of this year? If so, the [EURUSD][1] bulls could go ahead,
provided there is good [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) from Europe.

Anyway, [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) shows [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s have been more aggressive on tightening
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) than the Fed since 2008. After the previous recession,
the market expected the federal funds rate to rise two years after the
crisis ended. In fact, the central bank raised it only in late 2015.

US dollar now has several advantages. They include successful
vaccination (Joe Biden promised to inoculate 200 million Americans by
the time of the expiration of the first 100 days of his term in office,
which is twice as much as previously expected), growing demand of
foreign [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s for Treasuries, and, most importantly, the US
exclusivity. According to Bloomberg research, the advanced economies
will mostly benefit from the US fiscal stimulus. On the other hand,
emerging markets can face a strong economic downturn resulting from the
greenback strengthening. Uneven economic growth plays into the hands of
the [EURUSD][1] bears.

How can Europe respond? Appeals from Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi
to the EU on the need to accelerate vaccination? Or a statement by ECB
Vice-President Luis de Guindos that if the number of injections in
Europe rises sharply by summer, the euro area will experience an
economic boom in the second half of 2021? I would like to believe, but
it seems that the [EURUSD][1] bulls need something more convincing than
the officials' words.

### Weekly [EURUSD][1] trading plan

The euro has reached the downside targets at $1.18 and $1.176 indicated
in the [previous articles][2]. Will the bears drive the price deeper? It
won’t be relevant to buy the [EURUSD][1] until the pair goes up above
1.192. Meanwhile, I prefer to take a part of profits from the shorts
entered at levels [1.199][3] and [1.193][2].
