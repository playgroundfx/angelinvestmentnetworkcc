Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 26.03.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

Over the next few days, the XRPUSD and ETHUSD cryptocurrency pairs
should be developing upward zigzags.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

The market must have completed the corrective down wave 4 as a simple
zigzag [a]-[b]-[c]. The market is rising, forming the initial part of
wave 5. Wave 5 should be developing as a simple five-impulse. Over the
next few days, the price should be rising to the level above the
previous high made by correction (4), which is above 57260.00.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 52376.50, TP 57260.00

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

The XRPUSD continues forming the upward wave (C), which may conclude the
entire wave [Y] of a larger degree. The (C) wave us unfolding as an
ending diagonal 1-2-3-4-5. According to the chart structure, this ending
diagonal has completed four legs out of five. The final wave 5 has
recently started unfolding. In the next few days, there should be
developing a bullish zigzag [a]-[b]-[c]. The first impulse [a] should
end at a level of 0.567. An approximate trajectory of the Ripple future
price movement is presented in the chart.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] today:

Buy 0.530, TP 0.567

## Elliott wave Ethereum analysis

The hourly ETHUSD chart displays the upward wave (5), which is unfolding
as an ending diagonal 1-2-3-4-5. The first zigzag-shaped sub-waves of
the diagonal must have finished. There is developing the upward impulse
wave [a] within wave 5. Wave 5, like the preceding for ones, should be a
simple zigzag [a]-[b]-[c], as outlined in the chart. Impulse [a] could
end at a level around 1870.00, where correction [b] of wave 4 finished.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Buy 1612.45, TP 1870.00
