USDJPY: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 26.03.21 – 02.04.21Alex
Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions from corrections above the
level of 108.37 with a target of 111.72 – 114.00.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
108.37 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of 107.10
– 106.58.

 **Analysis:** Daily TM: apparently, a descending correction of larger
degree finished forming as wave B, and wave С started developing, with
the first wave (1) of С forming inside.

On the H4 time frame, the third wave of smaller degree 3 of (1) is
developing, with wave iii of 3 forming inside. Apparently, the wave (i)
of iii has formed and correction (ii) of iii is completed on the H1 time
frame. If the presumption is correct, the pair will continue to rise to
the levels of 111.72 – 114.00 in wave (iii) of iii. The level of 108.37
is critical in this scenario as the breakout will enable the pair to
continue declining to the levels of 107.10 – 106.58.
