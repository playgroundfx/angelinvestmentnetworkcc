Analysis for oil, gold, and EUR/USD for 11.06.2020Alex Rodiоnov

###  **USCrude – oil**

Oil middle-term uptrend is slowing down. The price is now trading under
the resistance Target Zone 5 [41.67 – 40.92]. The trend key support is
in the zone of [31.01 – 30.11].

To sell oil in the correction, we need a corresponding pattern, which
hasn’t yet formed. To enter buy trades, we need a test of the trend key
support.

The short-term trend is up. Sellers are trying to break out Additional
Zone [37.76 – 37.54] this week.

The price is now trading between two zones, below is the support and
above is the resistance [39.18 – 38.96]. One can enter trades in both
directions, but the main scenario still suggests purchases.

The trend key support is in the zone of [35.51 – 35.06]. The price can
reach it if Additional Zone is broken out.

###  **XAUUSD – gold**

Gold is rising form the trend key support [1673.6 - 1664.4]. There has
formed a buy pattern. Expect until the price reaches good buy levels on
the correction and enter long trades with a target at the high of May.

![LiteForex: Analysis for oil, gold and EUR/USD for 11.06.2020][4]

Yesterday, buyers broke out Intermediary Zone [1721.0 - 1716.4], so, the
gold short-term trend turned up. The US session closed above the zone.
Now, the target for short-term purchases is the upper Target Zone
[1771.3 – 1762.2].

Today, we start looking for buy entries. Good prices to enter purchases
are in the strong support zones, Additional Zone [1716.9 - 1714.6] and
Intermediary Zone [1694.0 — 1689.4].

 **[XAUUSD][6] Trading ideas for today:  **

Buy from level 1705.6. TakeProfit: 1764.4. StopLoss: 1687.2.

###  **EURUSD – euro/dollar**

The EUR/USD broke through the local high yesterday. So, the trend key
support should be moved. The key support is now in the zone of [1.1240 -
1.1222]. The weekly low is around this zone. If the price is corrected
down into this zone, it will be relevant to look for the pattern to buy
the euro-dollar.

![LiteForex: Analysis for oil, gold and EUR/USD for 11.06.2020][7]

The price, following the short-term uptrend, reached Target Zone 3
[1.1434 – 1.1416] yesterday. Traders started exiting large purchases and
entering local sell trades. As a result, the price has corrected down
into Intermediary Zone [1.1331 — 1.1322] today.

Now, I recommend expecting a buy signal. The upside target will be
yesterday’s high.

It will be relevant to sell if the price breaks out IZ, and the US
session closes the price below. If so, the short-term trend will turn
down, and the downside target will be the lower Target Zone [1.1240 -
1.1222].

 **[EURUSD][9] Trading ideas for today:  **

Buy according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone [1.1331 - 1.1322].
TakeProfit: 1.1420. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

> IZ - Intermediary Zone: responsible for the price momentum reversing

>

> TZ - Target Zone: a zone that is 75% likely to be reached after IZ
breakout.

>

> GZ - Gold Zone: zone in the medium-term momentum.

>

> All zones are calculated based on the average [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) price of the
instrument and margin requirements of the futures.
