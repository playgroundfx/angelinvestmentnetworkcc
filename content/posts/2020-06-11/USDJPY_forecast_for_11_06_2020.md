Yens comes back homeDmitri Demidenko

## Repatriation of capital into Japan and the weakness of the greenback
send the USD/JPY down

The time when the US dollar was a more popular safe haven than the
Japanese yen is over. The yen has now a good chance to stabilize without
being concerned that geopolitics and different shocks will strengthen
it. It turns out that the yen can grow without a drop in the global risk
appetite. Societe Generale says Japan now seems the “perfect place to
be,” especially in equities. Stable balance sheets of local
corporations, the growth of dividends, political stability, and
relatively low buy price allow the Japanese securities to lure back
foreign [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s.

Societe Generale increased its weighting on Japanese stocks to the
maximum. The firm recommends its clients to allocate their capitals with
45% of assets in fixed income and cash, 45% in equities, and 10% in
commodities. In my opinion, the capital inflow into Japan and the
weakness of the greenback are the major reasons for the [USD/JPY][1]
fall. TOPIX recouped three-quarters of the losses and has rebounded by
37%. Overseas traders realized they had made a mistake and started
buying Japanese securities. They sold more than $41 billion of Japanese
stock futures in the first five months of the year, the most since at
least 2015. However, in the second half of May, they turned net buyers,
loading up about $7 billion.

The rally of Nikkei 225 and TOPIX made the Japanese [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s change
their minds too. Earlier, amid an increase in the global risk appetite,
Japan’s [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s directed their capitals into the USA, which
strengthened the direct correlation between the [USD/JPY][1]. Now,
however, Japan’s stock market looks a good competitor to the US stock
market that seems to be entering the overbought territory. The Fed and
the OECD suggest the US economic recovery should look like the Nike
logo, while Japan’s economic recession is likely to be not as deep as it
was thought before. In the first quarter, Japan’s GDP contracted by
2.2%, which is less than the previous gauge of 3.4%.

According to 72% of 47 experts polled by Bloomberg, the BoJ should keep
the current parameters of the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) at the meeting on June
15-16. Since March, the central bank promised purchases of an unlimited
amount of government bonds, increased its [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/) purchases, and launched
credit programs of $700 billion. About 71% of analysts say the regulator
has done enough or more than enough, the need for the expansion of the
monetary stimulus is less, which is good [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) for the yen.

Therefore, amid the growth of the demand for Japan’s equities and the
weakness of the US dollar, it is relevant to sell the [USD/JPY][1] on
the rise using the [LiteForex convenient services][5]. The shorts
entered at level 100 based on the recommendations given in[ April][6]
and [May][7] should be held. The first downside targets are at 105.9 and
105.2.
