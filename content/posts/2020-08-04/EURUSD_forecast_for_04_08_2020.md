EUR/USD forecast: Dollar goes into politicsDmitri Demidenko

## Fundamental U.S. dollar forecast for today

### US jobs report for July can be one of the most significant political
events in 2020

If [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s bet on currencies depending on the epidemiological
situation, then the drop in the number of new coronavirus cases in the
U.S. to 47,000 per day, which is the lowest figure over the past four
weeks, should strengthen the US dollar. Besides, the US manufacturing
PMI rose to the highest level since March 2019. Furthermore, there is
positive [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) about the progress in the negotiations between Democrats
and Republicans in Congress on the extension of the US fiscal stimulus.
However, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are willing to pick up the [EUR/USD][1] uptrend, so,
even the slightest drop attracts new buyers.

Everything is relative. Earlier, the number of new COVID-19 cases was
growing by 40%-50% in the U.S., now, it is declining. Nonetheless, the
epidemiological situation in Europe is better than in the USA, which
can’t but influence the PMI.

However, the example of China proves that the initial growth momentum
could slow down further. If the US takes control of the virus, the
associated optimism can trigger the rebound of the purchasing managers
index. Yes, the long-term [EUR/USD][1] bullish factors, including the
inflow of portfolio investments into the euro-area markets and an
increase in the proportion of the euro in the global FX reserves will
continue working. However, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s wonder now if it is too early for
the pair to be trading above 1.2.

The question can well be answered by… politics. The USD trend is closely
correlated with Donald Trump’s approval ratings. That is why there were
massive sell-offs of the greenback after Trump had suggested a delay to
the 2020 US presidential election. Furthermore, the US jobs report for
July could become one of the most significant political events in 2020.

If the employment continues growing at the same pace as it did in the
May-June period, and the unemployment rate shrinks, the need for the
extra fiscal stimulus, called for by Democrats, will be less, and the
White House will stick to the idea of the US quick economic recovery.
Otherwise, if the jobs report is weak, Joe Biden’s approval ratings will
grow, pressing down the USD. Therefore, the publication of the US
employment data is a very important event for the dollar pairs in Forex.
Ahead of such important [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) releases, the markets usually consolidate.
Investors do not want to go ahead until the situation is clear. The only
thing that could encourage Forex traders to be active now is the fear of
missing out the [EUR/USD][1] uptrend.

Therefore, I suggest several scenarios. The [EUR/USD][1] consolidation
in the trading range of 1.166-1.186 is the most likely one. If the pair
breaks out the top of the trading range and continues its rally, it will
be an inadequate reaction to the US jobs employment data. If the US weak
jobs data are already priced in the euro-dollar, large [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are
likely to start exiting longs while all the rest are buying.
