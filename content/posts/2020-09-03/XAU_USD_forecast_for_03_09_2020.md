XAU/USD forecast: Gold goes down in the second waveDmitri Demidenko

## Fundamental gold price forecast for today

### The second wave of gold sell-offs could be greater than the first
one

When Jerome Powell announced the Fed’s shift to the average inflation
targeting, it seemed to be the end of the dollar uptrend. The low
interest rates in the USA should remain for a long time. It deprives the
greenback of its major benefit, encouraging gold buyers. Nonetheless,
the USD bears were soon set back. The strong dollar came back, and
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are willing to sell the [XAU/USD][1].

In early summer, gold hit its all-time high at $2080 per ounce. At that
time, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s were concerned about the future of the global economy,
aggressive monetary expansions of the world’s leading central banks, the
drop in the Treasury yield to its all-time low, the weakness of the US
dollar, and expectations of the US inflation growth. The capitals were
flowing into the gold [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/)s. However, no asset can rise indefinitely. The
first wave of the sell-offs in the gold market started when the US bond
market rates were growing. The second wave began when speculators were
exiting the EURUSD longs.

According to Commerzbank, to anticipate the future [XAU/USD][1] trend,
one should track the euro-dollar. The share of the euro in the structure
of the USD index is 57%. So, it is natural that the greenback has
strengthened after the ECB verbal interventions and the first deflation
in the euro area over the past four years. However, the inflation
expectations in the Eurozone are growing, so things are not as bad as
they seem. If the euro-area economy rebounds, the CPI will grow, which
should support the [EUR/USD][2] recovery. It will be a positive factor
for gold.

Gold buyers can also be supported by the US presidential election, which
already now are thought to be the most controversial since the Civil
War. The election is likely to cause turmoil in the financial markets,
increasing the demand for safe havens. This viewpoint was suggested by
Dynamic Precious Metals Fund, an asset manager that beat  _82_ % of
_its peers_  this year. The company believes the gold’s bull run to
continue.

In my opinion, the USD dollar should weaken in the long run, the
inflation will accelerate, and the treasury real yield will continue
falling. These factors mean that the [XAU/USD][1] uptrend should resume.
Nonetheless, in the short run, the [EUR/USD][2] is more likely to go
down, as [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s believe the ECB doesn’t want the euro to be too
strong and will expand QE in the euro area. These factors a bearish for
gold.

The gold price could drop deeper if the US jobs report for August is
better than the forecasts. In this case, gold should slide down to $1900
and $1865. It makes sense to enter long-term purchases close to level
$1865. Otherwise, a poor reading of the US nonfarm payrolls should weigh
on the greenback and push gold up to $2000 per ounce.
