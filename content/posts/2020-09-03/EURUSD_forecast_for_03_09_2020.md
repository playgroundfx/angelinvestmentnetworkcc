EUR/USD forecast: Euro is trapped in the illusionDmitri Demidenko

## Fundamental Euro forecast for today

### The real situation is far from what we think it to be

Technical analysis says the price chart considers all the factors.
However, the market gets trapped in the illusion from time to time. The
growth gap between the US and the EU economies, which has been driving
the [EUR/USD][1] up, could be a fiction. According to Deutsche Bank, the
EU financial aid package may lead will create thousands of “zombie
companies”, and Europe could lose competitiveness against the US. A
slight increase in European unemployment and public debt could also be a
fiction.

At the peak of the economic recession, the US unemployment surged from
3.5% to almost 15%, while the euro-area unemployment rate was up from
7.2% to 7.9%. It is associated with the impact of the fiscal stimulus on
the labor market. In the United States, assistance is provided to the
unemployed, in Europe, they are trying to save jobs. The euro area is
quite good at managing the symptoms of the disease, but it very slowly
adapts to a normal state.

Another fantasy is the insignificant growth of the national debt of the
eurozone countries in comparison with the US peer. According to the
Congressional Budget Office, the US debt-to-GDP ratio will increase from
98.2% to 104.4%. in 2020/2021. In Europe, the EU plan the EU's plan to
issue common bonds for $ 750 billion creates the illusion of a slight
increase in public debt because the obligations will not be included in
the government debt of any country in the eurozone.

Therefore, the real situation is far from what we believe in. Does it
mean the euro will drop to $1.1? No, it doesn’t. We all live in the
illusion, not only financial markets. Forex analysts expect the
situation of 2017 to repeat. Then, the [EUR/USD][1], after a drop from
level 1.2 associated with the inability to overcome the [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) barrier,
soared to 1.25 in the next five months. History repeats itself, doesn’t
it?

###  **Dynamics of EUR/USD**

The current market state has a lot in common with the events that
occurred six years ago. The [EUR/USD][1] rally started from below 1.1,
the price chart drew a shooting star pattern in the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) chart, which
signals a correction. Despite a drawdown, the euro risk reversals are
still up, which means the uptrend is likely to resume.

However, the market is now impressed by Philip Lane’s verbal
interventions. People familiar with the matter told Financial Times that
other members of the Governing Council share the viewpoint of the ECB
chief economist. One council member said that the euro’s appreciation is
worrisome, as the euro area is the most open economy in the world and
unusually dependent on global demand. Another council member believes
that, as the US Federal Reserve shifted to a more dovish average
inflation target, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s may interpret interest rates as being
structurally higher in the euro area, which could lead to a further rise
of the [EUR/USD][1].

In my opinion, as the ECB meeting on September 10 approaches, there
should be more talks that the ECB is interested in the euro’s
depreciation. In addition to a strong reading of the US jobs report for
August, this fact may send the euro down towards $1.176 and $1.173.
