Bears don’t fear FedDmitri Demidenko

## A ghost of currency wars wanders in Forex again

A man who wants to lead the orchestra must turn his back on the crowd.
The Fed has led its [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of disregard for the currency market for a
long time: it doesn’t say whether or not the dollar is priced correctly,
how its rate affects monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) or forecasts, and doesn’t link its
rate to exports or inflation.  It simply pumps enormous liquidity
volumes into the markets, cuts the federal funds rate by 150 base points
at special meetings and switches to  average inflation targeting
policies. Other central banks can’t behave this way. They have to fight
against walls of indifference, or else their currencies risk
consolidating.

The “don’t play against the Fed” principle didn’t frighten a brown bear
in the forest. Saying that the federal funds rate will be kept low for a
long time, Jerome Powell signed the greenback’s death warrant. However,
[EUR/USD][1] bears started counter-attacking just a few hours later.
What an insolence! Everyone should live in peace and friendship with the
central bank. Just like with the wife. My wife told me she was fed up
with me always agreeing with her. I answered that she was right.

Alas! Consent can’t break walls of indifference. Several banks voiced
their intent to soften monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) after the Fed chair’s statement
at Jackson Hole.  The Reserve Bank of New Zealand, the Bank of England
and the Bank of Japan said they were ready to extend the relief package
if necessary, while the ECB linked the rate to forecasts and monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). Key economist Philip Lane’s speech shocked the market, but
verbal interventions don’t fill the belly in this situation anyway.

The [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) knows many examples of when currency interventions were
useless. For example, the BoJ spent  $80 billion from January 1999 till
April 2000 in order to prevent the yen from consolidating, but [USD/JPY
][3] started growing only when the clouds gathered over Japan’s economy.
In November 2000, the ECB used the same instrument for reviving the euro
that had fallen to its [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) trough of $0.823, but the single
European currency started consolidating only when [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s lost
interest in the US economy. If direct interventions into Forex don’t
work, can mere words be helpful?

![LiteForex: Who started a currency war?][4]

On the contrary, verbal interventions can be harmful. They can draw
Donald Trump’s attention, and he believes speaking about currency rates
is his exceptional right. Before Trump became president, many thought he
must have problems if he’s in a bad mood. In fact, if Trump is in a bad
mood, it’s everyone else’s problem. I’m afraid Philip Lane’s passionate
speech may provoke the US president’s anger. The ECB risks being accused
of starting a currency war, which may be cold water for it because it’s
Jerome Powell who started “hostilities” at Jackson Hole.  However, it’s
scientifically proved that cold water dousing may be funny, regardless
of who’s being doused.
