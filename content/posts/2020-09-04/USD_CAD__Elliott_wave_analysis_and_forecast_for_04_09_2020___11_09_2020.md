USD/CAD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 04/09/2020 –
11/09/2020Alex Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 1.3242 with a target of 1.2900 – 1.2800.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
1.3242 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 1.3565 –
1.3780.

## [USD/CAD][1] remains likely to fall. Estimated pivot point is at a
level of 1.3242.

 **Analysis:** An ascending corrective wave of larger degree (B) of 4
has finished developing on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame, and wave (C) of 4
started forming. Presumably, the first wave 1 of (C) continues
developing on the H4 time frame, with wave v of 1 forming inside.
Apparently, the fifth wave of smaller degree (v) of v of 1 is developing
on the H1 time frame. If the presumption is correct, the pair may be
expected to continue falling to the levels of 1.2900 – 1.2800. The level
of 1.3242 is critical in this scenario as the breakout will enable the
pair to continue rising to the levels of 1.3565 – 1.3780.
