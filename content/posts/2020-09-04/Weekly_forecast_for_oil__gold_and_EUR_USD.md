Weekly forecast for oil, gold and EUR/USDAlex Rodionov

##  **O** **il price forecast for next wee** **k: USCrude analysis**

Oil has been corrected this week. The price has stopped in the support
zone Target Zone 5 [41.67 – 40.92]. The price hasn’t yet broken out, so
we still shall enter purchases according to the pattern.

The second support, which is the key one, is the zone of [37.34 –
36.72]. If the correction continues next week, and the price tests the
support, I will also recommend buying oil.

The upside target will be to break through the local high and reach
Target Zone 6 [49.17 — 48.42].

##  **Gold** **price forecast for next wee** **k:** **XAUUSD**
**analysis** ****

The gold price chart has drawn a triangle, which is a technical pattern
that signals the formation of the accumulation zone. The direction in
which the price exits the triangle will determine the direction of the
medium-term gold price trend. For next week, I suggest we expect the
price to break out the support or the resistance level, and enter a sell
or a buy trend, according to which of the important levels is broken
out.

If the price breaks out the support zone, it will tend to break through
the low of August. An additional target is the lower Target Zone 2
[1829.4 – 1820.1].

If the price breaks out the resistance, we shall buy the XAUUSD with the
target at the high of August 18 + the upper Target Zone 2 [2044.9 —
2036.2].

##  **E** **uro/dollar price forecast for next wee** **k:** **EURUSD**
**analysis** ****

This week, the EUR/USD broke through the local high of August 18 and
broke through the resistance Target Zone 4 [1.1914 – 1.1896]. Next, the
price started a deep correction and reached the trend key support
[1.1811 - 1.1791].

The sellers are trying to break out the support and turn the trend down.
We shall see if they succeed, and what the buyers will show reaction. To
enter new purchases, we need a buy pattern.

If there is a buy pattern close to the trend key support, I will
recommend entering buy trades with a target at the high of this week +
Target Zone 5 [1.2096 – 1.2078].

If the price breaks out the support zone next week, we shall sell the
EURUSD with a target at the lower Target Zone 2 [1.1611 — 1.1591].

to the pattern rules.
