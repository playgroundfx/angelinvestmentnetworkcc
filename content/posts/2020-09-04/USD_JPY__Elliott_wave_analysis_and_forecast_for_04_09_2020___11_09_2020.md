USD/JPY: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 04/09/2020 –
11/09/2020Alex Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 107.06 with a target of 104.19 – 103.30.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
107.06 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 108.14 –
109.85.

## [USD/JPY][1] remains likely to fall. Estimated pivot point is at a
level of 107.06.

 **Analysis:** On the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame, apparently a descending
correction of larger degree finished forming as wave B, and wave С
started developing, with the first wave 1 of (1) of C formed inside. On
the H4 time frame, a descending correction continues forming as wave 2
of (1), with wave c of 2 developing inside. Apparently, the fifth wave
of smaller degree (v) of c is developing on the H1 time frame.  If this
assumption is correct, the pair will continue to fall to 104.19 –
103.30. The level of 107.06 is critical in this scenario as the breakout
will enable the pair to continue growing to the levels of 108.14 –
109.85.
