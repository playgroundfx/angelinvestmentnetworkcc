After the upward impulse wave A ended, the cryptocurrency pair started
declining in the B correction. This correction is unfolding as a simple
zigzag [A]-[B]-[C], where the [A] impulse and the bullish correction [B]
have completed. There is now developing the final impulse wave [C]. It
will finish when the sub-waves (3)-(4)-(5) complete. The structure of
these waves is outlined in the chart. We shall monitor the market.

Like in previous trading days, the XRPUSD market is forming the long-
term sideways correction 4, which is an element of the global impulse
wave (C). The (C) wave is unfolding as a triple three, where the sub-
waves [w] and [x] have completed, and the final zigzag-shaped wave [y]
is currently forming. The price should be declining in the impulse wave
(c). When the (c) wave completes, the Ripple market should go up in the
final wave 5.

In the impulse wave C, displayed in the Ethereum price chart, the first
three parts have completed. There is now developing the down corrective
wave [4]. Wave [4] is likely to complete as a simple zigzag (a)-(b)-(c).
The bearish impulse wave (a) may have finished, and the market should
start rising in a small corrective wave (b). The entire correction [4]
could finish at a level of 346.04. Next, the market could turn up and
start rising.
