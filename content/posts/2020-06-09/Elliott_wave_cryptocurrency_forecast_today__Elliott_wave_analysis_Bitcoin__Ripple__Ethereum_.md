###  **Elliott wave[BTCUSD][1] analysis**

 **![LiteForex: Elliott wave cryptocurrency forecast today. Elliott wave
analysis Bitcoin, Ripple, Ethereum.][2]**

The chart displays the upward impulse wave A that is the beginning of
the global upward simple zigzag. Wave A consists of five sub-waves
[1]-[2]-[3]-[4]-[5]. There is now forming the final fifth wave that is
also an impulse. The market is likely to have completed corrective wave
(4), and there is developing the bullish wave (5). The price is likely
to be rising in wave (5) to a level of 11000.

When the upward impulse wave (A) completed, the market has started
moving up in the corrective wave (B) that may complete as a triple
zigzag W-X-Y. Zigzag W has completed. There is now developing the
linking wave X that is likely to be a triple zigzag. The sub-waves
[W]-[X]-[Y]-[X] have completed, so the price should be rising in the
final wave [Z] to a level of 0.218.

###  **Elliott wave[ETHUSD][5] analysis**

Like in the previous trading days, the market is forming the large
upward impulse wave A that is composed of five sub-waves. The chart
displays the final segment of the bullish impulse [3] and corrective
wave [4] that is a triangle. It is clear from the chart that the upward
impulse [5] has not yet completed. The first four legs of the impulse
should have completed, and the market is now moving up in the final wave
(5) of [5] to a level of 266.00.
