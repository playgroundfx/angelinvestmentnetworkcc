The BTCUSD market continues forming the upward corrective wave B as a
triple zigzag [w]-[x]-[y]-[x]-[z]. There is likely to be forming the
final bullish impulse wave 5 of (c) that is an element of the zigzag
[z]. The corrective wave B is likely to complete at a level around 8133,
next, the market may turn down and start declining in the C-wave to a
level around the previous low at 3773.

The XRPUSD market also continues forming the long-term triple zigzag,
namely, its final element, the bullish impulse wave (c). The price can
be shortly rising in wave 5 to a level of 0.211. Next, after the
corrective wave 4 completes, the price should start declining in wave 5
to a level around the previous low made by the bearish impulse 3, that
is level 0.109.

of 202.00. After that, the market will turn down and start declining in
wave 5. Wave 5 should complete at a level around 98.67, which is the
