Yen is back to the gameDmitri Demidenko

## The USD/JPY bears do not want to play a secondary role

After a 5% surge of the [USD/JPY][1] over the two weeks in March amid
the crash of the US stock indexes, some [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s start talking that the
yen has lost its status of the major safe-haven. In theory, the turn of
the US stock market down into the bear territory should have resulted in
the massive capital repatriation to Japan, but this didn’t occur. The
Japanese [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s preferred the greenback. However, as the S&P 500 was
rising, it was not beneficial to hold the US dollar in the investment
portfolios. As a result, the yen has covered a great part of the losses
in April, and the yen, among the G10 currencies, has been only major
currency up against the dollar this year.

HSBC estimates that Japan’s total overseas investment has grown by 75%
since 2014 and currently stands at about $ 1.4 trillion. However, the
merger and acquisition deals in Japan has significantly declined amid
the coronavirus outbreak. As a result, the Asian will receive dividends
in the next few months, and the current account surplus will be growing.
This creates a fundamental base for the USD/JPY downtrend. According to
the HSBC, the yen is still an appealing and strong currency.

The [USD/JPY][1] sellers are not concerned about the drop in Japan’s
services PMI to a new record low of 22.8 in April. Japan’s purchasing
managers index for manufacturing fell to 43.7 in April, indicating the
strongest contraction in the factory sector since the financial crisis
of 2008-2009. The PMI crash signals that the GDP could shrink more than
20% in the second quarter.

Japan’s government and the BoJ have spent every effort to fight with the
pandemic and recession. At its last meeting on April 27, the BoJ decided
to buy an unlimited amount of government bonds and to expand the
existing volume for the acquisition of corporate and commercial paper
bonds to ¥20 trillion ($186 billion).

In theory, the further monetary easing is a bear factor for the local
currency, however, the yen, on the contrary, strengthened after the
publication of the BoJ statement. First, in the time of crisis [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s
tend to preserve the capital, rather than increase it. So, the
willingness of the BoJ to hold the interest rates low is good [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) for
the [USD/JPY][1] bears. Second, the monetary policies pursued by the
Fed, the ECB, and other leading central banks are also ultra-easy, which
weakens the world’s major currencies. Third, the BoJ’s announcement of
the unlimited purchase of government bonds is just a formality. In fact,
it didn’t reach its target for the increase in the monetary base at ¥80
trillion earlier.

In my opinion, amid the strong uncertainty and high volatility, and the
monetary easing held by most global central banks, the yen will be
supported by the inflow of investment capital in the form of dividends
and reduction of outflows associated with a decrease in Japanese
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s’ activity in mergers and acquisitions. Therefore, if the
support at 106.75-106.8, the [USD/JPY][1] will be more likely to
continue falling.
