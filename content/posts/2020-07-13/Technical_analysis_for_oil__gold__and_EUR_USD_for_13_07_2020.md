Analysis for oil, gold, and EUR/USD for 13.07.2020Alex Rodionov

##  **Oil price forecast** **for** **today:** ** **USCrude****
******analysis**

Oil is trading in the medium-term uptrend. The price is now under the
strong resistance Target Zone 5 [41.67 – 40.92]. If the price breaks out
the resistance, the next upside target will be Target Zone 6 [49.17 –
48.42].

Otherwise, the price will be corrected down to the trend key support
[33.64 — 32.86].

![LiteForex: Technical analysis for oil, gold, and EUR/USD for
13.07.2020][1]

Last week, oil traders tested the resistance Target Zone 5 [41.67 –
40.92]. After the price had tested this zone, it was corrected down to
Additional Zone [39.32 - 39.15]. I wrote “Buy according to the pattern
in Additional Zone [39.32 - 39.15]. TakeProfit: 41.40. StopLoss:
according to the pattern rules” in the previous [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) trading
recommendations. There is no pattern to buy oil yet.

The price has stopped in the resistance zone of [40.37 - 40.20]. If
there is a sell signal in the chart, we shall enter short trades with
the target at the low of July 10.

If the price breaks out the resistance, it can well break through June’s
high and the high of last week.

###  **[USCrude][3]Trading ideas for today: **

##  **Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis**

In the longer timeframe for the gold price chart, it is clear that the
gold rates have stopped under the resistance Target Zone 6 [1817.2 –
1811.2]. It is yet too early to sell gold, we need a sell pattern
“double extreme” or some other technical analysis pattern to confirm the
idea to sell.

In the short-term gold trading chart, the price is trading in the short-
term uptrend. Last week, gold traders were testing Additional Zone
[1797.6 - 1795.6]. They did not break the zone out. There was a double
extreme buy pattern, but it didn’t work out. Immediately after that,
there emerged a false breakout price action pattern. According to that
pattern, we should have entered purchases.

The gold price is now moving up from the zone. The upside target is to
break through the high of last week. When the high is updated, we shall
see if the price will consolidate above level 1818.3. If it does, the
next buy target will in Target Zone [1862.8 – 1853.7]. If it doesn’t, we
shall consider selling gold in the correction.

##  **Euro to dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis**

It is clear from the medium-term timeframe that the EUR/USD is going to
break out the resistance at [1.1368 - 1.1350]. Expect the zone breakout
to mark the next upside target in Target Zone 2 [1.1550 – 1.1532].

The target for the current buy positions is the high of June.

![LiteForex: Technical analysis for oil, gold, and EUR/USD for
13.07.2020][7]

The short-term uptrend continued on Friday. There was just a correction
down to the trend key support zone. There emerged a good buy entry via
the false breakout of the previous low (July 7). For today, I recommend
holding up those purchases with the target at the top of Target Zone,
level 1.1385.

The strong resistance to buyers is Target Zone [1.1385 – 1.1367]. If the
price breaks out the zone, the next upside target will be Gold Zone
[1.1467 — 1.1458].

###  **[EURUSD][9] Trading ideas for today: **

Hold up buy trades entered in Intermediary Zone [1.1279 - 1.1270].
TakeProfit: 1.1385. StopLoss: 1.1253.

> IZ - Intermediary Zone: responsible for the price momentum reversing

>

> TZ - Target Zone: a zone that is 75% likely to be reached after IZ
breakout.

>

> GZ - Gold Zone: zone in the medium-term momentum.

>

> All zones are calculated based on the average [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) price of the
instrument and margin requirements of the futures.
