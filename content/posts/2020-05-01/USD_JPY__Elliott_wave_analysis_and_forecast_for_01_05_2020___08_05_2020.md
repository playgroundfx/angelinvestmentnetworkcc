USD/JPY: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 01/05/2020 –
08/05/2020Alex Geuta

## [USD/JPY][1] remains likely to fall. Estimated pivot point is at a
level of 108.09.

 **Main scenario:** consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 108.09 with a target of 103.00 – 101.08.

 **Alternative scenario:** ****breakout and consolidation above the
level of 108.09 will allow the pair to continue the rise up to the
levels of 109.51 – 111.80.

 **Analysis:** On the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame, supposedly, a big horizontal
correction finished forming as a triangle-shaped wave (В) of B. Wave (С)
of B started developing on the H4 time frame. Inside it, there’s the
first wave 1 of (C) formed, a local correction completed in the form of
wave 2 of (C) and wave 3 of (C) forming. Apparently, the third wave of
smaller degree iii of 3 of (C) is developing on the H1 time frame.  If
this assumption is correct, the pair will continue to drop to 103.00 –
101.08. The level of 108.09 is critical in this scenario as the breakout
will enable the pair to continue growing to the levels of 109.51 –
111.80.
