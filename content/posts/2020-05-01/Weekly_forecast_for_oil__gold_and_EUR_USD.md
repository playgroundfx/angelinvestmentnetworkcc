Weekly forecast for oil, gold and EUR/USDAlex Rodiоnov

###  **USCrude –** **oil** ****

Oil medium-term trend has reversed up this week via the breakout of the
key resistance [11.67 - 10.92]. According to the previous trading weekly
analytics, expect the retest of the zone to get good buy prices. The
upside target will be Target Zone 2 [19.17 - 18.42]. A reasonable level
for stop loss is below 10.92, at a sufficient distance.

The trend key support, taking into account the last changes in margin
requirements, is now at [6.77 - 5.77]. However, if the price reaches
this support, all the price growth occured this week will be absorbed,
which will create a contradiction with the classical technical analysis.
Therefore, the most likely scenario to buy oil is to enter purchases on
the retest of the broken-out Target Zone. An alternative scenario: buy
according to the pattern in the key support zone.

###  **XAUUSD – gold**

Gold price has been again corrected down to the trend key support
[1663.9 – 1655.6]. The buy pattern hasn’t been traded. I suggest
expecting a new buy signal and detail the entry point in shorter
timeframes. The uptrend continues. The buy target is Target Zone 5
[1757.2 – 1751.2].

An alternative scenario to sell gold will be relevant is the price
breaks out the key support and consolidates below it. In this case, we
shall enter sell positions with the target in the lower Target Zone 2
[1580.4 — 1572.1].

###  **EURUSD – euro/dollar**

The EUR/USD has tested the key resistance of the medium-term downtrend
[1.0927 – 1.0909]. Until the price consolidates above the zone, it will
be relevant to enter sell trades according to the pattern with the
target at April’s low.

If the US session closes the price above the resistance, the trend will
reverse up. In this case, forget about sell trades and enter purchases
with the target at the upper Target Zone 2 [1.1109 – 1.1091].

According to the technical analysis, the border of the downtrend is at
level 1.0988.
