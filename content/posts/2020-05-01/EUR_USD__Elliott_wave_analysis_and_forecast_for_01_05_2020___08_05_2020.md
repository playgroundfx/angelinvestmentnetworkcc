EUR/USD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 01/05/2020 –
08/05/2020Alex Geuta

## The pair [EUR/USD ][1]remains likely to grow. Estimated pivot point
is at a level of 1.0720.

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions from corrections above the
level of 1.0720 with a target of 1.1150 – 1.1496.

 **Alternative scenario:** ****breakout and consolidation below the
level of 1.0720 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels
of 1.0528 – 1.0414.

 **Analysis:** Supposedly, the descending fifth wave of larger degree
(5) of С continues developing on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame, with the first
wave 1 of (5) and correction 2 of (5) formed inside. The third wave 3 of
(5) started developing on the H4 time frame, with an ascending
correction developing in the form of wave ii of 3 inside. Apparently,
wave  (c) of ii is developing on the H1 time frame. If this assumption
is correct, the pair will continue to rise to 1.1150 – 1.1496. The level
of 1.0720 is critical in this scenario. Its breakout will allow the pair
to continue falling to the levels of 1.0528 – 1.0414.
