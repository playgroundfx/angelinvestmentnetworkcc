GBP/USD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 03.07.20 – 10.07.20Alex
Geuta

## The pair [GBP/USD][1] remains likely to grow. Estimated pivot point
is at the level of 1.2250.

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions from corrections above the
level of 1.2250 with the target in 1.2880 – 1.3150.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
1.2250 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of 1.1635
– 1.1409.

 **Analysis:** Supposedly, the fifth wave of a larger degree V finished
developing on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame, with wave (С) of V completed inside.
On the 4-hour time frame the first inceptive wave of a new trend (1) of
1 and a correction is completed in the form of wave 2 of (1) which took
the form of a flat. On the H1 time frame, apparently, wave (3) has
started developing, inside which the first wave of a smaller degree i of
1 of (3) has been completed. If the presumption is correct, the pair
will continue to rise to the levels of 1.2880 – 1.3150. The level of
1.2250 is critical in this scenario as the breakout of it will enable
the pair to continue declining to the levels of 1.1635 – 1.1409.
