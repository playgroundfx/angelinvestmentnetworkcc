Weekly forecast for oil, gold and EUR/USDAlex Rodiоnov

##  **O** **il price forecast for next wee** **k: USCrude analysis**

The entire week, oil has been trading below Target Zone 5 [41.67 -
40.92], the middle-term trend is, however, up.

It is clear from the chart that the oil price is gradually growing. The
upside target is to break through the high of June. Once June high is
broken through, we shall see if the buyers will consolidate the price
above TZ 5. If they do, the next buy target will be TZ 6 [49.17 —
48.42].

The trend key support is now in the price range of [33.64 – 32.86]. To
buy oil at good prices, I suggest expecting the test of the support zone
and look for a buy pattern.

###  **[USCrude][2]Trading tips for the upcoming week:**

Buy according to the pattern in Target Zone [33.64 - 32.86]. TakeProfit:
41.40. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

##  **Gold** **price forecast for next wee** **k:** **XAUUSD**
**analysis** ****

Gold middle-term uptrend continues. The upside target is Target Zone 6
[1817.2 - 1811.2].

The price has broken through the previous local high this week.
Therefore, the trend key support is now in the zone of [1707.1 –
1699.0]. To enter new gold buy trades at good prices, we shall expect
the price correction down to the key support zone and look for a buy
pattern there.

There have been no sell signals so far. One could sell gold in the
correction if there is a false breakout pattern in the longer timeframe.

Buy according to the pattern in Target Zone [1707.1 - 1699.0].
TakeProfit: 1788.0, Target Zone 6 [1817.2 - 1811.2]. StopLoss: according
to the pattern rules.

##  **E** **uro/dollar price forecast for next wee** **k:** **EURUSD**
**analysis** ****

The trading ideas for this week were as follows:

  1. If the support at [1.1240 – 1.1222] is held up, it will be relevant to buy the euro with the target to break through the high of this week.
  2. If the low of last week is broken through, we shall move the resistance and enter new sell trades in the zone.

As you see from the chart, the eurusd traders are holding up the support
at [1.1240 – 1.1222]. There is no sell pattern, although the EURUSD
middle-term trend is down, according to the margin zone methodology.

Therefore, I recommend either holding the buy trades entered in the
support zone of [1.1240 – 1.1222] or entering new purchases at the
current prices with a stop loss below the weekly low.

If the price goes down and breaks through the weekly low, there will
emerge a sell pattern, and we shall look for a sell entry.

###  **[EURUSD][7]  Trading tips for the upcoming week:**

  1. Hold up buy trades entered in Target Zone [1.1240 - 1.1222]. TakeProfit: 1.1410. StopLoss: 1.1180.

  2. Buy at current prices. TakeProfit: 1.1410. StopLoss: 1.1180.

> IZ - Intermediary Zone: responsible for the price momentum reversing

>

> TZ - Target Zone: a zone that is 75% likely to be reached after IZ
breakout.

>

> GZ - Gold Zone: zone in the medium-term momentum.

>

> All zones are calculated based on the average [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) price of the
instrument and margin requirements of the futures.
