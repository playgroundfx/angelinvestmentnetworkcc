USD/JPY: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 03.07.20 – 10.07.20Alex
Geuta

## [USD/JPY][1] is likely to rise. Estimated pivot point is at the level
of 106.77.

 **Main scenario:**  consider long positions from correction above the
level of 106.77 with the target in 108.60 – 109.84.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
106.77 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of 105.21
– 104.50.

 **Analysis:** On the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame, apparently a descending
correction of larger degree finished forming as wave B and wave С
started developing. On the H4 time frame, the first wave 1 of (1) of C
has been formed and a local correction as wave 2 of (1) has also been
formed. On the H1 time frame, the third wave 3 of (1) has started
developing, inside which the first inceptive wave of a new trend of a
smaller degree (i) of i of 3 is developing. If the presumption is
correct, the pair will continue to rise to the levels of 108.60 –
109.84.  The level of 106.77 is critical in this scenario as its
breakout will enable the pair to continue declining to the levels of
105.21 – 104.50.
