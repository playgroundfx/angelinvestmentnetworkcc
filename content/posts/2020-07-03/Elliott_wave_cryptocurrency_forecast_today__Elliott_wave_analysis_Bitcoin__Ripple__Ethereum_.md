## Elliott wave forecast for BTCUSD, ETHUSD, XRPUSD for today

###  **Elliott wave[BTCUSD][1] analysis**

 **![LiteForex: Elliott wave cryptocurrency forecast today. Elliott wave
analysis Bitcoin, Ripple, Ethereum.][2]**

Like in previous trading weeks, the market is forming the sideways
corrective wave [4] as a double zigzag (W)-(X)-(Y). Presumably, there is
forming the final element of the sub-wave (Y), which is a bear double
zigzag W-X-Y. In the near future, the price could be declining in the
impulse wave [c] to a level of 8809.17. This level is in the support
zone.

###  **Elliott wave[XRPUSD][3] analysis**

 **![LiteForex: Elliott wave cryptocurrency forecast today. Elliott wave
analysis Bitcoin, Ripple, Ethereum.][4]**

There continues forming the long-term corrective wave (B) as a down
double zigzag W-X-Y. The market is now forming the bear wave Y that is
also a double zigzag [W]-[X]-[Y]. Wave [Y] currently unfolding is
composed of the sub-waves (A)-(B)-(C). Wave (A) is a five-wave impulse,
(B) is a horizontal contracting triangle, and (C) is an impulse that has
not yet completed. Presumably, the price should continue declining in
impulse (C) to a level of 0.165.

###  **Elliott wave[ETHUSD][5] analysis**

 **![LiteForex: Elliott wave cryptocurrency forecast today. Elliott wave
analysis Bitcoin, Ripple, Ethereum.][6]**

The ETHUSD continues forming the long-term corrective wave (4) that is
composed of the sub-waves W-X-Y. There is now unfolding the down wave Y
that is likely to complete as a simple zigzag [a]-[b]-[c]. There have
completed the impulse wave [a] and the upward corrective wave [b] that
is a zigzag. The ETH price is now declining in the impulse wave [c]. The
[c] wave should complete at a level of around the previous low at
215.45.
