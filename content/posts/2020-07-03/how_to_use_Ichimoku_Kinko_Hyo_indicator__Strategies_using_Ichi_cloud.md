Ichimoku cloud ([Ichimoku Kinko Hyo](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/ichimoku-kinko-hyo.html) indicator)Alex Rodiоnov

## A detailed overview of [Ichimoku Kinko Hyo](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/ichimoku-kinko-hyo.html) indicator and trading
strategies using Ichi cloud

Today, I will explain [how to](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-trading-how-to/) use the [Ichimoku Kinko Hyo](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/ichimoku-kinko-hyo.html) indicator, or
Ichimoku (Ichi Cloud) for short. I will cover in detail how the Ichimoku
Kinko Hyo works and what is Ichimoku trading system. I will also write
about the [Ichimoku Kinko Hyo](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/ichimoku-kinko-hyo.html) best settings and [how to](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-trading-how-to/) trade using
[Ichimoku Kinko Hyo](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/ichimoku-kinko-hyo.html). And finally, I will explain the Japanese candlestick
signals in the Forex Ichimoku trading system.

###  **What is the Ichimoku indicator** **?**

Forex Ichimoku trading system combines three technical tools in a single
[Ichimoku Kinko Hyo](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/ichimoku-kinko-hyo.html) (IKH) indicator to trade Forex. [Ichimoku Kinko Hyo](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/ichimoku-kinko-hyo.html) is
used to gauge the future price momentum and to determine the future
support and resistance zones to make profitable trades. The term
[Ichimoku Kinko Hyo](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/ichimoku-kinko-hyo.html) is Asian, namely, Japanese. Ichimoku translates to “a
glance”, Kinko means “equilibrium”, while Hyo is Japanese for “chart”.
Altogether, [Ichimoku Kinko Hyo](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/ichimoku-kinko-hyo.html) translates to “a glance at a chart in
equilibrium”.

This all-in-one technical indicator is composed of five lines, which are
called tenkan-sen, kijun-sen, senkou span A, senkou span B and chikou
span. Ichimoku is a Japanese forex analysis tool, which allows traders
to analyze charts faster and more accurately. Using the Ichimoku trading
systems is quite common in the forex market, especially at the Asian
trade sessions.

## 1\. History of [Ichimoku Kinko Hyo](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/ichimoku-kinko-hyo.html) indicator

The [Ichimoku Kinko Hyo](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/ichimoku-kinko-hyo.html), or Ichimoku for short, is a standard trend
indicator included in the list of built-in indicators of the Meta Trader
and other trading platforms.

The Ichimoku technical indicator was developed by Goichi Hosoda, a
Japanese journalist, in the late 1930s. The analyst published his
article in the trading journals, he was used to be known as Ichimoku
Sanjin.

The technical analysis indicator was named after his pseudonym. The
original aim was to predict the trend of the Japanese major stock index
Nikkei. The primary task of the indicator is the identification of a
trend that is represented as the signal line, and the secondary task is
to show the support/resistance levels.

Although Ichimoku developed the tool before World War Two, he released
his findings to the general public much later, in 1968.  He spent 30
years perfecting the technique.

## 2\. Ichimoku's Graphic Environment: [how to](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-trading-how-to/) read Ichimoku cloud
charts?

The below screenshot displays how the indicator looks in the price chart
with the default settings.

![LiteForex: Ichimoku indicator: [how to](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-trading-how-to/) use [Ichimoku Kinko Hyo](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/ichimoku-kinko-hyo.html)
indicator? Strategies using Ichi cloud][1]

Key elements of the indicator:

 **Tenkan sen** (the red line). ****It is the average value of the
highest high and the lowest low for the first time period. The default
value 9.

 **Kijun sen** (the blue line). It is the average value of the highest
high and the lowest low for the second time period. The default value is
26.

 **Senkou Span A** and **Senkou Span B** form the edges of the cloud.
The A line averages the values of Tenkan and Kijun, it is plotted 26
periods ahead. The B line calculates the average of the highest high and
the lowest low over the past 52 time periods. It is also plotted 26
periods ahead.

 **Chikou Span** (the green line). It is the so-called lagging span. It
calculates today's closing price projected back 26 days on the chart.

In addition to the base lines, there are some other prominent elements
of the indicator, filled zones. They are the so-called **clouds**. The
cloud is the area between the Senkou lines А and B.

If Senkou A is below Senkou B, the zone is purple, which signals a
downtrend.

If Senkou A is above Senkou B, the zone is orange and the trend is up.

## 3\. How to use [Ichimoku Kinko Hyo](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/ichimoku-kinko-hyo.html) Indicator?

We have studied technical aspects of the lines’ calculation. Now, let us
see what these lines are used for and what they mean.

In general, the Ichimoku cloud is designed to spot direction and
momentum in order to help you make buy and sell decisions more easily.
You can have a brief look at the chart and see the trend direction and
the price location relative to the support/resistance levels, and then,
you can look for a corresponding pattern to enter a buy or sell trade.

> An important note. The tool was designed to analyze quite long
timeframes, [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) and weekly charts of the Nikkei. Later, this algorithm
was applied to the forex chart analysis.

>

> Besides, financial are more volatile than 90 years ago. The indicator
still quite accurately anticipates middle- and long-term trends, but it
can also be employed in shorter Forex trading timeframes, starting from
H1.

I do **not recommend** using timeframes **shorter than one hour**.
Perfect timeframes to trade with the Ichimoku cloud are H1-D1.

You can trade any currency pairs.

###  **3.1. How to identify the trend using Ichimoku Cloud?**

 **The long-term trend** is defined using the filled zones, Ichimoku
clouds. If the price is trading below the cloud, the trend is down. If
the price ticker in the chart is trading above the cloud, the trend is
up.

The color of the cloud is also important. A purple cloud means that the
price could fall soon. An orange cloud signals that the price should
start rising soon.

A perfect case for entering buy trades is when the price is trading
above the orange cloud.

When the price is trading inside a cloud it means there is no clear
trend.

![LiteForex: Ichimoku indicator: [how to](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-trading-how-to/) use [Ichimoku Kinko Hyo](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/ichimoku-kinko-hyo.html)
indicator? Strategies using Ichi cloud][2]

The **medium-term trend** is defined by the Kijun line, and the **short-
term trend** is indicated by the Tenkan line. These lines are basically
common moving averages, but the calculation is different. They are the
average of high and low over a particular time. There is an opinion
among the speculators trading with the Ichimoku cloud that the Tenkan
and Kijun lines are more accurate than common EMAs.

You should also assess the direction of these lines and the angle. The
more acute is the angle, the stronger is the trend.

When Tenkan and Kijun are horizontal, there is the accumulation zone in
the market.

indicator? Strategies using Ichi cloud][3]

>

>  **As the Ichimoku technical tool is a leading indicator, it can be
used to anticipate the market situation in the medium-term and long-term
outlook. The clouds projected into the future give clues on possible
movements of the trend.**

The below screenshots present the examples of such projections:

![LiteForex: Ichimoku indicator: [how to](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-trading-how-to/) use [Ichimoku Kinko Hyo](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/ichimoku-kinko-hyo.html)
indicator? Strategies using Ichi cloud][4]

![LiteForex: Ichimoku indicator: [how to](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-trading-how-to/) use [Ichimoku Kinko Hyo](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/ichimoku-kinko-hyo.html)
indicator? Strategies using Ichi cloud][5]

###  **3.2. The role of dynamic levels of [Ichimoku Kinko Hyo](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/ichimoku-kinko-hyo.html)**

All Ichimoku lines, except the Chikou span, may serve as important
levels. It is suggested that the Tenkan line is rather weak, while the
Kijun line is a much more important level.

Senkou A and Senkou B are key levels, which are the strongest. The cloud
itself is also a level.

Let us see how it works on an example:

![LiteForex: Ichimoku indicator: [how to](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-trading-how-to/) use [Ichimoku Kinko Hyo](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/ichimoku-kinko-hyo.html)
indicator? Strategies using Ichi cloud][6]

###  **3.3. Flat zones - Ichi clouds**

Flat zones are Ichimoku clouds, within which you can also trade. As you
know, when an instrument is trading flat, one should enter trades at the
borders of the trading range. If the price goes into the filled zone,
the Senkou A and Senkou B become reference levels, where one could enter
trades with targets at the opposite level.

![LiteForex: Ichimoku indicator: [how to](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-trading-how-to/) use [Ichimoku Kinko Hyo](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/ichimoku-kinko-hyo.html)
indicator? Strategies using Ichi cloud][7]

The above figure displays the[ GBPUSD][8] H1 chart. You can see that, on
April 23, 2022, the price broke through the Senkou A line and entered
the cloud.

Next, via the retest of the broken-out Senkou A, the price reached
Senkou B and even went beyond the cloud zone. At the next bar, however,
the price rolled back to the trading range, drawing a false breakout
pattern. The false breakout of the Senkou B was a signal to enter a sell
trade with the target at the opposing strong level.

Note that the price has twice tested the Senkou A line from above after
it broke the line out. A buy pattern was formed at the Asian session
and, later, at the European session. At the U.S. session, the market
sent a signal to sell the[ GBPUSD][8] **.**

###  **3.4. The role of the Chikou span oscillator**

Basically, the Chikou line is a momentum indicator. Like any oscillator,
it is designed to indicate the price deviation from the average value.
Significant deviations create the overbought/oversold zones, which
indicates a potential correction or a trend reversal.

## 4\. Parameters and values: [Ichimoku Kinko Hyo](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/ichimoku-kinko-hyo.html) best settings

Let us enter the indicator parameters. We see three variables:

  1. Tenkan period (default value = 9)
  2. Kijun period (default value = 26)
  3. Senkou Span B period ( default value = 52)

![LiteForex: Ichimoku indicator: [how to](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-trading-how-to/) use [Ichimoku Kinko Hyo](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/ichimoku-kinko-hyo.html)
indicator? Strategies using Ichi cloud][9]

The default settings of the Ichimoku cloud are quite effective, so, I do
not recommend [beginners](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-for-beginners/) to change them. When you study the working
principle of the Ichimoku tool, you can experiment with its parameters.

Originally, Goichi Hosoda, when developing the indicator, referred to
the Japanese stock market and Japanese working days, which were six days
a week at that time. So, he took a period of 1.5 weeks for the Tenkan
line. 26 period originally meant working days in a month, and 52 is the
number of weeks in a year.

You can set the indicator parameters according to the current
conditions:

  * Tenkan = 5
  * Kijun = 20
  * Senkou Span B = 52

As a result, you will have the data changing more dynamically, but this
is not always better. Anyway, you should test the changed parameters and
compare them with the default values. Only after that, you can decide.

## 5\. How to read Ichimoku cloud charts and [how to](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-trading-how-to/) trade using Ichimoku
Kinko Hyo?

###  **5.1.  Patterns of Tenkan and Kijun lines**

Traders usually consider signals created by the Tenkan and Kijun lines
in two cases:

  * When the lines cross;
  * When the lines are facing in the same direction.

 **Ichimoku Tenkan and Kijun are crossing**

When the Tenkan line crosses the Kijun **upside** , there is a **Golden
Cross** pattern. This is a buy pattern.

When the Tenkan line crosses the Kijun **downside** , there is a **Dead
Cross** pattern. This a sell pattern.

![LiteForex: Ichimoku indicator: [how to](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-trading-how-to/) use [Ichimoku Kinko Hyo](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/ichimoku-kinko-hyo.html)
indicator? Strategies using Ichi cloud][10]

Based on the market situation, the above patterns may signal the trend
continuation or correction. They should be taken into account, but they
are not the strongest signals, so, I recommend trading according to the
patterns that are consistent with the general trend. To trade in the
correction, i.e. counter the trend, there should additional confirming
signals.

 **How to trade the Tenkan and Kijun crossing?**

You can enter a trade once the signal bar closes. A stop loss is set
beyond the next local high or low. Another option is to enter a trade at
the breakthrough of the local high or low in the direction suggested by
the signal (i.e. if it is a buy pattern, you enter when the price breaks
through the local high).

There is no universal entry rule. You should make a decision according
to the particular market situation and your personal trading style.

![LiteForex: Ichimoku indicator: [how to](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-trading-how-to/) use [Ichimoku Kinko Hyo](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/ichimoku-kinko-hyo.html)
indicator? Strategies using Ichi cloud][11]

 **Kijun and Tenkan alignment pattern**

Kijun and Tenkan's alignment in the same direction means that the local
and middle-term trends are the same, which suggests entering a trade.
You should also analyze the long-term trend when you want to enter a
trade based on the alignment of the Ichimoku Kijun and Tenkan lines. The
long-term trend must confirm the idea to buy or sell a trading
instrument.

You can enter a trade immediately after a trending movement starts when
the lines have located in the same direction. You can also enter a trade
in the middle of the trend, but, in this case, you’d better expect a
correction or the test of the red or the blue line or the zone that is
created between these lines.

![LiteForex: Ichimoku indicator: [how to](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-trading-how-to/) use [Ichimoku Kinko Hyo](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/ichimoku-kinko-hyo.html)
indicator? Strategies using Ichi cloud][12]

###  **5.2. Senkou Span signals (A and B)**

Signals sent by the Senkou Span lines and the cloud they create. The
Senkou span A and B lines could be the support or resistance levels,
depending on the trend. The Senkou Span A is a less important level, the
Senkou Span B is thought to be stronger, it marks the border of the
long-term trend.

The cloud’s color changes when the faster Senkou Span A crosses the
slower Senkou Span B, and so, there are early signals of the trend
reversal. Therefore, entering a trade after these lines cross will be at
the inceptive stage of a new trend. Here is the example of trading
signals occurred when the cloud’s color changes:

![LiteForex: Ichimoku indicator: [how to](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-trading-how-to/) use [Ichimoku Kinko Hyo](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/ichimoku-kinko-hyo.html)
indicator? Strategies using Ichi cloud][13]

I recommend entering a trade after the Ichimoku cloud has changed the
color. A Stop Loss, in a perfect situation, is put at some distance from
the cloud. Note that the new cloud forms 26 periods ahead, so pay
attention to the moment when the signal to buy or sell the pound was
formed in the above screenshot.

###  **5.3 The signal when the price breaks out the Senkou Span B.**

There is another signal, a leading one, when the price breaks out the
Senkou Span B. The line itself is a dynamic level and marks the trend
border. Therefore, if the outer border is not broken, the trend is
likely to continue. If the price breaks through the filled zone, the
trend should reverse soon.

Let us study the examples of the rebound and the breakout of the Senkou
Span B line. I recommend you to pay attention to the breakouts and the
price further movement:

![LiteForex: Ichimoku indicator: [how to](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-trading-how-to/) use [Ichimoku Kinko Hyo](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/ichimoku-kinko-hyo.html)
indicator? Strategies using Ichi cloud][14]

###  **5.4. Trading within Ichimoku cloud**

When the price is trading within the filled are, the cloud, it means
there is forming an accumulation zone or flat. When the price is trading
flat, one should enter trades at the borders of the range, and this
trading strategy is not as simple as trading with the trend.

To have a more or less wide trading range, you need to expect cloud
expansion. It is not always relevant to enter trades when the price is
within the Ichimoku cloud.

Trading in the range suggests entering trades in the direction of the
Senkou Span B when the price breaks out the Senkou Span A. When the
price reaches Senkou Span B you should be trading in the direction of
the first line and so on.

I do not recommend one to use limit orders or enter a trade immediately
after the price breaks out the Senkou Span A. First, the breakout could
be false. Second, the range within the cloud usually doesn’t allow
entering on the breakout with an acceptable Reward/Risk ratio (2/1 or
more).

Tenkan and Kijun in the Ichimoku cloud are still strong levels. It is
safer to enter trades at the levels around these lines.

![LiteForex: Ichimoku indicator: [how to](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-trading-how-to/) use [Ichimoku Kinko Hyo](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/ichimoku-kinko-hyo.html)
indicator? Strategies using Ichi cloud][15]

The above screenshot displays two different cases. In the left figure,
the price was trading between Span A and Span B. In the right one, the
Tenkan and Kijun were also used as strong levels.

Trading in the Ichimoku cloud is employed by professional traders who
know what they do. To detail the entry point, they use shorter
timeframes and the Japanese candlestick patterns. I do not recommend
newbies to trade in the cloud, as this trading strategy is quite
difficult. Beginner traders should first master trading according to
simpler and stronger signals described above.

 **5.5. Chikou Span**

As I wrote earlier, the Chikou Span serves as an oscillator in the
Ichimoku trading system. Therefore, the first thing you should pay
attention to is how the price has deviated from the green line. A wide
gap between the oscillator and the current price means there should soon
start a correction opposite to the main trend.

If you witness such a situation and the Japanese candlesticks generate
an additional pattern to buy or sell counter the major trend, you can
use this important signal and trade in the direction of the correction.

Another important signal appears when the Chikou Span crosses the price
chart. When the Chikou Span line crosses the price chart from below,
this is a buy signal. If the Ichimoku Chikou comes from above, this is a
sell signal.

You should remember that the oscillator is projected back 26 bars.
Approximately as many days, according to the Ichimoku tool developer,
large traders need to accumulate the position before the further strong
move.

![LiteForex: Ichimoku indicator: [how to](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-trading-how-to/) use [Ichimoku Kinko Hyo](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/ichimoku-kinko-hyo.html)
indicator? Strategies using Ichi cloud][16]

As you see from the above example, the bar on the right of the vertical
line signals the Chikou Span breakout upside or downside 26 bars ago.
The rectangle highlights the price range where this pattern has formed
as of now. The arrows mark the further price move in the pattern
direction. This pattern rarely occurs, but it provides a strong signal
in the Ichimoku system.

 **5.6. All the lines are arranged in the same direction**

When all the indicator’s lines are facing in the same direction, there
is a strong pattern that suggests entering a trade in the trend
direction.

![LiteForex: Ichimoku indicator: [how to](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-trading-how-to/) use [Ichimoku Kinko Hyo](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/ichimoku-kinko-hyo.html)
indicator? Strategies using Ichi cloud][17]

You see from the examples that the Ichimoku cloud, the Tenkan, and Kijun
are facing in the same direction, which is the only possible way to
enter a trade.

## 6\. Japanese candlesticks in the Forex Ichimoku trading system

Ichimoku Sanjin stressed the importance of using the Japanese
candlestick analysis when trading the Ichimoku signals. Without
analyzing the patterns generated by the Japanese candlesticks, the
probability that the trade will be successful is about 60%-70%. However,
if professional trades apply the analysis of Japanese candlesticks as an
additional filter, they can reach an 80% chance of success or even more.

Here, the Ichimoku trading strategy becomes more complicated, and you
will have to miss some signals. However, if you practice the candlestick
analysis, you will achieve better results as you will cut the potential
stop loss size, detail the entry point more accurately and exit the
trades on time.

I recommend you to confirm your trading ideas to buy or sell employing
the signals delivered by simple candlestick patterns. You can also
employ Price Action patterns. You do not have to learn and trade all the
patterns.

Three or five most common price patterns will be enough, provided you
use them often. After all, an indicator is just a derivative of the
price movements, and the price chart is always primary. Only the price
movements indicate the real market situation.

I covered in detail the most important price action patterns in the
previous educational article, [Price Action Forex strategies][18].

### 7\. Conclusion and a trader opinion of [Ichimoku Kinko Hyo](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/ichimoku-kinko-hyo.html)

The [Ichimoku Kinko Hyo](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/ichimoku-kinko-hyo.html) indicator is the most complicated tool among

If you are a newbie, I recommend you to start studying the Ichimoku
indicator and strategies trading with a long-term trend. When you go
through this stage and gain more trading experience, you can employ
other patterns as well.

Do not forget to confirm your trading ideas to buy or sell with
candlestick patterns. This will allow you to be more confident when
making trading decisions and get a better Reward/Risk ratio. I think
using a Price Action Forex strategy when you considering entries at the
key levels will help you increase the final profit.

### FAQs

How to trade using [Ichimoku Kinko Hyo](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/ichimoku-kinko-hyo.html)?

According to the location of the lines, you can determine the trend’s
strength and direction. The trend is down if the Tenkan-sen and the
Kijun-sen are above the price (the faster line, the Tenkan-sen, is
closer to the price).  
And vice versa, if the lines are below the price (the Tenkan-sen is
closer to the price). There is a steady uptrend.  
  
If the fast Tenkan-sen crosses below the slow Kijun-sen, and the lines
are crossing above the price (the price is below the lines), it may
signal the price should soon turn down.  
And vice versa, If the fast Tenkan-sen crosses above the slow Kijun-sen,
and the lines are crossing below the price (the price is above the
lines), it may signal the price should soon turn up.  
  
These crossover trade signals may be lagging, so traders are not advised
to rely exclusively on the Ichimoku indicator and its elements.
