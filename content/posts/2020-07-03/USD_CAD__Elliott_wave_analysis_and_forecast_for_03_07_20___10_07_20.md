USD/CAD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 03.07.20 – 10.07.20Alex
Geuta

## [USD/CAD][1] remains likely to grow. Estimated pivot point is at the
level of 1.3486.

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions from corrections above the
level of 1.3486 with a target of 1.3740 – 1.3797.

 **Alternative scenario:** ****Breakout and consolidation below the
level of 1.3486 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels
of 1.3315 – 1.3189.

 **Analysis:** On the D1 time frame, the third wave of a larger degree
is forming (3) which includes wave 1 of (3). On the 4-hour time frame, a
downward correction in the form of wave 2 of (3) has been completed and
the development of wave 3 of (3) has begun. On the H1 time frame, the
first wave of a smaller degree (i) of i of 3 is forming and if the
assumption is correct, the growth of the pair will continue to the
levels of 1.3740 – 1.3797. The level of 1.3486 is critical in this
scenario as a breakout will enable the pair to continue declining to the
levels of 1.3315 – 1.3189.
