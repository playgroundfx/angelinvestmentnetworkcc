EUR/USD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 03.07.20 – 10.07.20Alex
Geuta

## The pair [EUR/USD][1] remains likely to grow. Estimated pivot point
is at the level of 1.1180.

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions from corrections above the
level of 1.1180 with the target in 1.1495 – 1.1605.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
1.1180 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of 1.1095
– 1.1019.

 **Analysis:** Supposedly, a descending correction of larger degree
finished developing on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame in the form of wave 2 and
the third wave 3 started developing. On the H4 time frame the inceptive
wave 1 of (3) of a new trend is forming, with wave iii of 1 forming
inside. On the H1 time frame, apparently, the third wave of smaller
degree (iii) of iii of 1 formed, a local correction developed in the
form of wave (iv) of iii of 1 and the fifth wave (v) of iii of 1 is
developing. If the presumption is correct, the pair will continue to
rise to the levels of 1.1495 – 1.1605. The level of 1.1180 is critical
in this scenario. Its breakout will allow the pair to continue falling
to the levels of 1.1095 – 1.1019.
