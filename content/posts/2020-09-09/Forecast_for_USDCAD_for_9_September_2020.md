Forecast for USD/CAD: Will the Bank of Canada leave the pack?Dmitri
Demidenko

## Fundamental forecast for the Canadian dollar for today

### Form positions in USD/CAD based on the results of the Bank of
Canada's meeting

Central banks aren’t lone wolves. They move with a pack, and it’s hard
for an individual to forge ahead and cover a significant distance alone.
After the Fed started its [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of average inflation targeting, which
means the funds rate will be close to zero for a long time, the market
wondered what the others will do. The [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s can count on the Bank of
Canada’s and ECB’s dove rhetoric, or else the loonie and the euro may be
expected to consolidate, which is not desirable against a backdrop of
deflation processes that are taking place in Canada and the eurozone.

The Canadian dollar is a rare guest in LiteForex’s blog. Last time, I
recommended selling [USD/CAD][1] at the breakout of the support level of
1.385 [in May][2]. Since then, the pair had been constantly falling and
managed to drop below 1.3, but oil correction and revival of interest in
the greenback allowed the bulls to  start a counter-attack. Ahead of the
Bank of Canada’s meeting, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are wondering if the Central bank
will confirm a faster-than-expected economic recovery or will prefer
speaking about a long way of GDP’s returning to the trend.

Governor of the Bank of Canada Tiff Macklem promised in July to hold the
overnight rate at 0.25% for at least two years and buy at least CA$5
billion per week in government bonds under the QE program. As a result,
the Bank of Canada’s balance grew to CA$540 billion, whereas rumour has
it at Forex that QE is getting too aggressive, and maintaining it may
lead to a serious market distortion.

### Bank of Canada’s balance dynamics

Canada’s Q2 GDP drew down 38.7% y-o-y to CA$1.820 trillion, performing
worse than its US peer with a drawdown of 31.7%. One of the reasons for
Canada’s worse performance is a tougher lockdown. However, the final
numbers were better than the Bank of Canada’s forecast. June’s and
July’s data showed the economy had been recovering faster than expected.
According to BMO Capital Markets and Desjardins Securities, Canada will
return to the trend in Q3 faster than the US. The labour market’s fast
recovery proves that. Will Tiff Macklem and his colleagues admit that at
September’s meeting?

### Canada’s employment rate

I don’t think the central bank’s optimistic notes are appropriate in the
current situation. The 10% consolidation of the loonie against the USD
creates trouble for Canada’s export-oriented economy, while falling oil
prices harm its industrial sector amid China’s fading demand.  One needs
to be a dove in these circumstances, and it will increase the risk of
[USD/CAD][1]’s further correction.

At the same time, the global economy’s recovery will allow the black
gold to catch its breath, while the greenback’s long-term prospects can
hardly be called “bullish” against a backdrop of the Fed’s low rates.
Thus, sell the pair if it pulls back from resistance at 1.332 and 1.341,
or falls below support at 1.313.
