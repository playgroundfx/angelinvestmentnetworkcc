EUR/USD forecast: Dollar goes aheadDmitri Demidenko

## Fundamental US dollar forecast for today

### EUR/USD slides down not only because the ECB is expected to sound
dovish

The [EUR/USD][1] is running down, as the global risk appetite declines,
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s worry about a no-deal Brexit, and the safe-have demand is
increasing. The 10-year Treasury yield has had the worst [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) drop over
a month. It took the [Nasdaq Composite][2] only three days to enter the
correction territory, which means a 10% decline in the stock index from
the levels of recent [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) highs. The equities of US tech companies
have crashed, as many analysts suggest that the market has been
overvalued during the pandemic. The safe-havens, Treasuries, the yen,
and the greenback are the beneficiaries.

The growing demand for the US Treasuries is also supported by the
concerns that the correction of the US stock market will make businesses
postpone plans for a large-scale issue of corporate bonds. In August,
there were issued $108 billion in corporate bonds, which is an all-time
high. The demand for corporate bonds encouraged asset managers to sell
off Treasuries, which increased the yields. In September, the process
has reversed.

The euro is also down amid the information published by Financial Times
about the UK plans to override the agreement with the EU signed last
year. It is said that the UK will release the [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) on the change in the
internal market legislation. According to the bill, the UK doesn’t have
to notify the EU about the state aid, and the completion of the customs
declarations at the Irish border would be optional. The risk of a no-
deal V\Brexit has soared, and the pound crashed, being followed by the
euro.

### Dynamics of euro and pound

The correction of the US stock indices, the rise of the safe-haven
demand, and the concerns about the UK withdrawal from the EU without a
deal accelerate the [EUR/USD][1] drawdown, resulted from the
expectations for the ECB dovish tone. Investors see that the ECB, unlike
the Fed, failed to improve the financial conditions, which can affect
the future economic data. The US domestic data are likely to be better
than those of the euro-area in the near future. So, the euro won’t be
able to use such a growth driver as the divergence in the economic
expansion.

Furthermore, markets worry about the second wave of the COVID-19
pandemic in Europe and the problems of the euro-area exports. So, the
euro drawdown looks natural. In July, German exports of goods and
services to China contracted by 0.1%; to the USA -by 17%; to the UK -by
12.6%; to other EU countries – by 9.6% on an annual basis.

Rabobank suggests the [EUR/USD][1] could drop to 1.7 in September.
Capital Economics claims the correction of the US stock market won’t
last long. The stock indexes should resume growing as the global economy
is recovering. I agree with these viewpoints. The euro correction could
get deeper, but it is just a correction to the uptrend, which gives a
chance to buy the pair cheaper.
