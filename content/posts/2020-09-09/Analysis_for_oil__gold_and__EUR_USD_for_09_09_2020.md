Oil price yesterday reached the key support of the middle-term uptrend

The short-term trend is down. Yesterday, the main scenario to sell down
to the lower Target Zone [37.34 - 36.72]. I recommend exiting all sell
trades as there could start a correction up.

If the correction starts, we shall enter new sell trades according to
the patterns in the strong resistance zones. The strong resistances are
now Additional Zone [37.73 - 37.58] and Intermediary Zone [39.44 –
39.13]. The sell target will be the local low.

##  **Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis**

The gold price broke out the triangle downside. The price consolidated
below the support. Now, we expect the price to continue falling with the
first target at the low of August of 26, and next, the low of August 12.

According to the margin zones, if traders consolidate the price below
Target Zone [1922.4 - 1913.1], the target will be in Target Zone 2
[1829.4 — 1820.1].

Yesterday, the gold price didn’t reach Target Zone [1899.4 – 1890.1]. It
was corrected up to the first resistance zone [1932.1 – 1929.8]. I
suggest entering sell trades in this zone today.

If the gold price breaks out the resistance, the price should be further
corrected up to Intermediary Zone [1957.7 – 1953.0]. When IZ is reached,
I will also recommend entering sell trades.

It will be relevant to buy gold if the short-term trend turns up. It
will occur if the price breaks out IZ and the US session closes it above
the zone.

##  **Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis**

Euro bears are trying to break down the middle-term uptrend. The trend
will turn down when two US sessions close below Target Zone [1.1811 –
1.1791]. Yesterday, the first US session closed the price below TZ. We
shall see if the traders hold the price below the support today.

In the shorter timeframe, the EUR/USD is trading in the short-term
downtrend. Traders worked out the main scenario to sell, the price broke
through the low of September 4.

The US session closed below Target Zone [1.1811 - 1.1791]. It means that
the next downside target is Gold Zone [1.1711 — 1.1701].

I recommend entering new sell trades on the correction to the new
resistance zones, Additional Zone [1.1812 - 1.1807] and Intermediary
Zone [1.1867 — 1.1857].
