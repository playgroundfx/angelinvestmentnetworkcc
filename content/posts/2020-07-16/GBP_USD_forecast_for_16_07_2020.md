GBP/USD forecast: Pound caught the wind of changeDmitri Demidenko

## Fundamental Pound forecast for today

### Global risk appetite is no longer the main driver of the GBP/USD

For a long time, amid its high volatility, the GBP depended on the
changes in the global risk appetite, behaving like an emerging market’s
currency. Nonetheless, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s have now changed their point of view,
as financial markets are stabilizing, and it is clear that the peak of
the global economic recession has been over. Now, the major forex driver
is the speed of the recovery trend in a particular country, which is
greatly determined by the epidemiological situation. And the
epidemiological situation is difficult in the UK.

The UK is likely to be among the European countries worst affected by
COVID-19. About 300,000 coronavirus cases and 45,000 deaths, a late
strict lockdown made the OECD forecast the UK GDP drop by 11.5% in 2020,
which is the worst downturn for the advanced economies. Some
improvements in the data on the UK retail sales, PMI, and inflation
allowed the BoE Chief Economist Andy Haldane to suggest that the UK GDP
should rebound sooner than it was earlier expected. It encouraged the
[GBP/USD][1] bulls to draw the price to the top of figure 26. However,
the success of the sterling buyers has not lasted for long.

The UK GDP report for May showed that the economy expanded by only 1.8%,
instead of 5.5% expected by Reuters experts. It prompts that it will
take a longer time for the UK GDP rate to return to the trend. The
derivatives market expects the BoE will cut the interest rate below zero
by March 2022. Economists polled by Bloomberg forecast the QE expansion
by £50 billion through the end of 2020. The MPC Member Silvana Tenreyro
says she is willing to vote for the further measures to support the UK
economic recovery.

The head of the Bank of England Andrew Bailey supports this idea, saying
that the central bank will do its best to support the UK GDP growth, and
the interest rates should be kept low for a long time.

The pound is weakened because of several fundamental factors. The MPC
members sound dovish, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are disappointed as the UK economy fails
to rebound quickly and shift their focus from the risk appetite to the
divergence in the GDP growth. Furthermore, the Brexit issue has not been
solved, and the breakup in trade relations with the EU will worsen the
UK economic state that is already weak. The UK growth, according to
Bloomberg is recovering, slower than that of other European countries.
It suggests reasons to buy the [EUR/GBP][3] with targets at 0.925 and
0.94.

I expect the [GBP/USD][1] to consolidate in the trading range of
1.24-1.27. The pair should be responsive to the economic reports in the
UK and the USA, as well as the [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) about Brexit. The epidemiological
situation in the USA is worse than in the euro area. Besides, the US
dollar long-term outlook is bearish. So, the [GBP/USD][1] uptrend could
yet recover. Nonetheless, the sterling must have a fresh driver to go up
form the trading range.
