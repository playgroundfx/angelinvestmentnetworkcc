Dollar: better sooner than later. Forecast as of 24.06.2021Dmitri
Demidenko

As expected, the EURUSD is swinging up and down this week. Hawkish
comments by FOMC officials level positive euro-area PMI data. What's
next? Let us discuss the Forex outlook and make up a [EURUSD][1] trading
plan.

### Weekly US dollar fundamental forecast

Markets are growing on expectations of certain events, but if these
events have the opportunity to happen earlier than [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s expect,
markets will be shocked. Typical examples are the market reaction to the
earlier timeframes for the federal funds rate hike, which is expected in
2023, earlier than the previous forecast of 2024, and the [EURUSD][2]
drop against the backdrop of hawkish comments by FOMC members.

Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan said that given the significant
progress in the economy, Fed would start tapering its asset purchases
sooner than people think. He expects an interest-rate increase in 2022,
declining to elaborate on his 2023 rate projection. Fed President
Raphael Bostic expects one rate hike next year and two more ones in
2023. Amid such hawkish speeches of Fed’s officials, [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)-sensitive
two-year Treasury yield continued rallying up, encouraging the
[EURUSD][2] to regain the losses resulting from the euro-area PMI data.

In June, euro-area composite PMI featured the best growth in the past
fifteen years, as businesses make titanic efforts to meet growing demand
and the services sector is experiencing a surge of optimism over the
lifting of restrictions and the return of Europeans to normal life.

### Dynamics of euro-area PMI

Positive change in the euro-area PMI allows Bloomberg experts to predict
a quarterly expansion of the euro-area GDP by 1.2%. ECB Vice President
Luis de Guindos says that the currency bloc will feature significant
economic growth during the rest of the year, encouraging the [EURUSD][2]
bulls to go ahead. At the same time, the US manufacturing PMI in June
hit its highest point since the records began in 2007, and services PMI,
although being a little down, is still near its all-time highs. The US
economy is currently only 3.5% below trend and is rapidly catching up,
while the euro-area GDP deviation from the trend was 7% in the first
quarter.

Based on such concepts as divergence in economic growth and monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), it might seem that the [EURUSD][2] bulls have no chance.
Moreover, Christine Lagarde seems to have adopted the tactics of her
predecessor, Mario Draghi, to discourage the ECB hawks. Besides, the US
inflation could provide more surprises.

### Weekly [EURUSD][2] trading plan

On June 25, the US PCE will be published, the data being closely
monitored by the Fed. If the US inflation rises from 3.6% to 4.2%, the
Fed will be more likely to raise the rates in 2022. Furthermore, six
FOMC members, including New York Fed chief John Williams, are to speak
on June 24. Their dovish stance could support the euro. If the
[EURUSD][2] bulls fail to consolidate the price above 1.1945 in the near
future, bears will control the market.
