Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 24.06.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

The XRPUSD market is trading in a bullish trend. Therefore, the Ripple
price should be rising.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

The BTCUSD market is forming an impulse down wave (A) composed of five
sub-waves 1-2-3-4-5. The long-term corrective wave 4 has recently
completed as a double zigzag [W]-[X]-[Y]. The Bitcoin price is declining
in the bearish wave 5, unfolding as a simple impulse composed of five
sub-waves [1]-[2]-[3]-[4]-[5]. The first four parts of this formation
have completed. The market should be declining in wave [5] to a level of
26060. At this level, wave 5 will be 50% of wave 3.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Sell 32654.00, TP 26060.00

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

The XRPUSD market must have finished forming the down impulse wave C,
composed of sub-waves [1]-[2]-[3]-[4]-[5]. If the presumption is
correct, the beginning part of the new bull trend must be developing in
the most recent chart section. The market is forming impulse
(1)-(2)-(3)-(4)-(5), where two small sub-waves (1) and (2) have already
finished, and the upward impulse wave (3) is currently unfolding. Wave
(3) should end at a level of 0.783, where correction 4 completed.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] **** today:

Buy 0.627, TP 0.783

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

The descending impulse wave A continues forming. It is composed of sub-
waves [1]-[2]-[3]-[4]-[5]. The chart displays the final leg of impulse
[3]. The corrective wave [4] has also completed. There is developing the
bearish wave [5], namely, its final leg, sub-wave (5). The Ethereum
price should go down to a level of 1700.00. Earlier, sub-waves (3) and
[3] completed at this level.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Sell 1902.44, TP 1700.00
