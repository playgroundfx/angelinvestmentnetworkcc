## Forex now is a blatant reflection of US stock market

Every Forex trader must be able to the changing market conditions.
Analysts are puzzled as forex rates follow stocks rather than economic
fundamentals. Over the decades, forex experts predicted the future
trends of the currencies based on the interest rates. The better looked
interest rates, the higher could the local currency grow. Now,
everything has turned upside down. The GBP is going up amid the growing
risk of a no-deal Brexit, the AUD, being rather responsive to the
deterioration of the foreign trade, seems to be one of the best-
performing currency. The strategists call the current conditions
abnormal and put the responsibility on the Fed that has flooded the
markets with cheap liquidity.

According to BofA Merrill Lynch's research, the negative correlation
between the S&P 500 and the U.S. dollar has reached the highest value
over the past 15 years, turning currency pairs into a “blatant
reflection” of US stock markets. Such close ties were short-lived in the
past. Last time, this was happening for two weeks in August 2014, and
before that, it occurred in September 2009.

My analytics is more flexible. Back in early spring, I stressed the
correlation between the greenback and the US stock market amid a sharp
cut of the federal funds rate. The Fed turned the dollar into a major
safe-haven asset. This, amid the high sensitivity of [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s to the
risk appetite, made the USD and the S&P 500 be moving in the opposite
directions.

Nowadays, the buyers of the equities start realizing that they may have
gone too far. They used to bet on the huge monetary and fiscal stimulus,
the V-shaped recovery of the US economy, and a soon victory of the
coronavirus. However, the Fed can hardly do more than it has already
done, Republicans and Democrats can’t find a compromise on the further
assistance to the economy. Besides, the second wave of COVID-19 in China
and the disease peaks in some US states encourage [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s to sell the
S&P 500. Especially since Jerome Powell suggests a slow and painful
recovery of the US GDP pace.

A correction in the US stock market may lure [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s back to the
dollar, which has been more sold than bought in recent times. This is
evident from the demand for put and call [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/).

The balance of powers in Forex can also be affected by trade wars that
will influence the global risk appetite. According to the US Treasury
Secretary Steven Mnuchin, the US-EU negotiations on digital tax stalled,
and Washington can introduce new tariffs against the EU. On the other
hand, The U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, says the US has
an excellent agreement with China, which in spite of COVID-19, will
fulfill its commitments.

I would like to believe in a soon improvement of the epidemiological
situation and the end of the S&P 500 correction. This will allow the
[EUR/USD][3] bulls to hold up the support at 1.122-1.124. If the support
is broken out downside, traders are likely to sell the euro in the short
term.
