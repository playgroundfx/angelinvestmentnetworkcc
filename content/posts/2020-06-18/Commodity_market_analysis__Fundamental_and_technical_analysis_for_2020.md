## Commodity market and S&P GSCI: Fundamental and technical analysis

To be honest, the commodity market isn’t on my list of favourite trading
tools, but the current economic situation gives to this sector extra
drive and makes it attractive for short-term high-yield trades. The oil
market alone provides a perfect chance of earning from the panicky fall.

analysis  for 2020][1]

In March, I made a [forecast][2] for “black gold”, predicting a further
fall with a fast subsequent rebound.  ![LiteForex: Commodity market
analysis. Fundamental and technical analysis  for 2020][3]

Our expectations have been rewarded. The minimum point was determined
with 1-week accuracy and I congratulate those who caught that movement.
Thanks God, there are plenty of opportunities for everyone in the
commodity market now. At [LiteForex][4] , you can register and start
trading within a few minutes, for example.

The targets marked by wave (b) in the chart above look questionable at
the moment. A more detailed analysis of oil and gold will be provided in
my next article. Subscribe and keep in touch!

Today, I’d like to examine the commodity market index because
understanding the global market state is key to estimating its separate
elements.

 **Fundamental analysis of commodity market**

You may have heard that the Fed’s soft monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) and zero rates
will proceed till the end of 2022 at least. The Fed chair himself
announced that at the latest meeting. Many economists share the idea
that this [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) will last much longer because a future rate rise may
cost more to the economy than the advantages that the US is enjoying now
when the rates have been zeroed.  First of all, it’s connected with the
debt bubble. With zero rates, servicing the debt is almost free of
charge. Its sizes are limited only by demand for US bonds, in essence.

So, a big volume of cheap money appeared in the market. This speeds
prices up artificially and the commodity market is concerned too.
However, the real economy is still in trouble.

![LiteForex: Commodity market analysis. Fundamental and technical
analysis  for 2020][5]

Look at the US industrial production index in the chart above. The
current index is comparable with the 2008 crisis value. The difference
is that the collapse happened as fast as within 3 months (March, April,
May) and speaking of a reversal or a bottom is too early. So, the
current commodity market situation is contradictory: the real demand has
fallen but the prices have grown. Economists call this situation
“stagflation”.

In the short term, this situation may delay an economic crush at the
expense of the real sector. On the one hand, the real sector suffers
from a slump in demand and profits. On the other hand, it has to buy
resources and goods at a higher price. Eventually, this may grow into a
much deeper crisis or make an economy stagnate, at least. Stagflation
ruins a “sanitary” function of a crisis that consists in removing
inefficient and unpopular goods and services from the market and
replacing them with new productive companies.

![LiteForex: Commodity market analysis. Fundamental and technical
analysis  for 2020][6]

This situation has already happened before. The USA had it in the 60ies
(check the chart above) when the economy started sinking into a
recession. Back then, they managed to avoid a large crisis through
increasing the government debt and subsidies, but the price they paid
was an economic stagnation that lasted 15 years. The situation improved
only with the development of dotcom companies, which changed radically
many business processes and cut transaction expenses.

Japan’s economy is in a similar situation. The country got hooked on low
interest rates and is still unable to return to the precrisis levels of
the late 80ies.

![LiteForex: Commodity market analysis. Fundamental and technical
analysis  for 2020][7]

The Nikkie 225 index is floundering in a trading range and hardly
reached the level of the mid-nineties. More details on Japan were given
[here][8]. Let me remind you that the Japanese themselves called that
situation “the Lost 10 Years”. Basically, the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of pumping an
economy with cheap money looks like freezing a terminal patient until a
curing technology has been invented.  In our case, such a cure may be
another scientific and technological revolution that will restructure
the global economy, like Internet did some time ago. While waiting for
it, get prepared for another 10 lost years.

 **Technical analysis of commodity market**

The commodity index  S&P GSCI visualizes the commodity market state the
best.

![LiteForex: Commodity market analysis. Fundamental and technical
analysis  for 2020][9]

The chart above shows almost the whole [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) of  S&P GSCI’s evolution.
The index is in a bearish correction now, on the whole. The bullish
trend ended in late 2008 and then the deepest ever fall occurred. A
bullish wave formed in 2009, but there was no full recovery. Globally,
the correction looks like three zigzags forming inside a large
descending triangle.  The level of 216.9 is a strong support level
marked as a green line. It coincides with the start of a strong bullish
impulse formed at the beginning of the year 2003. As a result of April’s
fall, this level was tested but remained unbroken. So we may suppose
that it will be retested. This indirectly confirms the hypothesis of the
third zigzag’s formation. Its beginning will be located near the upper
edge of the triangle and wave (C) with a retest of the above mentioned
level.![LiteForex: Commodity market analysis. Fundamental and technical
analysis  for 2020][10]

When zooming in, we may notice an active bullish correction on the
1-month time frame. Most likely, it will be zigzag-shaped too. The  [ TM
annual candlestick’s projection][11] is located much higher than the
current index position, which points to its strong oversoldness.  Most
likely, an attempt to return to the candlestick’s lower limits at around
381 at least will have been made by the end of the year. The 1st level
support for the pivot point indicator is located there too. In our case,
it will provoke resistance when approaching it from below.

 **Conclusion**

Pumped with cheap liquidity, the commodity market may grow slowly in a
limited range, in general.  Most likely, neither 2020 nor 2021 results
won’t allow reaching the precrisis levels amidst bad macroeconomic
indicators. The triangle pattern makes me think the stagnation will last
until 2024 at the very least.

![LiteForex: Commodity market analysis. Fundamental and technical
analysis  for 2020][12]

Speaking about the closest time period, a bullish correction reached the
lower level of S3 support on the weekly chart and is now forming a
retracement. It may develop into a correction of wave (b) of the green
zigzag with a target at 286 in the chart above . We will have a long
sideways trend at best. Anyway, anyone who is holding long positions in
any commodities has to be careful now and protect themselves through
preventative measures.  Check my next article for a detailed review of
oil and gold compared with the general market index.
