## Simple forex strategies for [beginners](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-for-beginners/) to trade breakouts and price
pull-backs

 _Forex strategies to trade breakouts for newbies: trading with channel
indicators, spotting channel breakout or the price rebound. Types of
levels, rules for entering and exiting a trade._

I welcome readers to our trading blog. Today, I’d like to write about
the beginner [trading strategies](https://www.fintechee.com/forex-trading-strategies/) that use channel indicators, which are
always treated as a separate category. Such simple Forex trading
strategies suggest entering a trade at the time of the channel breakout
or the price rebound. Trading skills here are necessary to distinguish
between the correction or the inertial price movement and the major
trend direction. From this article, you will learn about price levels
and simple forex strategies that work, based on them; you will also
learn forex strategies that apply combined indicators.

## Breakout [trading strategies](https://www.fintechee.com/forex-trading-strategies/) for [beginners](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-for-beginners/)

Any [Forex trading](https://www.fintechee.com/forex-trading-strategies/) strategy for [beginners](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-for-beginners/) is made based on a particular
regularity. It doesn’t matter if it is about fundamental or technical
factors. An example would be entering a trade after certain events ([news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/)
publications) or when any indicators meet with each other. A separate
group includes strategies built on the breakout of any important level
or channel. Another way to interpret such kind of strategies is when the
price returns in the channel after the rebound from its border or the
rebound from the important level. The difficulty in trading with such
strategies is to find out whether the price will break out the level or
it will reverse. I will describe the important trading levels and give
examples of real strategies with channel indicators.

> Soon, you will have to make your own strategy (based on the features
of the trading platform you like best). It doesn’t matter whether it be
a trading range (price range), a moving averages-based strategy based
entirely on technical analysis or a price action strategy. Before you
become a forex trader with your own trading style it’s better to try
every other style there is to know the difference and find the one that
suits you best.

### Trading levels and level-based forex strategy

The psychology of forex level and channel strategies is that traders
behave in the same way in particular situations, and trading together
with the majority is often quite efficient. The psychology principle is
as follows:

  * Each trader expects a particular target profit and each trader has his/her own risk limit. It is expressed in the fact that traders put stop losses and take profits at particular levels and these levels are the same for the majority. This is how strong support and resistance levels appear. Support is the level, below which don’t let the price fall; resistance is the level, above which bear don’t let the price grow. The strategy is based on that you enter a trade in the opposite direction when the price reaches the level, that is, you open a position on the price pull-back in the direction of the reversal.

  * The level breakout means that there has been come fundamental factors that encouraged most traders to open positions even when the price reaches the psychological level. It means that if there price hasn’t rebounded, a strong trend appears.

Both trading ideas are well illustrated in the chart of market
capitalization.

The price has been trading between levels 200 and 250 during a month.
Although the price hasn’t touched the channel borders, it is clear how
it is rather smoothly moving from the bottom border to the top one and
back. Arrows mark the moments of entering trades (the price chart of top
cryptocurrencies corresponds to the market cap chart). Following the
breakout of level 200, the price touches the next psychological value of
175 and follows by trading in a narrow range for a while. The second
yellow circle highlights the new breakout and the start of a strong
downtrend.

The difficulty of trading is to find out whether it is the breakout or
the price is moving on by inertia and is about to reverse. So, there are
a few tips to spot it when a breakout occurs::

  * Do be too early to enter a trade in the opposite direction if the price has touched the target level. Expect either a reversal or the movement continuation, followed by a correction.

  * Do not open a trade too early if the price has reversed without touching the level. It may not be a reversal, it may be rather a temporary rollback, after which the price will resume the major trend.

  * Pay attention to the trend features and its angle the angle of its movement. If the angle was narrow for a long time, after which there was a sharp change, this is a signal to enter a trade. An example of such a situation is on the figure above (the first yellow circle).

Types of Forex levels:

  * Fibonacci levels. It is an infinite series of numbers, based on mathematical approach. As experience proves, traders adhere to these levels intuitively. You can learn more about their nature and applications in [this article][2]. You can calculate Fibonacci levels, using [calculator][3].

  * Psychological levels. These are levels that are based on human psychology, often being chosen intuitively. For example, they are often at round numbers.

  * Historical levels. They are strong levels that are regularly hit by the price, they are clear in the long time periods.

  * Mirror levels. They are the levels, which the price breaks through, returns to them after the correction and again goes in the main trend. The resistance level thus turns into a support level.

  * Pivot levels. They are the levels, drawn based on the [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) opening and closing prices. I will describe them in more detail in one of the strategies below.

Channels (dynamic) levels are similar with the only difference that the
channel borders here look like flexible lines. There are many channel
indicators and none of them can be said to be more or less accurate.
Much depends on a particular market situation. I will give practical
examples of such indicators further. Let's see the 3 basic [Forex trading](https://www.fintechee.com/forex-trading-strategies/)
strategies for [beginners](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-for-beginners/):

## 1\. Basic forex strategy: Dynamic Channel Trading

This trading system applies the Keltner channel (KC) indicator, a
combined tool that constructs a dynamic price channel. It is based on
two standard tools:

The principle of the strategy is that in a quiet market, the price moves
inside the channel, taking its average values. When it deviates from the
average values (i.e., moves towards the borders), it tends to return.
The EUR/USD pair, traded in the M15 timeframe suits the indicator
settings the best. It is not recommended to shorten the timeframe; it
can be longer for other pairs if it provides more accurate signals.

KC settings: ЕМА period =20, ATR period ATR = 20, Factor = 1.5 (the
factor, by which the ATR value is multiplied). You can download its free
template for MT4 following [this link][4].

Requirements to open a long position:

  * One or more candlesticks go lower than the channel bottom border. But there shouldn’t be more than 7 of them, as, otherwise, it can be about the channel breakout and the start of a new strong trend. The candlesticks must be located completely below the channel line.

  * The distance between the dynamic line and the high of the candlestick below it must be longer than 5 pips.

  * After all these requirements are met, a rising candlestick is emerging in the chart, which closes above the dynamic line. Differently put, the price has reversed and is going back to the channel centre. The longer is the body, the better.

You enter a trade at the next candlestick. A protective order is put at
a distance of 15-30 pips. I recommend exiting the trade after the price
has reached the channel centre. You may close 50% of the position, and
protect the rest of it by trailing stop, having moved the stop loss at
the breakeven.

### Requirements to enter a short trade:

  * One or more candlesticks go higher than the channel top border. But there shouldn’t be more than 7 of them. The candlesticks must be located completely above the channel line.

  * The distance between the top dynamic line and the low of the candlestick above it must be longer than 5 pips.

  * After all these requirements are met, a falling candlestick is emerging in the chart, which closes below the dynamic line. Differently put, the price has reversed and is going down to the channel centre. The longer is the body, the better.

The entry and exit requirements are similar. An additional confirming
signal can be a candlestick reversal pattern, formed beyond the channel.

The indicator performs the best during classical market movements, that
is, in a calm market. Trading is avoided at the time of [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) releases,
as there are many false signals (false breakouts) during increased
volatility. You had better also avoid trading flat and the Asian
session. If the channel looks narrow, compared to the previous periods,
you shouldn’t also enter a trade. You neither enter a trade if the
signal candlestick looks too long, i.e. it has reached or is near the
channel centre.

## 2\. Trading strategy: Pivot levels breakout

This strategy utilizes a channel indicator that constructs Pivot levels,
W1 Pivot. The indicator paints in the chart weekly support and
resistance levels, at the breakout of which you can make profits.

First, let me specify what Pivot points are. A candlestick has a body
and shadows. Shadows are the price highs and lows during a time period;
the extreme values of the body are the opening and the closing prices.
Pivot levels are the price reversal levels that are calculated according
to the following formula:

  * R1 (resistance line) = (Price*2) - min.

  * R2 = Price + max - min.

  * R3 = max + 2*(Price - min).

  * S1 (support line) = (Price*2) - max.

  * R2 = Price - max + min.

  * R3 = min - 2*( max - Price)

Price is the reference levels that is calculated like this:
(max+min+close)/3, where max is the highest price during a particular
period, min is the lowest price, close is the closing price of the
candlestick. This calculation method is the classic one. There are
other, original variants, like Woodie, Camarilla, DeMark etc. I suggest
you test on your own which calculation method provides the most accurate
results. Please, do share your results in the comments!

You can download the W1 Pivot indicator [here][7]. The strategy is
suitable for any currency pair, the [best time](https://www.fixpro.org/post/forex-best-time-to-trade/)frame is H1. W1 Pivot
settings: fortsize = 10, labelShift = 0. However, the formulas are the
same and you can’t change them.

### Requirements for entering a trade in both directions:

  * You set a pending Sell Stop order at level R3 + 10-20 pips. For less volatile currencies, you set stop at a shorter distance.

  * You set a pending Buy Stop order at level S3 + 10-20 pips, according to the same principle.

It is important to choose the right distance for stop loss and pending
orders, they shouldn’t be triggered by volatility. A reference distance
for stop losses is about 30-50 pips, the target profit may put at the
same distance.

strategies for [beginners](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-for-beginners/)][8]

Although there are few losing trades, the signals are sent rather
rarely. That is why you’d better apply the strategy to multiple currency
pairs or use a complementary tool.

## 3\. Forex strategy: Trading Dynamic Trend

It is a simple strategy but a dynamic one. It keeps the trader on the
ropes. The matter is not just that you need to monitor the trades and
the signals all the time; it is rather that it sends quite many false
signals. But a few profitable trades are sufficient to cover the loss
and gain. High-frequency trading gets use of probability law: you may
enter one trade per day and get 100% of loss; but you can enter two
trades and only 50% of them are losing. The more signals, the higher is
the success chance.

The Dynamic Trend indicator, utilized in the strategy, paints dynamic
levels, levels that are constantly changing, following the price. Trades
are entered almost all the time wit ha turnover. The currency pair is
EUR/USD, the timeframe is H1, but you may try changing it to M30. The
indicator settings are Percent = 15 (the percentage of the indicator
deviation), MaxPeriod = 50 (calculation period). You can download it
[here][9].

### Requirements for opening a long position:

You put an entry at the candlestick, following the signal one; stop loss
is at a distance of 50-100 pips. After the trade has yielded 50 pips of
profit, you close one third of the position; after there are 100 pips of
profit you close another third and protect the rest with a trailing
stop. If the candlestick goes below

strategies for [beginners](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-for-beginners/)][10]

Requirements for opening a short position:

You open a position in a similar way. The trader needs fast response to
the trade reversal in case of an error. However, you also need to keep
in mind that the price may change its direction due to a correction;
long stop losses in this case are a risk for the trader. You may adjust
the rules for exiting the trade or change the currency pair. You may
also draw the trailing stop manually, although it will distract you
monitoring the trades entered. I offer curios traders to compare this
level indicator with other channel indicators, attaching, for example,
Bollinger bands. I don’t think it makes any sense to add oscillators.

## Let’s sum up the information about channel [trading strategies](https://www.fintechee.com/forex-trading-strategies/)

Trading channels is useful because channel strategies have a clear way
of application. The trader needs to select the right indicator, currency
pair, timeframe and a good moment. Some tips on this:

  * Strategies of such type require constant monitoring. So, be prepared to spend quite much time on this.

  * Avoid trading at the time of economic data releases, during the first two hours of Monday mad the last two hours of Friday. Exit all trades before the weekend.

  * Do not try to open as many positions as possible, you’d better follow the rule that it is better to enter fewer traders but enter better ones.

  * Train yourself to “feel” the market. It is very seldom when all the conditions, price lines, and indicators signal the same; so, it is important to take a reasonable risk.

There are no perfect [trading strategies](https://www.fintechee.com/forex-trading-strategies/); rather, there is a good
combination of the market conditions, [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) and indicators. And, of
course, you won’t succeed without professional experience. The more you
learn different kinds of trading tools and the more you experiment with
them, the more you improve your intuition. Therefore, I recommend you to
learn about as many new indicators as you can, test them and gain
experience on demo accounts and don’t be afraid of risk. I wish you
successful trading and share the article with your friends! I am really
looking forward to your comments, notes, ideas, and tips in the
comments! Buy and sell and make profits!
