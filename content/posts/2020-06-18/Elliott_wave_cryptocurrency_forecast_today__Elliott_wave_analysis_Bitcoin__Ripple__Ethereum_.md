Corrective wave [4] has completed as a skewed triangle
(A)-(B)-(C)-(D)-(E) within the global impulse wave A. There is likely to
be forming the initial phase of the final wave [5]that may complete as a
simple bullish impulse wave. The sub-waves (1) and (2) look complete, so
the price should be rising in impulse (3). The entire wave [5] may
complete at a level of around 10800. An approximate trajectory of the
Bitcoin future price movement is outlined in the chart.

The long-term corrective wave (B) is likely to have completed, it
started developing in late April 2020. The (B) correction is a bearish
double zigzag, where zigzags W and Y are connected with the upward
linking wave X that is a double zigzag. The XRPUSD market is now forming
the initial part of the new trend. The small sub-waves 1 and 2 are
likely to have completed, so, the price should be rising in the impulse
wave 3.

The ETHUSD chart shows the structure of the upward impulse wave A, where
sub-waves [1]-[2]-[3]-[4] have completed, and the final wave [5] is now
developing as a five-wave impulse. There has recently completed the down
corrective wave (4) that is composed of sub-waves a-b-c, and the price
has started rising. There should be forming the initial segment of the
new impulse wave, where the first two sub-waves 1 and 2 have completed,
and the price is expected to be rising in the sub-wave 3. The entire
wave [5] should complete at a level of around 263.00, as it is outlined
