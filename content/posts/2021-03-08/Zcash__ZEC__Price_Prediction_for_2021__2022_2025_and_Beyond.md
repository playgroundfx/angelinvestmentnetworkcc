Zcash Predictions: Should You Invest in ZECJana Kane

Despite [regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/) restrictions, the popularity of cryptocurrencies has
been growing over the years. We all have heard about Bitcoin, Ethereum,
and Litecoin. Still, there are other digital assets that can provide
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s with exciting opportunities. ZEC is one of them.

Zcash is one of the most promising tokens with a high level of
anonymity. It's the first open-source digital asset based on a
[blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/). The coin appeared on October 28, 2016. Bitcoin’s framework
became a foundation for Zcash, which is why both coins have many things
in common. Still, their value differs significantly – BTC is near
$20,000, while ZEC is still below $100. What determines the price of
Zcash? How much will Zcash be worth?

Zcash price prediction is not an easy thing. In this guide, we will
consider not only [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) price movements but predictions of ZEC
analysts. To make your future investing more successful, we will
highlight factors that affect the coin's market price, so you will be
able to make your own Zcash price forecasts. Will the price of Zcash go
up? Let's find out!

The article covers the following subjects:

## Zcash: What Is Inside?

Before we consider price movements, let’s answer one simple question -
what is [Zcash][1]? Zcash or ZEC is a cryptocurrency built on a
decentralized [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) that includes open-source code. That is its
main similarity with Bitcoin. Another thing Zcash shares with BTC is the
cap. Both cryptocurrencies have a limited offer of 21 million units.

However, ZEC, as a privacy coin, takes further steps to protect its
users. The system was developed to provide users and their transactions
with anonymity. ZEC increases privacy by applying zero-knowledge proofs
(zk-SNARKs). It allows users to validate transactions without disclosure
of information that could affect the user's privacy. At the same time,
the ZEC coin has an exciting feature. It allows users to share address
and transaction information they can select to comply with audits and
[regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/)s.

According to its developers, ZEC is built on strong science. Let's talk
more about ZEC addresses. They are divided into two types:

Z-addresses are private, while t-addresses are considered transparent.
There are four transaction types between these kinds of addresses Two
address types are interconnected. You can transfer funds between both
address types. The only requirement is to be aware of the privacy
implications.

The key advantages of Zcash are low-rate transactions, the anonymity of
users and transactions, disclosure of payment data to a third party,
transaction expiration, and multiple signatures for transactions.

The main factor that contributed to the development of cryptocurrency is
privacy. ZEC submits a high degree of it and can be called a "leading
privacy" coin. Yet, this cryptocurrency hasn't reached the highs of BTC.
What is Zcash’s future? We’ll address that next.

## The Price History of ZEC: Focus on 2020

The development of Zcash dates back to the creation of ZeroCash
cryptographic protocol, which was supposed to become a supplement of
well-known Bitcoin. As the developers of Zerocash couldn't agree with
Bitcoin founders, a new cryptocurrency, Zcash, was formed.

This digital currency was supposed to keep the ideology of ZeroCash but
use a protocol separated from Bitcoin. On October 28, 2016, the new
Zcash cryptocurrency was officially released. The launch of the private
ZEC coin attracted a lot of attention. As a result, its price
skyrocketed to around $6,000. However, later it balanced in the area of
$40-70.

According to [Coinmarketcap][2], ZEC is the 35th largest cryptocurrency
worldwide. Still, despite its functionality, it's not among the 15
largest digital assets. In 2018, the price of ZEC was around $900. Since
2019, it has fluctuated within a narrow range of $30-$70. To understand
the reasons behind the low value of ZEC, let's consider [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) price
movements.

It's not a secret that the spikes in the price of cryptocurrencies
mostly occur due to upgrades in their [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) or because of
cooperation agreements. The same factors led to Zcash’s growth.

The first significant event happened in May 2017. Coin developers agreed
with JPMorgan to add privacy technology of Zcash to JPMorgan [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/)
platform. At that time, ZEC coin's capitalization and market value
reached the top and led the currency to the top-10 crypto assets. In
June 2017, ZEC traded near $400.

The all-around crypto popularity caused a further rise at the beginning
of 2018. The price was around $900. Later, the crypto boom effect calmed
down, and Zcash returned to its normal rate.

The next significant upward movement was in June 2018, when the price
climbed above $100. The rise could be caused just by the strength of
bulls who tried to push Zcash from its lowest level since 2017.

Later the price increased in February 2020. However, bulls were not
strong enough to keep the price at highs. As a result, ZEC plunged below
$25 in March 2017. In August 2020, Zcash was pushed to $100. Although
ZEC lost in value in September 2020, this surge helped the
cryptocurrency move from previous lows.

ZEC protocol went through a vast number of upgrades. Still, halving
became one of the most important events of 2020. Halving is a standard
procedure for cryptocurrencies. However, it has an impact on Zcash’s
future value for sure. On November 28, ZEC underwent halving. It meant
that the reward of ZEC miners was reduced twice from 6.25 to 3.125 ZEC
per block. As anticipated, the event caused a fall in price, but the
coin managed to recover quickly.

## Zcash Price Target for 2021: How High Can Zcash Go?

As you can notice, Zcash is highly volatile. It's not simple to predict
its value in advance. That's why it's worth checking Zcash forecasts of
crypto experts. We have gathered several opinions that will allow you to
formulate an outlook for 2021.

According to [WalletInvestor][3], Zcash is supposed to be a high-risk
investment opportunity. A 1-year projection is $55.304. The change will
amount to -22.968%.

[DigitalCoinPrice][4] agrees with WalletInvestor and doesn't predict
that ZEC will become expensive in 2021. The [website](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/website-for-forex-trading/) believes the
beginning of 2021 will be disappointing for the cryptocurrency as it
will sink to $7.36. The coin will get a chance to recover in the next
two months, but the roof will be set slightly above $50. By the end of
the year, the price will stay in the range of $30-40.

[CryptoGround.com][5] sees ZEC near $57 in 2021. It means that the
cryptocurrency will fall next year. Still, the longer-term ZEC price
prediction is shinier. Read on to know whether Zcash will cost $1000 in
the future.

[Previsioni Bitcoin][6] is among the few experts who believe in the
surge of ZEC in 2021. The platform sees Zcash at $576.79 in December
2021.

[TradingBeasts][7] says Zcash will be able to reach $90 by December
2021, while the minimum price will be slightly above $55 (January 2021).

## Technical Analysis of ZEC/USD: How High Will Zcash Go?

We start our [ZEC/US dollar][1] technical analysis with the H1 time
frame to determine the most stable market trends.

Look at the prediction chart below:

First, let's identify global trends and the key levels. The ZEC coin has
been updating its local highs and lows since March 2020. As a result,
the trend has been bullish in the last months. It's marked as a blue
line in the chart.

I marked important trade volume peaks as blue dots. Japanese
candlesticks located above them identify the key levels.

One of the important peaks formed as early as November 2017. The green
candle with the peak at around 375 marks it. The next moment of the
trading activity is April 2018. The low of that month's candle forms the
actual resistance level for the current price at 180 USD.

The chart also suggests that the [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) support level formed at 16.5
USD.

### Zcash price prediction for next three months

Next, let's continue our technical analysis on the [Zcash weekly
chart][1]. Note that the downward price movement on the last bars occurs
together with a steep increase in trading volumes. The price didn't
break the value of 180 USD, thus confirming the sellers' serious
intentions. At that level, draw the trend line projection, marking the
limits of a wide trading channel.

Also, the chart indicates that the last weekly candle looks like the
long-legged doji. So, there's a fierce fight between bulls and bears,
and a correction is very likely to occur. At the same time, if the price
consolidates above the level of 180 USD, the situation will take a
U-turn. The prospects of the Zcash projected growth to the value of 370
- 375 USD will be realistic.

Based on the trend channels and the Bollinger bands' width, the ZEC
price's likeliest outlook in the next three months will be a flat
movement between 100 dollars and 180 dollars, leading to a smooth
correction in general.

### Monthly Zcash price forecast for 2021

Here's the [Zcash][8] long-term technical analysis, a detailed forecast
for this year, and probable price targets. I plotted candlestick
projections for each month, based on the Bollinger bands width.

The likeliest scenario for up to October 2021 is that the latest upward
momentum will correct. A pullback from the nearest support level of 180
USD can confirm that. Future prices will most likely fluctuate in the
range of 60-120 dollars.

The general bullish trend will continue. Thus, from November 2021, we
can expect that the correction will end, and the cryptocurrency will
continue moving in an ascending channel. This year's target is to retest
the level of 180 USD.

## Weekly Elliott wave ZCash analysis as of 08.03.2021

The ZECUSD market is forming the global simple zigzag A-B-C. The [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/)
timeframe displays the final leg of the bullish impulse A and the

zigzag. In Spring 2020. the market has started rising in the upward
impulse wave. So far, there have complete the sub-waves [1] and [2], and
sub-wave (1) of a smaller degree. Let us examine the most recent chart
section in a shorter timeframe.

In late February 2021, the market has completed the upward wave (1) as a
five-wave impulse. Wave (1) is the first leg of a strong impulse [3].
This week, the ZEC price should be following the corrective wave (2),
which should end as a simple zigzag A-B-C, where wave B is also a zigzag
[A]-[B]-[C]. Correction [B] should be a small contracting triangle, upon
completion of which, the market will start growing in the [C] to a level
of 153.00. At the indicated level, wave B will be 61.8% of the bearish
impulse A.

## Zcash – Should You Buy or Sell in 2022?

Surprisingly, those experts who believe in the surge in 2021 see Zcash
declining a year later. In comparison, bearish analysts turn to become
bullish for 2022. Check the predictions.

  * Well, WalletInvestor analysts believe that ZEC will be going down in 2021, but does the cryptocurrency have chances in 2022? 2022 is expected to be promising for ZEC. The price may break above $500 in October-November 2022. During the year, the price is anticipated to fluctuate slightly above $300.

  * TradingBeasts see ZEC’s target around $110 by December 2022. The minimum price of $62.61 may occur at the beginning of the year. Although the minimum price is below the current price, it's still not an enormous risk for traders.

  * DigitalCoinPrice experts don't believe in the strength of Zcash in 2022. The price may decline to $28.76.

  * Previsioni Bitcoin is bearish about ZEC for 2022. The platform sees the crypto asset to fall as low as $290.89 in November 2022. The average price will amount to $450. You may be surprised we say that the price will fall. But don’t forget that the platform predicts ZEC above $500 in 2021. 

  * CryptoGround.com analysts tell their readers that the price of ZEC will be about $329. Considering its disappointing forecast for 2021, we can conclude that ZEC is a long-term investment that may require your patience and funds to hold positions open.

## Zcash Price Target in 2023: Still Any Hopes?

It becomes harder to predict the price of the cryptocurrency from a
long-term perspective. Still, analysts try to do that.

  * CryptoGround.com is among the few predictors who see the price of ZEC constantly rising. In 2023, the projected value of Zcash is supposed to increase to $436. 

  * Previsioni Bitcoin sees the lowest price of ZEC in May 2023 at $217. The crypto asset will fall in 2023. Still, the average rate is set at $280. 

  * According to DigitalCoinPrice, ZEC will equal $39.7 in 2023. It's much lower than predictions of other experts.

  * TradingBeasts experts are sure that ZEC's rise will occur only in December 2023, and then the price will be able to climb to $131. 

  * WalletInvestor considers a bullish opportunity for ZEC in 2023. The price is supposed to rise above $500 in June 2023. In October, ZEC will surge above $700. 

## Zcash Price Prediction From 2025-2030

Although many analysts make long-term ZEC predictions, you should know
they are approximate. As ZEC is one of the most volatile crypto assets,
it's hard to predict its price with a high degree of accuracy. To not be
fooled, we recommend applying fundamental and technical analysis and
reviewing your projections frequently.

Not all analysts are ready to provide such a long-term forecast.
DigitalCoinPrice sees that ZEC will rise above $100. Still, the increase
will be capped near $171 in 2026.

WalletInvestor offers the most exciting prediction. The service believes
ZEC will skyrocket above $1000 in 2025.

## How Has the Price of Zcash Changed Over Time?

Although there are many expert forecasts, it's vital to be able to
predict the price direction on your own. One of the most frequent
questions is, “why is Zcash going up?” Before you forecast a future
Zcash trend, look at the [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) price movement.

As you can see, the price can be at the beginning of the bullish trend.
However, further direction will highly depend on fundamental factors. If
you read our article carefully, you could notice that the price spikes
happened in times of important Zcash [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/). Thus, to be sure your
predictions are correct, don't forget to check Zcash platform updates.

Despite mixed forecasts, Zcash seems to be a good investment. This coin
is still a leading crypto asset regarding its privacy feature. It means
that it's unlikely the coin will disappear as other small
cryptocurrencies have done. If the developers come up with new ideas,
the currency will keep climbing.



Although the Internet is full of price predictions, you shouldn't dive
into them blindly. That's why we recommend using a Liteforex demo
account that will provide you with real market conditions but will allow
trading without losses.

If you don't try trading on [demo account][13] before entering the real
market, you risk losing a lot despite analysts' predictions. As you
could notice, ZEC is one of the most volatile crypto assets. The price
suffers significant spikes. Thus, the risks of mistakes increase
significantly, especially if you are a newbie trader.

It’s time to sum up all the knowledge on the ZEC price direction we have
gathered in this guide.
