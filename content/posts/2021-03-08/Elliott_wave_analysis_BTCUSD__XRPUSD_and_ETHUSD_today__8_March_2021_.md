Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 08.03.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

All the three cryptocurrency pairs covered in the article should be
growing in the impulse waves this week. Let us explore each
cryptocurrency market structure in more detail.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

There is forming the double down zigzag [W]-[X]-[Y], namely, its middle
part- the linking wave [X]. Wave [X] is unfolding as a simple zigzag
(A)-(B)-(C). The sub-waves (A) and (B) have completed, and the price is
rising in the impulse wave (C). The impulse wave (C) is composed of the
sub-waves 1-2-3-4-5, where the first three sub-waves must have
completed, and the bearish corrective sub-wave 4 is unfolding.
Therefore, there should be developing a short corrective wave 4 and the
final wave 5, driving the price to a level of 54500.00.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 50351.00, TP 54500.00

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

The XRPUSD is forming the down simple zigzag [A]-[B]-[C]. Within this
zigzag, there is forming corrective wave [B], which is composed of three
sub-waves (A)-(B)-(C). The (B) should end soon, and there will be
developing the upward impulse (C). The (C) impulse could drive the price
up to a level of 0.520, where the [B] correction will be 50% of the
impulse wave [A]. After the suggested target level is reached, the
Ripple price will start declining in the final wave [C] towards a level
of 0.300.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] today:

Buy 0.463, TP 0.520

## Elliott wave Ethereum analysis

The ETHUSD market continues forming the double downward zigzag W-X-Y.
Wave W has completed as a simple zigzag. There is now forming the upward
linking wave X as a zigzag. There have completed two sub-waves, impulse
[A] and correction [B]. There is now forming the fourth sub-wave of the
upward impulse [C]. The entire wave [C] could end at a level of around
1865.00.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Buy 1717.51, TP 1865.00
