Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 08.03.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

On Monday, oil opened with a gap which led to the Gold Zone [66.17 -
65.94] breakout.

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

On Monday, oil opened with a gap which led to the Gold Zone [66.17 -
65.94] breakout. Taking into account the short-term uptrend, there is a
possibility that Target Zone 2 [68.66 - 68.21] will be reached today or
tomorrow. Further growth will depend on the traders' ability to
consolidate above the level of 68.66.

If the price falls into a correction from the current levels, look for
purchases at strong supports: Additional Zone [66.71 - 66.60] and
Intermediary Zone [65.58 - 65.36], to update the day's high and reach
Target Zone 2.

At the moment, there is no reason for oil sales.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

  1. Buy according to the pattern in Additional Zone [66.71 - 66.60]. TakeProfit: 67.80, Target Zone 2 [68.66 - 68.21]. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. Buy according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone [65.58 - 65.36]. TakeProfit: 67.80, Target Zone 2 [68.66 - 68.21]. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

The short-term gold downtrend continues. Its target is Target Zone 2
[1675 - 1665]. Since Friday, the precious metal has been in correction
and reached the resistance zone [1718 - 1710]. While this zone is being
held, focus on looking for sales according to the pattern with the
target at Friday's low + TZ.

If the resistance level of 1718 is broken out, it will be possible to
consider purchases with a target at the trend border [1747 - 1742]. In
this case, a stop-loss order should be placed beyond level 1710.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

  1. Open sell positions according to the pattern in [1718 - 1710]. TakeProfit: 1688, Target Zone 2 [1675 - 1665]. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. If the price breaks out the level of [1718 - 1710], buy. TakeProfit: Intermediary Zone [1747 - 1742]. StopLoss: beyond the level of 1710.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

Last week, the EUR/USD pair reached another sales target within a short-
term downtrend. This target was Target Zone 2 [1.1922 - 1.1906]. Now the
bears are trying to break out the support. If successful, the next
target for the price fall will be Gold Zone 2 [1.1842 - 1.1834].

Because the test of the Additional Zone [1.1937 - 1.1933] took place on
Friday during Nonfarm Payrolls, it is reasonable to keep sales from this
zone today. The target is Friday's low.

The trend border is shifting to the [1.1981 - 1.1973] zone.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

  1. Hold sell trades entered in Additional Zone [1.1937 - 1.1933]. TakeProfit: 1.1895. StopLoss: at the breakeven.

  2. Sell according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone [1.1981 - 1.1973]. TakeProfit: 1.1895. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.
