Economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the week 28.09.2020 – 04.10.2020Jana Kane

##  **Review of the main events of the Forex economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the
next trading week (28.09.2020 – 04.10.2020)**

 **Trading on key Forex [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/): next week we expect the publication of
important macro statistics from Germany, China, Great Britain, Eurozone,
the US, Japan, and Australia.**

The dollar strengthened last week, while the DXY dollar index, which
reflects its value against a basket of 6 major currencies, rose 2.7%.

The Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, who spoke three times in Congress last
week, called on Congress to provide additional financial assistance to
citizens and businesses.

Powell said the recovery would be faster "if support comes from both
Congress and the Fed," urging the US government to increase government
spending to accelerate the economic recovery. He noted that although
"many economic indicators point to a visible improvement," "employment
and overall economic activity are still well below pre-crisis levels,"
and future prospects remain highly uncertain.

"Without fiscal support, improving the labor market will be much more
difficult and slower," said Charles Evans, President of the Federal
Reserve Bank of Chicago, last Wednesday.

Concerns about the economic recovery, the growing number of people
infected with coronavirus in the United States (last Friday the number
of cases was at 44,000), Europe and the world, which could provoke a new
wave of quarantine restrictions, as well as the inability of American
lawmakers to agree on another package of assistance to citizens and
businesses leads to a fall in stock indices and an increase in demand
for defensive assets.

While markets watch a growing number of new cases of Covid-19, and
Congress finds it difficult to agree on a new stimulus package, the
yield on 10-year US government bonds fell to 0.66% from 0.69% a week
ago, and the dollar added 2.7% in cost. And so far, this trend towards a
further decline in stock indices and the strengthening of the dollar
continues.

The focus of [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s next week will be on the publication of data from
the US labor market. Investors will also pay attention to the
publication of several important macro data from Germany, China, Great
Britain, Eurozone, the US, Japan, and Australia.

 **Traders should pay attention to the publication of the following
macro indicators:**

 ***during the coming week, new events may be added to the [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) and
/ or some scheduled events may be canceled**

 ****** **GMT time**

###  **Monday, September 28**

No important macro statistics planned to be released.

###  **Tuesday, September 29**

###  **12:00 EUR Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices  (HICP) in Germany
(preliminary release)**

This index is published by the EU Statistics Office and is calculated on
the basis of a statistical method agreed upon between all EU countries.
It is an indicator for assessing inflation and is used by the Governing
Council of the ECB to assess the level of price stability. A positive
result strengthens the EUR, a negative one weakens it.

In May, the HICP index (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) increased by +0.5%, in June by
+0.8%, in July - by 0%, in August it decreased by -0.1%. Preliminary
forecast for September: -0.2%. The euro is likely to react negatively to
the publication of this indicator. If the data turn out to be better
than the forecast, the euro may strengthen in the short term. The growth
of the indicator is a positive factor for the euro. The data indicate
that inflationary pressures are still low in Germany. The data worse
than the forecast and the previous value will negatively affect the
euro.

###  **Wednesday, September 30**

###  **01:00 CNY China's Manufacturing PMI from the China Federation of
Logistics and Purchasing (CFLP)**

This is an important indicator of the state of the Chinese economy as a
whole. A result above 50 is seen as positive and strengthens the CNY,
one below 50 as negative for the yuan. Forecast: 51.2 in September
(against 51.0 in August, 51.1 in July and 50.9 in June).

The relative growth of the index and the value of 50 should have a
positive effect on the CNY. Data above the value of 50 indicates an
increase in activity, which has a positive effect on the quotes of the
national currency.

In the opposite case, and if the indicator is below 50, the yuan will be
under pressure and probably will decrease.

###  **01:00 CNY China's Services PMI from the China Federation of
Logistics and Purchasing (CFLP)**

This indicator assesses the state of the services sector in the Chinese
economy. A result above 50 is considered positive and strengthens the
yuan. Forecast: 52.1 in September (against 55.2 in August, 54.2 in July
and 54.4 in June).

Despite the relative decline, the indicator is still above 50, which is
likely to have a positive impact on the yuan quotes.

###  **06:00 GBP UK Q2 GDP (Final Release)**

GDP is considered an indicator of the overall health of the British
economy. The upward trend in GDP is considered positive for the GBP. The
UK's GDP was one of the highest in the world until 2016, when the Brexit
referendum was held. Then its growth slowed down, and with the onset of
the global coronavirus pandemic, the growth rate of British GDP went
into negative territory.

The UK's annual GDP is forecast to decline by -20.4% in Q2 2020 (after 0
in Q4 2019 and a -2.2% drop in Q1 2020). The fall in GDP is a negative
factor for the GBP.

The main factors that can force the Bank of England to keep rates low
are weak GDP and labor market growth, as well as low consumer spending.
If the GDP data nevertheless coincide with the preliminary negative
estimate of -20.4%, it will put downward pressure on the pound. Strong
GDP report will strengthen the pound. But it can hardly be expected in
the current situation.

###  **06:00 EUR Retail sales in Germany**

Retail sales are the main consumer spending indicator in Germany showing
changes in retail sales. A high result strengthens the euro, and vice
versa, a low result weakens it. Forecast: +0.7% (+3.4% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/))
in August against -0.9% (+4.2% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) in July, -1.6% (+5.9% in
annualized) in June, +13.9% and +3.8% (annualized) in May.

The data suggests a slight improvement in sales in August, but this is
unlikely to have a strong positive effect on the euro, and if it does,
it will only be in the short term.

###  **09:00 EUR Consumer Price Index. Core Consumer Price Index
(Preliminary release)**

Consumer Price Index (CPI) is published by Eurostat and measures the
price change of a selected basket of goods and services over a given
period. The index is a key indicator for assessing inflation and
changing purchasing habits. A positive result strengthens the EUR, a
negative one weakens it. In January, the CPI index increased by 1.4% (in
annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)), in February - by +1.2%, in March - by +0.7%, in April -
by +0.3%, in May - by +0.1%, and in August - decreased by -0.2%, which
indicates low inflationary pressure and even a slowdown in inflation.
Forecast for September: +0.2% (annualized). If the data turns out to be
worse than forecast, the euro may fall sharply in the short term. The
data better than the forecast and / or the previous value may strengthen
the euro in the short term, despite the low value (the target level of
consumer inflation by the ECB is slightly below 2.0%).

Core Consumer Price Index (Core CPI) determines the change in prices of
a selected basket of goods and services for a given period and is a key
indicator for assessing inflation and changes in consumer preferences.
Food and energy have been excluded from this indicator to provide a more
accurate estimate. A high result strengthens the EUR, while a low result
weakens it. In January, Core CPI increased by 1.1% (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)), in
February - by +1.2%, in March - by +1.0%, in April and May - by +0.9%,
and in August - by +0.4%. If the data for September turn out to be worse
than the previous value or forecast, this may negatively affect the
euro. If the data turns out to be better than the forecast or the
previous value, the euro is likely to respond with an increase in
quotations, but only in the short term. Inflation in the Eurozone
remains low, which is a negative factor for the euro. Forecast for
September: +0.7%.

###  **12:15 USD ADP National Employment Report** ****

Typically, the ADP private sector employment report has a strong impact
on the market and the dollar. An increase in the value of this indicator
has a positive effect on the dollar. It is expected that the growth in
the number of workers in the private sector in the United States in
September was 650,000 (against +428,000 in August). The growth of the
indicator should have a positive effect on the dollar quotes.

Therefore, the market reaction may be positive, and the dollar will
strengthen if the data is confirmed or turns out to be better than the
forecast.

Millions of Americans have previously been laid off due to the
coronavirus pandemic and related quarantine measures. The bulk of the
layoffs were concentrated in tourism and retail. Other important sectors
of the economy were also affected. ADP previously reported that the most
significant drop in employment was recently noted in the construction
and financial services sectors.

While the ADP report does not correlate directly with official US Labor
Department data due Friday, it may fall short of forecasts, pointing to
a decline in nonfarm payrolls instead of an expected 0.875 million new
job growth.

If the forecast (+0.875 million new jobs) from the US Department of
Labor does not come true, it will indicate a reversal of the current
trend in the rate of hiring, while millions of Americans have lost the
previously increased unemployment benefits.

###  **12:30 USD US Annual GDP for Q2 (Final Release)**

GDP data is one of the key indicators (along with labor market and
inflation data) for the Fed in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of its monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). Strong
result strengthens US dollar; weak GDP report negatively affects the US
dollar. In the previous 1st quarter, GDP declined by -5.0% after growing
by 2.1% in the 3rd and 4th quarters of 2019. The preliminary forecast
for the 2nd quarter of 2020 was -32.9%. The data already takes into
account the impact of the coronavirus on the American economy. The final
estimate assumes a fall in GDP in the 2nd quarter by -31.7%. Since the
strong drop in GDP has already been priced in, the publication of data
with a slight deviation from the forecast and the first estimate will
not cause strong volatility in dollar quotes. The data weaker than the
forecast and the previous value will have a negative impact on the
dollar.

###  **23:50 JPY Tankan Large Manufacturing Index**

This index reflects general business conditions for large Japanese
manufacturing companies and is an indicator of the current state of
Japan's export-oriented economy, which is highly dependent on the
industrial sector.

An indicator value above 0 (0 is the middle line) is a positive factor
for the JPY, while an indicator value below 0 is negative.

According to the forecast, the index value is expected to be -23 (for
the 3rd quarter) after falling to -8 in the 1st quarter and to -34 in
the 2nd quarter of 2020. This is still very low, which is unlikely to
support the yen's position.

###  **Thursday, October 1**

###  **14:00** **USD ISM Manufacturing PMI**

The Institute of Supply Management (ISM) Manufacturing PMI is an
important indicator of the health of the American economy as a whole. A
result above 50 is seen as positive and strengthens the USD, one below
50 as negative for the US dollar. Forecast: 56.0 in September (against
56.0 in August, 54.2 in July, 43.1 in May, 41.5 in April, 49.1 in March,
50.1 in February). The index value is above 50 and not below the
previous value, which can support the dollar in the short term. Data
above 50 indicates an acceleration in activity, which has a positive
effect on the quotes of the national currency. If the indicator drops
below the forecast and the value of 50, the dollar may drop sharply.

###  **Friday, October 2**

###  **01:30 AUD Retail Sales Index**

Retail Sales Index is published monthly by the Australian Bureau of
Statistics and measures total retail sales. The index is often
considered an indicator of consumer confidence and reflects the health
of the retail sector in the near term. Index growth is usually positive
for the AUD; a decrease in the indicator will negatively affect the AUD.
The previous value of the index (for July) was + 3.2% after falling by
-17.7% in April. If the data for August turns out to be weaker than the
previous value, then the AUD may sharply decline in the short term. The
preliminary forecast was -4.2%.

###  **12:30 USD Average hourly wages. Non-Farm Payrolls. Unemployment
rate**

These are most important indicators of the state of the labor market in
the United States in September. Forecast: +0.4% (against +0.4% in
August, +0.2% in July, -1.2% in June, -1.0% in May, +4.7% in April) /
+0.875 million (against +1.371 million in August, +1.763 million in
July, +4.8 million in June, +2.509 million in May and -20.687 million in
April) / 8.3% (against 8.4% in August , 10.2% in July, 11.1% in June,
13.3% in May and 14.7% in April), respectively.

In general, the indicators can not yet be described as positive, but
they are quite understandable due to mass layoffs in American companies
and the closure of offices and shops due to the coronavirus. At the same
time, the data indicate a gradual improvement in the US labor market
after its collapse in previous months at the beginning of the year.
Prior to the coronavirus, the US labor market remained strong, signaling
the stability of the American economy and supporting the dollar.

It is often difficult to predict the market reaction to the publication
of indicators. Many indicators for previous periods may be revised. Now
it will be even more difficult to do this, because the economic
situation in many other large economies is no better. In any case, when
data from the US labor market is published, a surge in volatility is
expected in trading not only in USD, but throughout the entire financial
market. The most cautious [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s might choose to stay out of the
market during this time.
