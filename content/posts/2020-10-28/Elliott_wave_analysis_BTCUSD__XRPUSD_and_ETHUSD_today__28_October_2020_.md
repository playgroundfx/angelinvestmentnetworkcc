Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 28.10.2020Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I suggest entry signals
to trade each cryptocurrency.

Major cryptocurrency pairs are currently developing impulse waves, the
market is expected to rise in the coming trading days.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

 ****

There is an upward linking wave X] in the structure of BTCUSD, it takes
the form of a double zigzag (W)-(X)-(Y). As part of the final wave (Y),
there is the development of an impulse wave (C), its middle wave [3] to
be precise, it takes the form of an impulse. Most likely, in the near
future, this impulse wave will be completed around the level of
14050.00, then after a slight pullback in the corrective wave [4], the
growth may resume in the wave [5] towards the level of 15200.00.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 13814.75, TP 14050.00

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

 ****

The current XRPUSD structure shows a downward zigzag A-B-C, in which the
first part, impulse A, is fully completed, currently we see the
development of corrective wave B. Correction B takes the form of a
triple zigzag. Apparently, the first four parts of this structure have
been completed, and now wave [Z] in the form of a double zigzag is
developing. Most likely, wave (y) will be completed close to the level
of 0.273.

### Trading plan for **[XRPUSD][2]** today:

Buy 0.253, TP 0.273

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

 ****

As part of the downward zigzag A-B-C, a bearish wave A has been
completed in the form of a five-wave impulse, then an upward corrective
wave B began to develop. Most likely, this correction will soon end. It
is a double zigzag [W]-[X]-[Y], and now the last impulse is developing
as part of the final actionary wave [Y]. The growth may continue to the
level of 443.00. Consider opening long trades.

### Trading plan for  **[ETHUSD][3] **today:

Buy 405.32, TP 443.00
