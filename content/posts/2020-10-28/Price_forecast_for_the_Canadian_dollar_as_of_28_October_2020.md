Bank of Canada is offside. Forecast for USDCAD as of 28.10.2020Dmitri
Demidenko

The loonie has grown more dependent on the global stock market’s state
lately. That may give a free hand to the Bank of Canada at the 28
October meeting. Let’s discuss and make a trading plan for the
[USDCAD][1].

## Weekly fundamental forecast for the Canadian dollar

Are you tired of the US presidential election? No problem! Let’s play
the “monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)” game. The Bank of Canada’s meeting will give us a
chance. Tiff Macklem and his colleagues had promised to keep the
overnight rate at 0.25% until the slump was over, and the inflation
target of 2% was reached, which may take years. However, buying CA$5
billion in bonds every week increases the BoC’s share in the bond
market. The market is growing more dependent on the Bank’s actions. The
risk of destabilization is growing too. How will Ottawa settle that up?

In contrast to other G10 central banks, the Bank of Canada had a chance
to follow the Fed’s example and soften aggressively monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) in
response to the pandemic and recession. As a result, the overnight rate
collapsed from 1.75% to 0.25%, and the scale of the local QE program was
really impressive compared with the size of economy on a relative basis.
The problem is that Canada’s bond market is small, and the BoC’s share
started growing too fast, exceeding the level of 30% in October. The
current situation is now similar to that of Japan, which has “a whale in
the pond.” At the same time, lowering the volume of asset buying would
be dangerous as it may provoke a “tapering” hysteria like in the case of
the Fed in 2013.

Positive macro-stats on Canada, including labor market figures, allow
presuming a faster-than-expected economic recovery. The Bloomberg
experts expect that the BoC will upgrade GDP growth forecasts for
2020-2021, which is a bearish factor for the [USDCAD][1].

At first sight, the CAD sellers should be concerned about a drop in bond
buy volumes and optimistic GDP forecasts. However, the Canadian dollar’s
rate is more dependent on external factors. That may give a free hand to
the Bank of Canada, allowing it to say whatever it wants without fearing
the national currency’s consolidation.

According to the Royal Bank of Canada’s research, since February, the
[USDCAD][1]/global stock correlation has grown from 43% to 84%. The
correlation with oil and bond yield differentials fell from 53% to 40%
and from 42% to 28%, respectively.

Thus, the loonie is more sensitive to global risk appetite, which
depends on the US presidential election results and COVID-19 rates.
However hard [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s may want to drop the US elections subject, doing
that will be hard.

### Weekly trading plan for the [USDCAD][1]

I think the hawkish notes of the Bank of Canada’s accompanying statement
and Joe Biden’s victory may result in the [USDCAD][1]’s fall to 1.305. A
successful test of support at 1.317 or a pullback from resistance at
1.3245 may be a signal for selling. On the contrary, an unexpected
victory of Donald Trump, who introduces and then cancels taxes on
Canadian aluminum imports, may help the pair soar to 1.345.
