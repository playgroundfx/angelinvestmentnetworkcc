Forex held hostage by the Fed. Forecast as of 22.02.2021Dmitri Demidenko

For now, the Fed doesn't even think about raising rates and curtailing
QE [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), but what will happen when the central bank gets down to
business? To answer this question, it makes sense to refer to the 2013
events. Let us discuss the Forex outlook and make up a trading plan for
[USDMXN][1] and [USDZAR][2].

## Monthly peso and rand fundamental forecast

Extrapolation is typical not only for technical but also for fundamental
analysis. The recessions followed by the global economic recovery are
serious food for thought. The dollar smile theory, a V-shaped stock
market recovery, and a rally in Treasury yields have all occurred in the
previous economic crisis. If so, the plan of action is known.

Currently, there are many analogies with the 2013 taper tantrum, when
Ben Bernanke, the head of the Fed, provoked panic in the financial
markets with his statement about the closing of the QE program. The
yield on 10-year US bonds rose 125 bps from May to December, and risky
currencies were actively sold off as carry traders flee. From June 2020
to February 2021, Treasury rates increased by 85 bps. Although the main
reason for the rally is the belief in the recovery of the US and world
economies, some patterns in the movement of exchange rates can be found
this time.

7.5 years ago, the Australian and New Zealand dollars were affected the
most among the G10 monetary units. While the euro, yen, and pound's
positions were stable. The first two assets, along with the US dollar,
are the main funding currencies, so exiting carry trades makes it easy
to explain the reasons for their success. Noteworthy is the weakening of
the yen in October-December 2013 against the background of continued
high global risk appetite.

Taking a broader range of assets, including emerging market currencies,
the biggest losers 7.5 years ago were the high-yielding currencies with
current account deficits of Central America, Asia, and Africa.

How can the presented research be used? There are two [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/). Wait
until the Fed's stance becomes hawkish, which most likely will not
happen before the second half of this year. Or assume that the rally in
Treasury yields is about to come to an end. Investors will understand
that the rising debt market rates will not worry the Fed, which will
continue to remain passive. As a result, May-December 2013 and June
2020-February 2021 outsiders can quickly turn into the main Forex
favorites.

### [USDMXN][1] and [USDZAR][2] trading plan for a month

First of all, we are talking about the South African rand and the
Mexican peso. About 82% of Mexico's exports go to the United States, and
the US economy's strong recovery will support the peso. South African
exports are more diversified. The country's main partners are world
leaders in economics, China, Germany, and the US. In connection with the
above, sell [USDMXN][1] on the rise to 20.95 and 21.06, and enter
[USDZAR][2] short trades when the price rebounds from resistances at
15.1 and 15.27.
