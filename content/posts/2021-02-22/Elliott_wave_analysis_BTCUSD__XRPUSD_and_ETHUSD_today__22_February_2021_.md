Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 22.02.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

The BTCUSD and ETHUSD should be growing in the impulse waves. XRPUSD is
expected to form a bullish zigzag.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

After the corrective wave (4) finished, the market has started rising in
the bullish impulse wave composed of the sub-waves 1-2-3-4-5. There is
now developing impulse wave 3. The first four sub-waves of wave 3 must
have completed. Correction [4] has recently completed as a skewed
triangle. There is now unfolding the fourth leg of the bullish impulse
[5]. The corrective price movement should end soon, and the market will
resume rising in wave (5) to a level of 62100.00.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 55848.00, TP 62100.00

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

The market continues forming the middle leg of the large upward zigzag
[A]-[B]-[C]; the deep corrective wave [B] is unfolding. Correction [B]
is developing as a triple zigzag (w)-(x)-(y)-(xx)-(z). The linking wave
(xx) must have finished as a triple zigzag. In the medium term, there
should be forming the zigzag-shaped wave (z) to a level of 0.670. An
approximate trajectory of the Ripple future price movement is outlined
in the chart.

### Trading plan for **[XRPUSD][2]** today:

Buy 0.520, TP 0.670

* * *

## Elliott wave Ethereum analysis

The ETHUSD is forming the bullish impulse wave, like the BTCUSD. The
chart displays the final leg of the corrective wave 4, which is a
triangle. After wave 4 finished, the price has started rising in impulse
wave 5. There is developing the final sub-wave of impulse 5, wave [v].
There should be unfolding sub-waves (iii)-(iv)-(v), driving the price to
a level of 2300.00, as outline in the chart. One could enter long
positions in the current situation.

### Trading plan for  **[ETHUSD][3] **today:

Buy 1853.90, TP 2300.00
