The dollar did it!Dmitri Demidenko

##  **Is Greenback the reason for US stock market madness?**

When the US stock market recovered after the 2009 crisis, they called it
“the most hated rally in [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/)”. Back then, most [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s became
hostages to their own scepticism as they had believed that a recession
that large would make [S&P 500][1]  collapse much deeper than it
actually did.

The current recovery of US stock indexes has lasted for about 10 months,
but it has already become a new “most hated rally”. The markets are far
from reality, shares go off like hot cakes and S&P 500 behaves like a
true woman. Women usually prefer being beautiful to being smart because
men usually prefer watching to thinking.

FOMC officials, Wall Street Journal experts, Ways and Means Committee
and other competent organisations say that a V-shaped economic recovery
is no longer a matter of fact, but the market doesn’t want to search for
any other letters. The unemployment rate soared to 20%. The States
plunged into the deepest recession since the Great Depression. Donald
Trump continues putting pressure on China and Beijing halts imports of
US _agriculture products_. But [S&P 500][1] pays no attention to
geopolitics, recessions or mass protests:

> \- Listen! Don’t even try using fake money in shops.

>

> \- They won’t strangle me for that and start a revolution, will they?

If the number of new coronavirus cases isn’t rapidly growing amidst US
riots in the next few days, it will be really suspicious. The Fed
representatives hint at new stimulus packages and a W-shape recovery
that the second epidemic wave will lead to. However, when stocks grow so
fast, the sense of fear vanishes. Many are afraid of missing out on the
opportunity to buy and they just buy, and buy, and buy.

> Mom would tell me you’re an idiot.  Your own mom!

Some things make no sense: in the market there are rumours that the main
reason for [S&P 500][1]’s rally was the weakness of the USD. They say
the fall of the USD index boosts US companies’ competitiveness and their
corporate profit. But for that to be true, there must be a time lag
between the two events. I’d rather believe that stocks buying increased
the share of dollars in investment portfolios as the USD is a tool
hedging against a poorer global appetite for risk. The appetite didn’t
and will hardly get worse as the global economy is recovering. So, they
are just getting rid of the greenback. But isn’t it too early?

The higher euphoria, the stronger disappointment. Beware! [S&P 500][1]
still has many reasons for falling and bulls may be duped at any moment.
