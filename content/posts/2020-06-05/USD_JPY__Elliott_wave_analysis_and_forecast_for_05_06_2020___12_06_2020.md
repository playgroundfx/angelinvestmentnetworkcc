USD/JPY: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 05/06/2020 –
12/06/2020Alex Geuta

## [USD/JPY][1] remains likely to grow. Estimated pivot point is at a
level of 108.20.

 **Main scenario:** long positions should be considered from corrections
above the level of 108.20 with a target of 110.75 – 111.80.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
108.20 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of 107.34
– 106.72.

 **Analysis:** On the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame, apparently a descending
correction of larger degree finished forming as wave B and wave С
started developing. On the H4 time frame, the first wave 1 of (1) of C
formed and a local correction finished forming as wave 2 of (1).
Apparently, wave  3 of (1) started forming on the H1 time frame. Inside
it, there’s the first wave i of 3 formed, a descending correction
developed as wave ii of 3 and the third wave iii of 3 developing. If the
presumption is correct, the pair will continue to rise to the levels of
110.75 – 111.80. The level of 108.20 is critical in this scenario as the
breakout will enable the pair to continue declining to the levels of
107.34 – 106.72.
