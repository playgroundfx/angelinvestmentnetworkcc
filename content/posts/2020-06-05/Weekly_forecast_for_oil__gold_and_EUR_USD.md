Weekly forecast for oil, gold and EUR/USDAlex Rodiоnov

###  **USCrude – oil**

This week, the oil price has broken out the strong middle-term
resistance Target Zone 4 [34.17 – 33.42] and consolidated above. The
next upside target is now Target Zone 5 [41.67 – 40.92]. The trend's key
support is in the zone [28.38 – 27.48].

For next week, I suggest expecting the oil price correction down to the
zone of the trend key support and enter new long trades according to the
patterns there.

I do not recommend selling oil as the uptrend is strong and the
resistance level has been broken out. It won’t be relevant to sell oil
unless the trend reverses down, or the price tests TZ5 and forms a
reversal pattern.

37.25. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

###  **XAUUSD – gold**

Sell trades entered after the 20th of May have been exited at the
breakeven this week. However, the price hasn’t consolidated above level
1740 or formed a reversal pattern to buy. As a result, there is a false
breakout of the previous important extreme price, and the gold price
continues correcting down. The correction target is Target Zone [1673.6
– 1664.4].

I do not recommend entering any trades before the correction target is
reached. When the key support is tested, I suggest looking for a buy
pattern and entering purchases with a target to break through the
previous monthly high.

###  **EURUSD – euro/dollar**

The EURUSD is trading in the middle-term uptrend.

This week, the price has broken out Target Zone 2 [1.1109 - 1.1091] and
Target Zone 3 [1.1291 – 1.1273]. The upside target is now Target Zone 4
[1.1473 - 1.1455].

It is relevant to enter purchases in the trend according to the pattern.
The trend’s key support is now in the zone of [1.1201 - 1.1183]. If the
price breaks through the local high, the support should be rearranged
following the price.
