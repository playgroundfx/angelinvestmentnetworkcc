GBPUSD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 12.02.21 – 19.02.21Alex
Geuta

 **Main scenario:** Consider short positions below the level of 1.3868
with a target of 1.3209 – 1.2878.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
1.3868 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 1.3950 –
1.4050.

 **Analysis:** Daily time frame: presumably, the first wave of larger
degree (1) formed and a downside correction is starting to form as wave
(2). The fifth wave of smaller degree (v) of v of 5 finished forming as
an ending diagonal triangle on the H4 time frame. Apparently, the fifth
wave (v) of v of 5 of (1) formed and wave (2) is starting to form on the
H1 time frame. If the presumption is correct, the pair may be expected
to drop to the levels of 1.3209 – 1.2878. The level of 1.3868 is
critical in this scenario as the breakout will enable the pair to
continue rising to the levels of 1.3950 – 1.4050.
