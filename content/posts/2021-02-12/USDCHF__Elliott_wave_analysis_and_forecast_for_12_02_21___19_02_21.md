USDCHF: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 12.02.21 – 19.02.21Alex
Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions from corrections above the
level of 0.8816 with a target of 0.9115 – 0.9334.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
0.8816 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of 0.8700
– 0.8600

 **Analysis:** Presumably, the descending first wave of larger degree
(1) of 5 finished developing on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame, with wave 5 of (1)
formed inside. An ascending correction started developing as wave (2) on
the H4 time frame, with wave A of (2) forming inside. On the H1 time
frame, apparently, the third wave of smaller degree iii of А formed, and
wave iv of A is nearing completion. If this assumption is correct, the
pair will continue to rise to 0.9115 – 0.9334. The level of 0.8816 is
critical in this scenario. Its breakout will allow the pair to continue
falling to the levels of 0.8700 – 0.8600
