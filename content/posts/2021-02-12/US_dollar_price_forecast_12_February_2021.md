Dollar: Time matters. Forecast as of 12.02.2021Dmitri Demidenko

The Fed’s [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) remains unchanged over a long time, making [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s
revise the former trading ideas, suggesting the [EURUSD][1] uptrend
recovery. Let us discuss the Forex outlook and make up a trading plan.

## Weekly US dollar fundamental forecast

Experienced traders know that the time of the investment is often more
important than the trade direction. In late 2020, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s were
confident that the [EURUSD][1] would probably reach level 1.25 in the
first quarter. In early January, Reuters experts predicted 0.6% GDP
growth in the eurozone during the first three months of the year. In
addition to the vaccination progress and high risk appetite, the euro-
area economic recovery should have encouraged the euro bulls to go
ahead. However, economists revised the projections down due to lockdowns
and slow vaccination. Now, the euro-area GDP is expected to contract by
0.8%. Traders are disappointed. If the euro fails to hit a level of
$1.26 in the second quarter, it could fall to $1.15.

If we solve the time puzzle, we can learn a lot. And we could achieve a
lot. Remarkably, the Fed could give [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s a clue. The former US
central bankers didn’t want to provide accurate signals about the Fed’s
future [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) as this would either encourage excessive complacency in
the market or discourage [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s. Or both at the same time. However,
in the last decade, the US central bankers are prone to demonstrating
how the Fed will react to incoming economic data, which is supposed to
prevent the market from shocks. And here's a new feature. The regulator
focuses on time. The Fed does not intend to raise the federal fund rate
earlier than 2023; it will not pull back on the QE until the end of
2021. It does not matter what the direction of economic indicators will
be. The main factor is time!

If the Fed’s attitude change, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s should also change their views.
Although the US stock indexes look overbought, in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of P/E ratio,
they do not cease breaking through the all-time highs. And the trading
volumes on the US stock exchanges are close to their ten-year high,
which took place during the market turmoil in March.

What's the matter? Have Investors lost their sense of Fear amid the huge
flows of cheap liquidity? This is certainly true, but they must believe
that the Fed will keep rates low for a very long time. This means that
fundamental assessments need to be revised. The [S&P 500][2] rally is
far from being exhausted!

What is valid for the equity market is right for Forex. The dollar smile
theory should have worked out. The divergence in the economic expansion
should have supported the dollar bulls. Wall Street Journal experts
revised the forecasts for US GDP for 2021 to 4.9%, up from 4.3% in
January. On the contrary, the European Commission lowers its projections
for the euro-area economic growth to 3.9%. Nonetheless, the [EURUSD][1]
is steadily rising! Is it a paradox?

### Weekly [EURUSD][1] trading plan

The real reason is the Fed’s focus on time. The US low interest rates
support not only the US economy but also global growth. The US GDP rise
is a sign of the global GDP rebound. Therefore, it is relevant to buy
the [EURUSD][1] on the breakout of the resistance 1.215 or on the
correction towards 1.208.
