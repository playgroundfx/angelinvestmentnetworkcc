Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 12.02.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

The ETHUSD market should complete the large bullish impulse in the next
few days.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

After the bearish triple zigzag finished, the price has started rising
in the new impulse wave [1]-[2]-[3]-[4]-[5]. The sub-waves [1] and [2]
have completed. There is unfolding the bullish wave [3] as a simple
five-wave impulse. Within impulse [3], there is forming the final, fifth
sub-wave 5, which is an element of wave (5). The sub-wave 5 should end
at a level of 49600.00. Next, the market could be declining in the
bearish corrective wave [4].

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 47118.50 TP 49600.00

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

As you see from the most recent section of the XRPUSD chart, there is
forming wave W as a descending zigzag [A]-[B]-[C]. The market must have
completed forming the corrective wave [B] as a triple zigzag
(w)-(x)-(y)-(x)-(z). So, the price should soon start declining in the
impulse wave [C]. The price could go down below level 0.382, which is
the low marked by the linking wave (xx).

### Trading plan for **[XRPUSD][2]** today:

Sell 0.531, TP 0.382

## Elliott wave Ethereum analysis

After wave 4 ended as a skewed triangle, the market has resumed rising
in impulse wave 5. Within impulse 5, there have completed the motive
sub-waves [i] and [iii], and the corrective sub-waves [ii] and [iv].
There is now forming the bullish impulse [v], namely its final sub-wave
(5). The price could be rising up to level 1945.00. Therefore, one could
enter long trades in the current situation.

### Trading plan for  **[ETHUSD][3] **today:
