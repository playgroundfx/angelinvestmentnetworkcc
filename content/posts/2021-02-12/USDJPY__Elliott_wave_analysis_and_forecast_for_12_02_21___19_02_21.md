USDJPY: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 12.02.21 – 19.02.21Alex
Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 105.74 with a target of 101.74 – 100.00.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
105.74 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 107.01 –
108.18.

 **Analysis:** Daily time frame: presumably, a correction of larger
degree is completed in the form of wave (B). Wave (С) has started to
form, with the third wave 3 of (C) developing inside. The third wave of
smaller degree iii of 3 formed on the H4 time frame, and an ascending
correction is completed as the fourth wave iv of 3. Apparently, the
fifth wave v of 3 started developing on the H1 time frame. If this
assumption is correct, the pair will continue to fall to 101.74 –
100.00. The level of 105.74 is critical in this scenario as the breakout
will enable the pair to continue growing to the levels of 107.01 –
108.18.
