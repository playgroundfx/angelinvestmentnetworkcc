Euro: Save Italy or die! Review as of 12.02.2021Dmitri Demidenko

Italy believes in Ex-President of ECB while India still waits for
Columbus.

## This city needs a new hero. Can Mario Draghi be the one?

There are seven billion people on Earth, so why are you texting your ex?
Italian President Sergio Mattarella's decision to appoint the ECB's ex-
President Mario Draghi Messiah looked wise at first sight. Mario Draghi
had saved the euro, so why couldn't he save Rome? The problem is that
many things Draghi had done while in the Chair finally pushed Italy to
the verge of disaster. If Draghi had known he would become Italian PM,
would he have driven his own country and himself into a corner?

At the height of the 2011 debt crisis in Europe, Draghi demanded that
Italy cut government expenditure and budget deficit. In 2011, the IMF
predicted that Italy's GDP would grow 0.7%. But then, following the
severe budget restrictions and the recession, it cut the forecast to
minus 0.3% and estimated that the Italian economy wouldn't expand by
more than 0.5% annually in the following four years.

In 2012, Super Mario supported the European Commission's idea about a
tougher fiscal consolidation, which brought Rome to its knees once and
for all.​

Theory teaches us to look forward while practice teaches us to mind our
steps. These are different times and morals now. Dark empty spaces look
less dangerous than crowded places in the daytime. How can one speak
about a more severe budget discipline when the pandemic continues
disturbing humanity and the global economy?

Those who were asked to tighten their belts can now spend money freely.
First, you defeat COVID-19, and then you pay your debt. By the way, both
the EU and the ECB are ready to give a hand to Rome. Brussels will lend
money from the Recovery fund, and the ECB will continue to hold Italian
bond yields at a record low level. Did the powers that be decide to
sweeten the Italians’ life?

However, that's not the end of Mario Draghi's paradox. Once, he did all
he could to drown the euro as the [EURUSD][1]'s growth held back the
inflation in the eurozone. The ECB wasn't able to reach the consumer
price index target at 2%, and it put the kibosh on the euro bulls using
the QE program and verbal interventions. Draghi's return to the global
stage is considered to be a reason for buying the euro. They say Italy
and the whole EU have been waiting for the Messiah like that for a long
time. He will handle the finances, the crisis, and political risks. Will
he? Aren't they still waiting for Columbus in India?

I want to hope for the best. This city needs a new hero. It can be the
man who once saved the euro and is now ready to save Italy, with his
sleeves rolled up. It can be a person who knows [how to](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-trading-how-to/) earn millions on
Forex and who teaches others to trade for $300 instead.
