USDCAD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 12.02.21 – 19.02.21Alex
Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 1.2880 with a target of 1.2450 – 1.2300.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
1.2880 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 1.3074 –
1.3376.

 **Analysis:** Daily time frame: wave (С) of 4 of larger degree
continues developing, with the first wave 1 of (C) forming inside.
Presumably, the fifth wave v of 1 of (C) is forming on the H4 time
frame. Wave (iii) of v of smaller degree formed, and a correction is
completed in the form of wave (iv) of v as part of the fifth wave v of 1
of (C). Apparently, the fifth wave (v) of v is developing on the H1 time
frame. If this assumption is correct, the pair will continue to fall to
1.2450 – 1.2300. The level of 1.2880 is critical in this scenario as the
breakout will enable the pair to continue rising to the levels of 1.3074
– 1.3376.
