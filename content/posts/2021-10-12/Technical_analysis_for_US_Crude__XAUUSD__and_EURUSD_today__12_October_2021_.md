Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 12.10.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

The euro continues to trade in the range between the Additional Zone
1.1577 - 1.1573 and the Target Zone 2 1.1556 - 1.1539.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

Yesterday, buyers tried to break out the Target Zone 80.34 - 79.83. The
price could not consolidate above the zone. As a result, a correction
began to develop, within which the Additional Zone 80.00 - 79.87 was
tested.

While the Additional Zone is being held, look for purchases according to
the pattern with the target at yesterday's high.

As soon as the AZ is broken out, there will be an opportunity to start
selling into the correction with the target in the Intermediary Zone
78.72 - 78.46.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

  1. Buy according to the pattern in Additional Zone 80.00 - 79.87. TakeProfit: 81.11. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. Sell from the zone of 80.35 - 79.83 when the Additional Zone 80.00 - 79.87 is broken out. TakeProfit: Intermediary Zone 78.72 - 78.46. StopLoss: 80.90.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

Gold is recovering the positions lost last Friday. Now the price is
returning to the key support of the short-term uptrend 1762 - 1760. If
during today's trading session the traders manage to consolidate the
price above level 1762, the uptrend will continue with the target in the
Gold Zone 1786 - 1784. In this case, it is profitable to enter
purchases.

Otherwise, the price will decline and reach the lower Target Zone 1743 -
1740. A breakout of the Target Zone downside will trigger a decline with
a target at the September lows.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

Open buy positions according to the pattern in 1762 - 1755. TakeProfit:
Gold Zone 1786 - 1784. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

The euro continues to trade in the range between the Additional Zone
1.1577 - 1.1573 and the Target Zone 2 1.1556 - 1.1539. It is necessary
to break out level 1.1536 and consolidate the price below to enter new
sales within the current downtrend. In this case, the new target for
sales will be Gold Zone 2 1.1469 - 1.1460.

If the Additional Zone is broken out, a deep correction will begin. Its
first target will be the IZ 1.1626 - 1.1617. In this case, enter
purchases with a stop loss beyond the AZ.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:
