Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 12.10.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

Bitcoin and Ethereum should soon finish the third sub-waves in large
impulses. Ripple seems to have completed the bearish correction and
should soon start rising in the impulse.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

The BTCUSD market must be forming correction [B] as a simple zigzag
(A)-(B)-(C). The first two legs of the zigzag have finished, and there
is unfolding its final leg, impulse wave (C). Sub-waves 1 and 2 have
completed in the (C) impulse, sub-wave 3 is still developing. The
Bitcoin price should continue rising in sub-wave [5], which will
conclude impulse 3 around the level of 59500.00. Next, the market will
be declining in corrective wave 4, as outlined in the chart

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 56746.50, TP 59500.00

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

The XRPUSD market continues forming the descending corrective trend as
the double zigzag W-X-Y. There is developing the upward linking wave X
as a simple zigzag [A]-[B]-[C], with impulse wave [C] unfolding inside.
In the [C] wave, bearish correction (4) has completed, so the price
should be rising in wave (5) to a level of 1.276. At this level, wave X
will be 76.4% of wave W. One could enter long trades in the current
situation.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] **** today:

Buy 1.089, TP 1.276

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

The ETHUSD market is rising in corrective wave B composed of three major
sub-waves [A]-[B]-[C]. There is developing the bullish impulse wave [C]
composed of sub-waves (1)-(2)-(3)-(4)-(5). There must be forming the
final leg of the upward impulse (3), which will end at a level of around
3750.00. After the price reaches this level, it should start declining
in correction (4), as outlined in the chart. One could enter purchases
in the current situation.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Buy 3467.57, TP 3750.00
