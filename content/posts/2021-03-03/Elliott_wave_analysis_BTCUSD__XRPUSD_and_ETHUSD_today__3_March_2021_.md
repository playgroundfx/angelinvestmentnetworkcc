Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 03.03.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

Over the next few days, all three cryptocurrency pairs, covered in the
article, should be developing impulse waves. Let us examine the market
situation for each pair in more detail.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

There is forming a downward double zigzag [W]-[X]-[Y]. The first sub-
wave [W] of this corrective pattern is also a bearish double zigzag
(W)-(X)-(Y). The linking upward wave [X], currently unfolding, is likely
to complete as a simple zigzag (a)-(b)-(c). Impulse (a) and the downward
correction (b) look complete. Therefore, the Bitcoin price should be
rising in the (c) impulse to a level of 52500.00. At level 52500.00,
wave [X] will be 61.8% of wave [W].

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 48649.50, TP 52500.00

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

The final motive wave [C] is developing as a five-wave impulse within
the downward simple zigzag [A]-[B]-[C] of a larger degree. The extended
corrective wave (4) completed as a skewed triangle, as the construction
lines of the triangle are directed down, like the impulse wave [C].
Therefore, there should be unfolding the final wave (5) towards a level
of 0.300.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] today:

Sell 0.434, TP 0.300

* * *

## Elliott wave Ethereum analysis

The ETHUSD market, like the BTCUSD, is forming a downward double zigzag
W-X-Y. The first motive wave W finished as a simple zigzag [A]-[B]-[C].
The market is now rising in the linking wave X, which is developing as a
simple zigzag [a]-[b]-[c]. The sub-waves [a] and [b] must have finished,
and the [c] wave should be unfolding over the next few days. The price
could reach level 1745.00, following the [c] impulse. At level 1745.00,
wave X will be 61.8% of wave W.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Buy 1510.43, TP 1745.00
