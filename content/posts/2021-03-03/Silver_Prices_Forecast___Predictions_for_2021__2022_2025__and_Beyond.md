Silver Prices Forecast: 2021 and BeyondJana Kane

The silver price has been rising considerably in the past six months.
The price has for a long-time underperformed gold, but its popularity
has increased again. Over six months ago, the price of XAG was below
$18, and a few months later, it almost hit $30. Recently we saw the
price stabilize again. In this silver price forecast, we discuss the
latest silver price expectations for 2021. In this investment outlook,
we will look at both the fundamental rationale and the technical signals
provided by prediction charts.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Silver: A Historical Overview

Silver is a precious metal used in jewelry and industry (cutlery and
electronics). Investors can buy silver in standard or measured bars and
coins or speculate on the spot price of silver. Although its chemical
symbol is Ag, silver is known by the symbol [XAG][1] in the financial
markets.

Silver price movement charts can be used as an indicator of the
economy's state, and real-time tracking of precious metal prices can
sometimes help predict silver demand, the future value of silver, and
price movements in several financial markets, including major
commodities, currency pairs, and stocks.

Silver as an asset class has a [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) of thousands of years, dating
back to the first recorded mining in 3000 BC. As its popularity grew,
mining spread throughout the world, and the use and value of silver
increased. By the end of the 19th century, 120 million troy ounces a
year were being produced to meet the precious metal demand.

The silver price change began to be recorded in the 1970s when silver
was introduced at a starting price of $1.80 per troy ounce. In the early
1980s, the value of silver rose to $36 but soon dropped to below $10,
where it remained for more than two decades.

The silver price record high was set on January 18, 1980, at $49.45
(£21.65) per troy ounce fueled by Nelson Bunker Hunt's cornering of the
market. The silver market then peaked at a significant high during the
2008 financial crisis when the price of silver nearly doubled to $20 but
fell again shortly after that. The highest price for silver since then
was recorded in 2011 when it was around $50 an ounce.

Is silver going up, and where are silver prices headed? Keep on reading.

### How Does the Silver Price Come About?

The spot price of silver is determined by the forward contract (future)
of the month with the most volume. This is usually the contract with the
closest expiration date. These futures are traded through various
commodity exchanges such as CME Group's COMEX. The value of silver is
thus directly determined by traders, supply, and demand.

Commodity companies use futures to set a guaranteed price for
commodities such as silver or oil. These forward contracts guarantee
that they can buy or sell the underlying asset at a fixed price and on a
predetermined date. Such agreements significantly reduce risk.

Silver is often seen as gold's little brother. Therefore, the silver
market is much smaller than the gold market, so price movements can be
even more volatile. Silver has a higher beta than gold. That means that
the silver price responds with higher volatility to the overall market
volatility. Naturally, this effect works both upwards and downwards.

Like gold, silver offers some protection against inflation, currency
risks, and stock market falls. Many traditional [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s would rather
not have gold and silver in their portfolio as it does not pay off. The
shiny metal does not give a dividend, and only price gains can provide
returns.

Historically, gold and silver have a low correlation with stocks. A
small percentage of commodities, including gold and silver, can
therefore lower the risk of a well-diversified portfolio.

The price of silver is usually expressed in dollars worldwide. But since
the introduction of the euro, the silver price is increasingly also
shown in euros. The euro/dollar exchange rate has considerable
fluctuations, which can also significantly influence the silver value.

The silver price is expressed in troy per ounce, and one troy ounce
equals 31.1034768 grams. For example, if the silver price is at $16, you
would pay $16 for a little over 31 grams of silver.

## Demand for Silver

In the silver price [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/), the demand for this metal has been on the
rise for years as industrial demand for it is increasing. For example,
silver is widely used in solar panels, and the need for this is growing
exponentially due to the energy transition. When made with silver,
batteries can have a higher capacity, and demand for batteries also
increases at an unprecedented rate. On top of the rising demand is a
falling supply.

Since the coronavirus crisis, all the way through 2020, the price of
silver has skyrocketed. Demand for this precious metal appears to have
increased for inflationary reasons. To combat the coronavirus crisis,
governments and central banks have started printing money en masse.

The money supply is overgrowing, and many [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are now afraid that
this will cause inflation sooner or later. Gold and silver could enjoy
higher demand in such a situation. Therefore, the hedge against
inflation is the first argument for a rising silver price in the coming
years.

Besides, both gold and silver still act as a safe haven. In the event of
political or economic unrest, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s keep turning to precious metals.
A mutated variant of the coronavirus or a financial crisis can also
cause the silver price to skyrocket in the next few years.

## Silver Price Today

On Forex, the silver price today is $26.168. This precious metal is
extensively used in manufacturing, meaning its price is susceptible to
global demand making it volatile to trade. The value is interactive, so
you can refer to this article to find out what the price of silver will
be later this week or next week.

## Silver Price Predictions for 2021 by Experts

The table below shows the 2021 silver price prediction from various
commodity and bank experts. Here’s what they think XAG will be worth in
2021, on average.

Analysts| Silver predictions  
---|---  
Analyst Lawrence Williams| $32.25  
CPM Group| $28.17 on Avg  
Metals Focus| Well above $30  
Citi| $40  
JP Morgan| $26.50  
Bank of America| Above $31  
BNP Paribas| $23.50 on Avg  
Bloomberg Intelligence| Probably  
Goldman Sachs| $40  
  
Next, we’ll look at a long-term silver price forecast through Technical
Analysis.

## Silver Long-Term Technical Analysis

Because the silver market is fairly illiquid and the production of
silver cannot really keep up with demand, this can become interesting.
At present, the silver price of physical silver is more than 30% above
the spot price. The spot price is what we see in the [trading
platform][1] or the price of the future silver price that expires first.
The demand for physical silver is so high that many American [website](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/website-for-forex-trading/)s
even went offline for a while.

Looking at the CFTC report, we note that the institutional [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s
(large banks and hedge funds) have huge short positions on silver. The
question is how this will end. If many derivatives are bought long, the
buyers may be able to go for physical delivery of the silver. And it is
precisely this possibility that may lead to a short squeeze.

If brokers cannot deliver the silver, the price will rise much further.
Obviously, the shorters will run into problems, and a classic short
squeeze can arise.

In the [XAGUSD][1] chart below, we see a downward trend channel drawn in
blue. The outbreak from this channel last summer provided a huge upward
momentum. Using the clap/flap method, we were able to calculate a target
price of approximately $29 per troy ounce. This price target was
achieved within a few weeks, and then the course started to correct
again.

The correction of the silver price analysis has been absorbed by the
current price stops. A new solid bottom around $22 appears to have
formed. As long as this support level remains intact, the silver bull
market appears to be intact.

The new year started with sharply rising prices, but a top was formed
just below $28. That lower top is not very positive, but certainly not a
disaster for the time being. A break from the resistance just below USD
30 is necessary to continue the long-term bullish trend. After a
breakthrough, an increase towards $35/36 per troy ounce can be expected.
In 2011 and 2012, the price had formed price spikes.

A break above the top at $28 could be considered an early buy signal.
The likelihood that the resistance at USD 30 will also break; then the
price rises sharply. Take a look at the following silver price chart.

Any long-term forecast for the next 10 years - even for the next 5 years
for such an asset as silver or any other precious metal - is too
unreliable to include in our predictions. This would be pure
speculation. Because it’s so hard to predict, we will not provide
prediction charts beyond 2025. Too many factors may affect the rate of
silver and the silver price projection, and it’s best to be up-to-date
with what’s happening in the global arena in order to make realistic and
reliable predictions. In the next section of our article, we have
described in detail what factors may affect the price of silver.

## Factors That May Affect the Silver Price

The main factors affecting the price of silver are supply and demand,
the global economy, and the gold/silver ratio.

Here is the list of factors which affecting silver price:

  * Consumption demand
  * Protection against volatility
  * Silver and inflation
  * Silver and interest rates
  * Good monsoon
  * Correlation with other asset classes
  * Geo political factors
  * Weakening dollar
  * Future Silver demand

{shortCodeCouse}[XAGUSD]

### Supply and Demand

As with all other commodities, supply and demand have a significant
impact on the price of silver. An average of 27,000 tons of silver is
mined in the world annually. China, Mexico, and Peru occupy the leading
positions in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of production. The demand of such large importing
countries as the USA, Great Britain, and India can be up to 29,000 tons
of silver per year. Any anticipated increase, decrease, or imbalance
could cause changes in the silver market forecast.

Much of the demand for silver is driven by the growing industrial use of
silver. Silver has the highest electrical conductivity of any metal and
has therefore become a key component in the manufacture of devices such
as solar panels. The precious metal is also widely used in medicine.

### Economic Forces

The global economy also affects the price of silver. During periods of
economic prosperity, silver prices can rise as people buy more
electronics, jewelry, and cars that have silver components. During times
of economic and political crises (covered in the [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/)), silver prices
also rise, as silver is used as a “cheaper” security asset.

### Gold/Silver Ratio

The ratio between the prices of gold and silver shows how many ounces of
silver are needed to buy one ounce of gold. In mid-2019, the gold to
silver ratio was 90 pips, which means that you will need 90 ounces of
silver to buy one ounce of gold. This indicates that silver was
undervalued. When the ratio is high, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s generally prefer silver
because it is cheap compared to gold. At a lower ratio, gold is more
often preferred, and as the ratio decreases, the common solution is to
sell silver and buy gold.

### Silver and USD

Silver and the US dollar have an inverse relationship. This is due to
the fact that the weakening dollar makes silver more affordable for
other countries to buy, which often leads to an increase in XAG quotes.
A strong dollar makes silver more expensive, which means that the metal
will see a price fall.

The inverse relationship between silver and the US dollar makes silver a
popular hedge against inflation - as paper money prices decline,
investing in silver can protect against these losses as the precious
metal retains its value. However, it also means that a strong US dollar
could put downward pressure on the price of silver. We can’t be sure
what will happen in the next 5 years, but we can see what happened in
the past. Below you’ll see how the [XAGUSD][1] rate changed over the
past 5 years:

## What Is the Future of Silver? Is Silver a Good Investment?

Will silver keep going up? The metal’s future price seems to be
stabilizing again after the run-on silver at the beginning of February
2021. Interest in the precious metal is still high, but there does not
seem to be a so-called silver squeeze as yet. However, the silver prices
outlook still looks favorable, as industrial demand for silver is also
picking up and inflation is rising. As a result, many commodities are in
an upward trend again. Together with the return of [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s to the
silver market, this could further support the price of the precious
metal.

Month| Open| Low-High| Close| Mo,%| Total,%  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
 **2021**  
Mar| 29.09| 26.01-29.57| 28.16| -3.2%| -3.2%  
Apr| 28.16| 28.16-31.23| 29.74| 5.6%| 2.2%  
May| 29.74| 29.74-33.16| 31.58| 6.2%| 8.6%  
Jun| 31.58| 31.58-35.22| 33.54| 6.2%| 15.3%  
Jul| 33.54| 32.42-35.84| 34.13| 1.8%| 17.3%  
Aug| 34.13| 32.07-35.45| 33.76| -1.1%| 16.1%  
Sep| 33.76| 30.09-33.76| 31.67| -6.2%| 8.9%  
Oct| 31.67| 31.67-35.31| 33.63| 6.2%| 15.6%  
Nov| 33.63| 33.63-37.51| 35.72| 6.2%| 22.8%  
Dec| 35.72| 33.01-36.49| 34.75| -2.7%| 19.5%

[According to the Silver Institute][3], the silver outlook looks bright
at the moment. They expect a further price increase to $30 per troy
ounce, perhaps much more than the price at the time of writing. This
price increase is not only related to an increase in industrial demand
but also to continued interest in silver as a safe haven.

According to research firm [Metals Focus][4], when the price of silver
falls, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s easily get into [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/)s, while they are much less likely
to sell their position to make a profit. More and more [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are
looking at the long-term forecast and are buying for the longer term and
are therefore holding their position. Especially now that savings no
longer generate interest, the precious metal seems a very attractive
alternative.
