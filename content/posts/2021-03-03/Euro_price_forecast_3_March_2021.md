Euro is trapped in the illusion. Forecast as of 03.03.2021Dmitri
Demidenko

While the ECB uses verbal interventions, the change in the Fed’s tone
stabilizes the global bond market. How will it influence the EURUSD? Let
us discuss the Forex outlook and make up a [EURUSD][1] trading plan.

## Weekly euro fundamental forecast

To solve the problem, one should know the causes. The ECB officials
associate the drop in the euro-area bond yields with their
announcements. However, they are wrong. The rally of the global bond
market rates started in the USA amid the expectations of fiscal stimulus
and rapid recovery of the US economy. It means the Fed, not the other
world’s central bank, should solve the problem. A change in the FOMC
officials' tone has stabilized the bond market, discouraging the
[EURUSD][1] bears.

ECB Executive Board member Fabio Panetta said Tuesday that the jump in
government-bond yields seen in recent weeks “is unwelcome and must be
resisted.” The European Central Bank evaluates market conditions; it can
intervene and change the scale of asset purchases.  Vice President Luis
de Guindos said the ECB has room for maneuver, and it has ammunition.
The ECB has the flexibility to react to yield rise by changing the QE
pace if necessary.

Verbal interventions seem to have become fashionable. The ECB officials
may assume that their announcements discouraged the [EURUSD][1] bulls in
January and clamped down on March's bond sales. Nonetheless, the euro
failed to continue the rally amid a slow vaccination process in the euro
area and the economic expansion divergence. The global bond market has
also stabilized because of different reasons.

Taking into account the Fed’s significance in fighting the recession, it
is natural that [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s pay attention to the speeches of the Fed’s
members. A couple of days ago, I noted that to stop the rally in
Treasury yields, the Fed would only need to express concern about the
negative impact of rising US debt market rates on financial conditions.
As soon as Governor Lael Brainard expressed concerns about the Treasury
yield rally, the bond sell-offs slowed down, and the [EURUSD][1] price
went up.

It should be noted that the current levels of Treasury yields are
attractive to foreign [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s. Currency-hedged Treasury yields have
hit the highest level since 2017. That is why foreign [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are
willing to buy US bonds, which calms down the market.

Of course, the bond market has not been fully stabilized. Investors are
concerned about two questions. Will the Treasury yield surge amid the US
strong PMI and employment data, strengthening the US dollar? Will other
FOMC members change the tone in their speeches in the first week of
March?

### Weekly [EURUSD][1] trading plan

Even if the Treasury yields continue rising, the euro bulls should not
be discouraged; it is only essential that they should not grow as fast
as they did in late February. The [EURUSD][1] has consolidated at the
lower border of the consolidation range 1.2-1.22, so it could resume the
uptrend. Continue focus on purchases, closely monitoring the tests of
the resistances at 1.21 and 1.2125.
