Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 03.03.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

The main target of the oil short-term downtrend, Target Zone [59.18 -
58.73], was reached. What's next?

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

Yesterday the WTI oil price was trading in the correction. Traders
tested the resistance of the intraday downtrend [60.58 - 60.47]. The
zone was not broken out. There was a price return under the level at the
US trading session. As a result, the Target Zone [59.18 - 58.73] was
reached.

Today begins with a price correction again. The short-term trend remains
down. Consider oil sales in the zone of [61.46 - 60.82]. Use the day's
low as a target.

Breakout of the Target Zone will allow the price to drop to the Gold
Zone [56.92 - 56.69].

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

Sell from the zone of [61.46 - 60.82]. TakeProfit: 58.73. StopLoss:
62.15.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

Gold updated last week's low at the market opening yesterday. The bears
tried to consolidate the price below the support Gold Zone [1725 -
1720], but their attempts failed. The price returned to the support zone
and went into a correction.

Today, watch the price stop in the Additional Zone [1737 - 1734]. A
pattern is necessary for opening new sales according to the short-term
trend. The price must return below the level of 1733 to form a pattern.

Otherwise, when AZ is broken out, the intraday trend will reverse up.
This will allow considering purchases up to the Intermediary Zone [1767
- 1762].

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

Sell according to the pattern in Additional Zone [1737 - 1734].
TakeProfit: 1708. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

Gold Zone [1.2002 - 1.1994] was reached yesterday within the short-term
downtrend. After reaching support, the strongest downward impulse that
began on February 25 was stopped for a while.

Yesterday, traders sent the euro price into correction and reached the
trend border [1.2079 - 1.2071]. An attempt to break out the zone was
failed. Now, before the European session, the price is returning to the
resistance zone.

Today's traders' goal is to look for the euro sales according to the
pattern in the Intermediary Zone with the target at yesterday's low.

Consider the euro purchases if today or tomorrow a breakout of the IZ
occurs and the price closes above 1.2091.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

Sell according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone [1.2079 - 1.2071].
TakeProfit: 1.1995. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.
