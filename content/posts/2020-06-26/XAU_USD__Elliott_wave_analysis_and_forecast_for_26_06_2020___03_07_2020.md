XAU/USD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 26/06/2020 –
03/07/2020Alex Geuta

## [XAU/USD][1] remains likely to grow. Estimated pivot point is at a
level of 1746.00.

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions from corrections above the
level of 1746.00 with a target of 1800.00 – 1850.00.

 **Alternative scenario:** Breakout and consolidation below the level of
1746.00 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of
1704.32 – 1670.86.

 **Analysis:** Supposedly, an ascending correction of larger degree
continues developing in the form of wave (B) on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame,
with wave С of (B) forming within. On the H4 time frame, supposedly, the
fifth wave v of C is forming, with the local correction completed inside
in the form of wave  (iv) of C . The third wave of smaller degree  iii
of (v) is forming on the H1 time frame. If the assumption is correct,
the price will continue growing to 1800.00 – 1850.00. The level of
1746.00 is critical in this scenario as the breakout will enable the
pair to continue declining to the levels of 1704.32 – 1670.86.
