Weekly forecast for oil, gold and EUR/USDAlex Rodiоnov

###  **USCrude – oil**

This week, the oil price has reached Target Zone 5 [41.67 -  40.92], the
main buy target in the middle-term uptrend.

Buyers have not broken out the resistance, and the price has rolled
down. The oil price is being corrected down. The possible target of the
correction is the trend key support [33.64 — 32.86].

When the key support is reached by the price, I recommend entering new
purchases according to the pattern with the target to break through the
high of this week.

Aggressive traders may consider sell trades in the correction with the
target at the lower Target Zone, there is a sell pattern in shorter
timeframes.

###  **XAUUSD – gold**

I congratulate those who have followed my recommendations to buy gold
and held the trades up to the target! The gold price has reached level
1765.0 and broken through the May’s high this week.

All purchases should be closed now as the buyers are trying to break out
the strong resistance Target Zone 5 [1757.2 - 1751.2]. If they do, the
nest upside target will be Target Zone 6 [1817.2 – 1811.2]. If they
fail, the price will be corrected down.

If the price is being corrected down, one may consider sell trades in
the short-term timeframe. However, the medium-term trend will be up
until the key support is broken out downside.

###  **EURUSD – euro/dollar**

In the previous weekly analytics, I wrote:

“The EUR/USD is testing the key support of the middle-term uptrend
[1.1240 – 1.1222]. Yesterday, the US session closed below the zone for
the first time. If the US session closes below level 1.1222 again today
or next week, we shall record the support breakout and start selling the
EUR/USD on the next trading day with the target at Target Zone 2 [1.1058
– 1.1040]. ”

On the same day, last Friday, the US session closed the EURUSD below
Target Zone [1.1240 – 1.1222] for the second time. The middle-term trend
turned down.

This week, the euro-dollar price tested the key resistance of the new
downtrend at 1.1368 – 1.1350], and the sellers reacted.

In the new down momentum, the price has quickly reached the previous
strong support [1.1240 – 1.1222]. Traders are now trying to again
consolidate the price below the zone and break through the low of last
week.

The trading ideas for next week are as follows:

  1. If the support at [1.1240 – 1.1222] is held up, it will be relevant to buy the euro with the target to break through the high of this week.
  2. If the low of last week is broken through, we shall move the resistance and enter new sell trades in the zone.

 **[EURUSD][6]  Trading tips for the upcoming week: **

  1. Buy according to the pattern in Target Zone [1.1240 - 1.1222]. TakeProfit: 1.1350. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. If the low of last week is broken through, sell on the correction in the key resistance zone. More detailed information is written in the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) analytics.
