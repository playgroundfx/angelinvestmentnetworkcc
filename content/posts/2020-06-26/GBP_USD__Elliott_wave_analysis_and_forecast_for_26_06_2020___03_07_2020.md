GBP/USD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 26/06/2020 –
03/07/2020Alex Geuta

## The pair [GBP/USD][1] remains likely to grow. Estimated pivot point
is at a level of 1.2333.

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions from corrections above the
level of  1.2333 with a target of 1.2880 – 1.3150.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
1.2350 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of 1.2069
– 1.1635.

 **Analysis:** Supposedly, the fifth wave of larger degree V finished
developing on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame, with wave  (С) of V completed and
the first wave (1) developing inside. On the H4 time frame, wave 1 of
(1) formed, a correction is completed in the form of wave 2 of (1), and
wave 3 of (1) started developing. On the H1 time frame, apparently, the
first wave of junior level i of 3 formed and a local correction is
completed in the form of wave ii of 3. If the presumption is correct,
the pair will continue to rise to the levels of 1.2880 – 1.3150. The
level of 1.2333 is critical in this scenario as the breakout will enable
the pair to continue declining to the levels of 1.2069 – 1.1635.
