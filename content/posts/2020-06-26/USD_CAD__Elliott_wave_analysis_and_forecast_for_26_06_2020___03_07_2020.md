USD/CAD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 26/06/2020 –
03/07/2020Alex Geuta

## [USD/CAD][1] remains likely to grow. Estimated pivot point is at a
level of 1.3481.

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions from corrections above the
level of 1.3481 with a target of 1.3875 – 1.4047.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
1.3481 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of 1.3189
– 1.2948.

 **Analysis:** On the D1 time frame, supposedly a descending correction
finished developing in the form of second wave of larger degree (2), and
wave (3) started forming. On the 4-hour time frame, a descending
correction finished developing in the form of wave 2 of (3) and wave 3
of (3) started forming, with wave i of 3 forming inside. Apparently, the
wave (iii) of i is developing on the H1 time frame.  If this assumption
is correct, the pair will continue to rise to 1.3875 – 1.4047. The level
of 1.3481 is critical in this scenario as the breakout will enable the
pair to continue declining to the levels of 1.3189 – 1.2948.
