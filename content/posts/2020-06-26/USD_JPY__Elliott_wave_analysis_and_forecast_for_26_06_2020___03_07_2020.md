USD/JPY: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 26/06/2020 –
03/07/2020Alex Geuta

## [USD/JPY][1] remains likely to fall. Estimated pivot point is at a
level of 107.82.

 **Main scenario:** consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 107.82 with a target of 105.21 – 104.50.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
107.82 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 108.60 –
109.84.

 **Analysis:** On the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame, apparently a descending
correction of larger degree finished forming as wave B and wave С
started developing. On the H4 time frame, the first wave 1 of (1) of C
formed and a local correction continues forming as wave 2 of (1).
Apparently, wave c of 2 is developing on the H1 time frame, with a
corrective wave (ii) of c completed and wave (iii) of c forming inside.
If the presumption is correct, the pair will continue to drop to the
levels of 105.21 – 104.50. The level of 107.82 is critical in this
scenario as the breakout will enable the pair to continue growing to the
levels of 108.60 – 109.84.
