USD/CHF: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 26/06/2020 –
03/07/2020Alex Geuta

## [USD/CHF][1] remains likely to fall. Estimated pivot point is at a
level of 0.9530.

 **Main scenario:** consider short positions from corrections below the
level of  0.9530 with a target of 0.9323 – 0.9170.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
0.9530 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 0.9651 –
0.9781.

 **Analysis:** Supposedly, the descending third wave of larger degree
(3) continues developing on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame, with wave 1 of (3)
forming inside. On the H4 time frame, wave v of 1 is forming, with wave
(iii) of v forming inside. On the H1 time frame, apparently a local
correction finished developing as wave  iv of (iii) and wave v of (iii)
is forming. If the presumption is correct, the pair will continue to
drop to the levels of  0.9323 – 0.9170. The level of  0.9530 is critical
in this scenario. Its breakout will allow the pair to continue rising to
the levels of 0.9651 – 0.9781.
