The BTCUSD market is forming the large corrective wave 4 as a double
zigzag [W]-[X]-[Y]. There is now developing the linking wave [X] that
also can complete as an upward double zigzag (W)-(X)-(Y). Wave (W) is a
simple zigzag, the linking wave (X) is a double zigzag, wave (Y) is a
zigzag that has not yet completed. Let study the most recent zigzag in
more detail in a shorter timeframe.

It is clear from the eight-hour timeframe that, after the linking down
wave (X) completed, the market has started forming the impulse wave A
that is an element of the upward zigzag (Y). Wave A is composed of five
sub-waves [1]-[2]-[3]-[4]-[5], where corrective wave [4] is likely to be
a horizontal contracting triangle. When the entire corrective wave 4
completes at a level of around 8960 that is the level of the lower
construction line, the price can start rising in the upward impulse [5]
towards the level of 11000.
