Analysis for oil, gold, and EUR/USD for 01.06.2020Alex Rodiоnov

###  **USCrude –** **oil** ****

Oil traders are trying to break out the strong resistance Target Zone 4
[34.17 – 33.42] in the middle-term uptrend. If buyers succeed, the next
upside target will be Target Zone 5 [41.67 — 40.92].

![LiteForex: Analysis for oil, gold, and EUR/USD for 01.06.2020][1]

The short-term trend is up. It is clear from the shorter timeframe that
bulls are testing Target Zone 4 [34.17 – 33.42]. If the US session
closes the price above the resistance, the next target in the uptrend
will be Gold Zone 4 [37.55 – 37.17].

If the price is corrected down, we shall consider the strong supports,
Additional Zone [32.73 – 32.51], and Intermediary Zone [30.48 - 30.03].
We shall enter purchases in these zones. The target will be to break
through the local high.

 **[USCrude][3]Trading ideas for today:  **

  1. Buy according to the pattern in Additional Zone [32.73 - 32.51]. TakeProfit: 35.00. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. Buy according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone [30.48 - 30.03]. TakeProfit: 35.00. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

###  **XAUUSD – gold**

In the longer timeframe, the gold price is being corrected down in the
middle-term downtrend. The correction target is to test Target Zone
[1673.6 – 1664.4].

There is also an alternative scenario. The price can break out Target
Zone 5 and consolidate above. In this case, we shall enter middle-term
purchases with the target at Target Zone 6 [1817.2 — 1811.2].

The gold local short-term trend is down. Last week, the price broke out
Intermediary Zone [1719.3 - 1714.8]. Therefore, the next downside target
for this week is Target Zone [1673.6 - 1664.4].

The price is now being corrected up towards the trend key resistance
[1744.0 – 1739.4]. I recommend selling gold in this zone.

 **[XAUUSD][6] Trading ideas for today:  **

Sell according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone [1744.0 - 1739.4].
TakeProfit: Target Zone [1673.6 - 1664.4]. StopLoss: according to the
pattern rules.

###  **EURUSD – euro/dollar**

The EURUSD middle-term trend continues. Bulls are trying to break out
Target Zone 2 [1.1109 – 1.1091]. If they succeed, the next upside target
will be Target Zone 3 [1.1291 – 1.1273].

This week, I recommend expecting a correction down and entering new
purchases in the trend key support zone [1.0968 — 1.0950].

![LiteForex: Analysis for oil, gold, and EUR/USD for 01.06.2020][7]

In the shorter timeframe, the price has reached Gold Zone [1.1152 –
1.1143]. This is strong resistance to the short-term uptrend. If the
resistance is broken out with the consolidation above, the next upside
target will be Target Zone 2 [1.1252 - 1.1234].

Otherwise, the price will be corrected down to the trend key support
[1.1059 – 1.1050]. One can enter buy trades according to the pattern in
the support zone.

![LiteForex: Analysis for oil, gold, and EUR/USD for 01.06.2020][8]

 **[EURUSD][9] Trading ideas for today: **

Buy according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone [1.1059 - 1.1050].
TakeProfit: 1.1150. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

> IZ - Intermediary Zone: responsible for the price momentum reversing

>

> TZ - Target Zone: a zone that is 75% likely to be reached after IZ
breakout.

>

> GZ - Gold Zone: zone in the medium-term momentum.

>

> All zones are calculated based on the average [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) price of the
instrument and margin requirements of the futures.
