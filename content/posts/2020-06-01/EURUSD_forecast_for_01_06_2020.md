Dollar is tinkering at the marginsDmitri Demidenko

## The EUR/USD bears were not encouraged by the White House’s
retaliation to China for Hong Kong

Forex has been radically changed by the global recession! In a different
situation, the talks about the expansion of the euro-area QE would
result in the euro sell-offs. Under the current conditions, the
[EUR/USD][1] has reached its two-month high also because [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s
expect the ECB to take new measures to support the euro-area economy. If
Christine Lagarde and her colleagues add to the quantitative easing at
least €500 billion, Italy’s bonds may perform the best four-week rally
since 2003. The drop in the Italian bond yields will signal that the
euro-area debt market is calming down.

The ECB meeting is the key event at the beginning of summer. The members
of the Governing Council talked a lot about the necessity if the QE
boosting in May, and the market has been almost convinced that the ECB
would drive the QE size to €1.6 trillion. According to Christine
Lagarde, the previous forecast suggesting the euro-area GDP drop by 5%
in 2020, has been out of date by now. The euro-area economy can slip by
8%-12% down. A worse economic outlook, in addition to the inflation
slowdown to 0.1% in the euro area, is a good reason to ease the monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). Even Germany’s constitutional court can’t prevent the ECB from
this. The ECB is accountable to the European Parliament and is guided by
the decisions of the European Court of Justice, which recognized QE as a
legitimate program.

The stabilization of the European debt market is an important growth
driver for the [EUR/USD][1]. A narrower gap between the Italian and
German bond yields signals that the political risks are easing in the
euro area and the EU is getting more united. For example, the euro
surged after  Emmanuel Macron won a battle with Eurosceptic parties in
2017, so the unity among the EU members is crucial for the euro’s
future.

Of course, the [EUR/USD][1] rally wouldn’t be so impressive but for the
rally of the S&P 500, which encouraged [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s to sell safe havens.
The US economy may seem to be in a deep recession. Consumer spending
fell 13.6% in April, following a 6.9% drop in March. Bloomberg experts
predict the US non-farm payrolls should contract by another 8 million,
after losing 20.5 million in April. US unemployment should increase to
19.5%, the highest level since the Great Depression. Nevertheless,
Jerome Powell says he is less concerned than he was in late February and
early March, the low base effect supports the hope for the V-shaped
recovery of the US GDP in the second half of 2020. So, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s, who
bought US shares in April and May, see that they were right and are
willing to continue buying the US stocks.

Under the current conditions, the S&P 500 sell-off may start only if the
[news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) is really bad. The market expected bad [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) to result from the US
huge sanctions against China, as it has approved the national security
bill for Hong Kong. However, the White House hasn’t taken radical
measures, which encourages the euro bulls. If the [EUR/USD][1]
successfully tests the resistance at 1.115, it can well continue the
rally towards 1.122 and 1.124.
