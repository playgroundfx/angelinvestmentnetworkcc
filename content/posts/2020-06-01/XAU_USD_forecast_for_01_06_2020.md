Gold: the pandemic starts and ends, but the liquidity remainsDmitri
Demidenko

## The way the Fed follows the experience of other central banks will
determine the gold future trend

I am entertained with the headlines of the articles devoted to the gold
market. Something like “Gold is down amid the reopening of the US
economy and the rally of stock indexes”, “Gold price is rising as
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are concerned that Trump will take serious measures against
China as the retaliation for Hong Kong”. The US didn’t impose tough
sanctions against China, but the [XAU/USD][1] is still rising. Why? They
say this is because of the riots in the US after the killing of an
African American by the police. But the US stocks are still growing!
Yes, because [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s ignore those protests. I remember an old joke
about two analysts speaking:

>  Do you understand what is happening in the market?

>

> \- Yes, let me explain…

>

> \- No, thanks! I can explain this myself, but I still can’t
understand...

In my opinion, such controversial headlines of the tabloids, like there
were two or three days ago, occur because their authors do not
understand what is really going on. I will try to express my own
opinion, which, however, may not be the universal truth.

The price of any asset forms also because of the actions of big traders
that are based on an investment idea. In most cases, this is an idea
suggested by fundamental factors. Besides, the patterns in economic
studies are as often as the technical patterns. The global economy is in
the recession, so we can base on the gold trends that were typical
during the former downturns. At those times, the market favored the idea
that the inflation rise, spurred by the huge monetary stimulus, would
push the gold future up above $2000 per once. The time was going, the
gold price was growing and reached its all-time high at $1920 in 2011.
However, the CPI and the PCE didn’t accelerate. Big traders realized
that they had been wrong and started exiting longs, which broke the
[XAU/USD][1] bull trend.

History is not only repeated but also rhymed. The current monetary
stimulus is greater than the previous one, however, banks and hedge
funds are unwilling to repeat the old mistake, so they started exiting
longs in late May. This is because inflation is not rising. Moreover,
the demand can be weak for a long time due to the pandemic, which is
clear from the dynamics of 10-year inflation expectations.

As a result, the gold price rebounded from the top of the middle-term
consolidation range of $1635-$1775 outlined in the [previous gold
analytics][3].

If the price hadn’t remained above $1700, the correction could have
continued. However, the Fed’s officials started talking about the yield
curve control. According to t _he_ president of the Federal Reserve Bank
of New York John Williams, this idea is being considered, and the
experience of other countries is being analyzed. If the central bank
keeps the bond market rates at a fixed level, the inflation rate should
start rising (the pandemic starts and ends, but the liquidity remains).
This will send down the real Treasury yield, and the gold price should
be rising to at least $1830 per ounce. The US Treasuries are the main
rival for gold, and a drop in Treasury yields encourages [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s to
increase the share of gold in the portfolios.
