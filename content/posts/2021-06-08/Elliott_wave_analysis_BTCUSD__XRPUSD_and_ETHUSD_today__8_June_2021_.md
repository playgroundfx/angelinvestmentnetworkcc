Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 08.06.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

Bitcoin and Ethereum markets are forming corrective zigzag waves within
bearish impulses. It seems that the unfolding of the final sub-waves of
these corrections has begun.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

The most recent BTCUSD chart section displays the construction of an
upward corrective wave [2]. Perhaps it takes the form of a simple zigzag
(A) - (B) - (C), where (A) and (C) are impulses, and (B) is a horizontal
corrective wave in the shape of a contracting triangle A-B-C-D-E. Most
likely, the market has completed the last wave E of this triangle as a
zigzag [A] - [B] - [C]. Thus, in the near future, the price may start
moving up within wave (C), which may likely unfolding as a simple
zigzag. The target, at which wave (C) is expected to end, is located at
level 44500.00. At this level, wave [2] will be 50% of wave [1].

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 33505.32, TP 44500.00

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

The XRPUSD market is developing an upward linking wave (X) as a simple
zigzag A-B-C. It seems that the corrective wave B has been completed.
This correction took the form of a double zigzag [W] - [X] - [Y]. Sub-
waves [W] and [Y] are double zigzags, linking wave [X] is a simple
zigzag. Thus, shortly, the price may move upward within an impulse wave
C to the level of 1.153. At this level, wave (X) will reach the
Fibonacci level of 38.2% of the current bear wave (W).

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] today:

Buy 0.858, TP 1.153

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

The ETHUSD market is likely unfolding an upward corrective wave 2 as a
simple zigzag [A] - [B] - [C]. The hourly timeframe displays the
completed impulse wave [A] and also the bear correction [B], which is a
double zigzag. Sub-wave (5), which is the last part of the impulse wave
[C], is still unfolding, as the corrective wave (4) looks completed with
sub-waves W-X-Y-XX-Z. It is assumed that within wave (5) prices will
rise to the level of 3340.00. At this level, wave 2 will reach the
Fibonacci level of 61.8% of wave 1.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Buy 2578.17, TP 3340.00
