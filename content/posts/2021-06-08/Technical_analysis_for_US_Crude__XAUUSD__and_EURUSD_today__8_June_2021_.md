Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 08.06.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

Oil price is testing the Additional Zone 68.51 - 68.38 within the short-
term uptrend.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

Oil price is testing the Additional Zone 68.51 - 68.38 within the short-
term uptrend. If a buy pattern is formed, I recommend entering trades
according to the pattern with a target at yesterday's high.

If the Additional Zone is broken out, the short-term trend will reverse
down, so it would be reasonable to sell oil with the target in the
Intermediary Zone 67.18 - 66.92.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

Buy according to the pattern in Additional Zone 68.51 - 68.38.
TakeProfit: 69.81. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

Gold has worked out the priority bullish pattern, reaching the Target
Zone 1905 - 1901. The price is correcting in the short-term uptrend. The
target of the correction is the Additional Zone 1892 - 1890. After the
test of the Additional Zone, look for purchases according to the pattern
with the target at the day's high.

If the Additional Zone is broken out, the correction will continue, and
the sellers' target will be the Intermediary Zone 1880 - 1878.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

Buy according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 1892 - 1890.
TakeProfit: 1903. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

Yesterday, the euro price tested the Intermediary Zone 1.2200 - 1.2192.
This zone serves as the short-term downtrend's key resistance. Today, it
is profitable to look for sales according to the pattern in the
Intermediary Zone with the target at the Target Zone 1.2090 - 1.2072.

To form a false breakout pattern, sellers need to break out the support
level of 1.2152.

An alternative buy option is the breakout of the Intermediary Zone and
price consolidation higher at the US trading session. In this case, the
short-term trend will reverse up, and the target will be the upper
Target zone 1.2297 - 1.2280.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

Sell according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 1.2200 - 1.2192.
TakeProfit: Target Zone 1.2090 - 1.2072. StopLoss: according to the
pattern rules.
