USDCHF:Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 23.10.20 - 30.10.20Alex
Geuta

 **Main scenario:** Consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 0.9165 with a target of 0.8900 – 0.8800.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
0.9165 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 0.9295 –
0.9398.

 **Analysis:** Daily time frame: presumably, a descending third wave of
larger degree (3) continues developing, with wave 1 of (3) forming
inside. Wave v of 1 is developing on the H4 time frame. Wave (iii) of v
formed and a local correction developed in the form of wave (iv) of v
inside wave v of 1. H1 time frame: apparently, wave (v) of v is
developing, with wave iii of (v) of smaller degree forming inside. If
the presumption is correct, the pair will continue to drop to the levels
of 0.8900 – 0.8800. The level of 0.9165 is critical in this scenario.
Its breakout will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of
0.9295 – 0.9398.
