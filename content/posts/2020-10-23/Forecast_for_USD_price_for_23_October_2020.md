No illusions for dollar. Forecast for 23.10.2020Dmitri Demidenko

A blue wave is more and more likely to happen, but the greenback is
growing ahead of the EU business activity data publication. How will the
[EURUSD][1] react to bad stats? Let’s find it out and make a trading
plan.

## Fundamental forecast for dollar for today

The markets are tired of the US fiscal stimulus story and want to “play
uncertainty” ahead of the US presidential election. Together with US
strong macrostatistics, that made [EURUSD][1]’s quotes fall. My strategy
of [selling the pair from the levels of 1.185 and 1.181][2] is working
out, but don’t get carried away with it. Joe Biden’s victory prospects
are more and more clear. So is the euro’s bright future.

According to Morgan Stanley and JP Morgan, the democrats’ victory will
cut a risk of the US protectionist [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)’s second wave. That will have
a positive impact on the export-oriented eurozone and the local
currency. Deutsche Bank forecasts that the [EURUSD][1] will rally to 1.2
in case the White House has a new tenant.  Tax hikes, budget deficit
growth and lower trading tension will put pressure on the dollar as a
safe-haven asset. On the contrary, Trump’s unexpected victory will
support the greenback amid higher uncertainty and the risk of a new
trading war.

Despite the ratings and Biden’s confident looks during the last debates,
there’s still a chance of losing the race to the Republicans, as it
happened in 2016. So, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are not in a hurry for selling dollars.
What’s more, the US economy is showing a surprising resistance to the
pandemic: jobless claims are at their lowest since March, while sales in
the secondary housing market have soared to 14-year peaks.

New Covid cases grew to record highs in Europe, and Spain became the
first European country to have over 1 million of cases. That puts
pressure on the euro. Besides, the demand for the eurozone’s peripheral
bonds isn’t a high as expected: the Italian, Greek, and Portuguese bond
yield is growing, which means the ECB is unlikely to expand the asset-
buying program on 29 October. However, if the business activity data
turn out to be disappointing, QE expansion will be more probable, and
bond prices will grow too.

Even if the pandemic hit both demand and supply, the industrial sector
is recovering faster. Its share in Germany’s and Italy’s GDPs (21% and
17%) is higher than in France and Spain (12% and 11%), so Germany and
Italy are supposed to feel better.

 **Trading plan for**[ **EURUSD**][1] **for today**

Traders are more interested in the [EURUSD][1]’s reaction to October’s
business activity statistics. There are fears that actual data may turn
out worse than Bloomberg’s forecasts because of the second coronavirus
wave. At the same time, the euro’s fall ahead of the important releases
lets us presume that negative [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) have already been factored in quotes
in part. So, there will be an opportunity to buy the regional currency
after a slight drawdown. I think the bears’ inability to draw the pair
below 1.177-1.178 will point to their weakness and allow us to go long
at a breakout.
