USDCAD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 23.10.20 – 30.10.20Alex
Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 1.3258 with a target of 1.2991 – 1.2800.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
1.3258 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 1.3420 –
1.3500.

 **Analysis:** Daily time frame: wave (С) of 4 of larger degree
continues developing, with the first wave 1 of (C) formed inside. H4
time frame: a local correction has finished developing in the form of
wave 2 of (C), and wave 3 of (5) started forming. Apparently, the first
wave of smaller degree i of 3 is developing on the H1 time frame. If
this assumption is correct, the pair will continue to fall to the levels
of 1.2991 – 1.2800. The level of 1.3258 is critical in this scenario, as
the breakout will enable the pair to continue rising to the levels of
1.3420 – 1.3500.
