Economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the week 16.11.2020 – 22.11.2020Jana Kane

##  **Review of the main events of the Forex economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the
next trading week (16.11.2020 – 22.11.2020)**

 **Trading on key Forex [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/): next week we are expecting the publication
of important macro statistics from China, the US, Great Britain, Canada,
Australia, as well as statements by the heads of the central banks of
Australia, Great Britain, and Canada.**

Following an extremely turbulent and volatile week, the dollar index,
which reflects the value of the dollar against a basket of 6 major
currencies, went up. But the main US stock indexes ended the week in
different directions. While the S&P 500 and DJIA rallied, the Nasdaq100
declined last week because the [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) sentiment shifted as [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/)
emerged regarding a coronavirus vaccine and the likelihood of an
unexpected US election outcome. Trump did not admit defeat and announced
his intention to sue regarding the counting of votes, since, in his
opinion, there were numerous violations by Democrats in the elections.
At the same time, the Speaker of the House of Representatives of the US
Congress Nancy Pelosi pointed to the lack of any progress in
negotiations with the White House on a new stimulus package for the
American economy affected by the novel coronavirus pandemic. The dollar,
which is in demand as a defensive asset, strengthened again against the
yen and the euro, while gold fell in price, having lost more than $60
per ounce over the week.

Next week, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s will pay attention to the publication of important
macro statistics from China, the US, the UK, Canada, Australia, as well
as to the speeches of the heads of the central banks of Australia, Great
Britain and Canada.

 **Traders should pay attention to the publication of the following
macro indicators:**

 ***during the coming week, new events may be added to the [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) and
/ or some scheduled events may be canceled**

 ****** **GMT time**

###  **Monday, November 16**

###  **02:00** **CNY Retail Sales Index**

This index is published monthly by the National Bureau of Statistics of
China and measures total retail sales and cash receipts. The index is
often considered an indicator of consumer confidence and economic well-
being and reflects the health of the retail sector in the near term. A
rise in the index is usually positive for the CNY; a decrease in the
indicator will negatively affect the CNY. The previous value of the
index (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) was +3.3% (after an increase of +8% in the last
months of 2019 and a fall of -20.5% in February 2020). Forecast: In
October, retail sales rose in China by +5.0% (on an annualized basis),
which indicates an intensifying recovery after a strong fall in
February-March this year. If the data turns out to be even better, the
CNY will strengthen even more.

###  **08:40 AUD Speech by head of the RBA Philip Lowe**

In his speech, Philip Lowe will assess the current situation in the
Australian economy and point out further plans for the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
of his agency. Any signals from him regarding a change in the plans of
the RBA's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) will cause a sharp increase in volatility in
the AUD trading and on the Australian stock market.

During its regular meeting in early November, the RB of Australia
lowered its interest rate and expanded its stimulus program for the
Australian economy (the bank lowered its key rate and target yield on
3-year bonds to 0.10% from 0.25% and announced a quantitative easing
program in the amount of 100 billion Australian dollars).

The RBA head Philip Lowe said the bank found it necessary to further
bolster demand and accelerate recovery in the pandemic-hit labor market.

Lowe is likely to once again sum up the results of the last RBA meeting
and announce the bank's future plans.

If he does not touch on the topic of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), the market
reaction to his speech will be weak.

###  **Tuesday, November 17**

###  **00:30 AUD Minutes of the November meeting of the Reserve Bank of
Australia**

This document is published two weeks after the meeting and the decision
on the interest rate. If the RBA positively assesses the state of the
labor market in the country, GDP growth rates, and also shows a hawkish
attitude towards the inflation forecast in the economy, the markets
regard this as a higher probability of a rate hike at the next meeting,
which is a positive factor for the AUD. The bank's soft rhetoric
regarding, above all, inflation puts pressure on the AUD.

At the meeting in early November, the central bank lowered its key rate
and target for 3-year bonds to 0.10% from 0.25% and announced A$ 100
billion in quantitative easing to support the Australian economy amid a
sharp slowdown.

“The economic recovery will be uneven and unstable,” and “unemployment
may remain high for a long time,” said the leaders of the RBA after one
of the last meetings of the bank, promising that “the rate will not rise
until the Central Bank sees progress in moving towards full employment
and stable inflation rates in the 2-3% range”.

According to RBA head Philip Lowe, "there are no serious arguments in
favor of tightening monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) in the short term," and "some time
will pass before interest rates rise."

Nevertheless, if the published minutes contain unexpected information
regarding the RBA's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), the volatility in the AUD quotes
will increase.

###  **13:30 USD Retail sales (ex autos). Retail control group**

This report (Core Retail Sales Ex Autos) reflects the total sales of
retailers of all sizes and types, excluding car dealerships. Changes in
retail sales are the main indicator of consumer spending. The report is
a leading indicator, and in the future, the data may be greatly revised.
A high result strengthens the US dollar, a low one weakens it. A
relative decrease in the indicator may have a short-term negative impact
on the dollar, while an increase in the indicator will have a positive
effect on the USD. In the previous month (September), the indicator
increased by +1.5% (against a decline of -17.2% in April, -4.5% in
March, -0.4% in February). Forecast for October: +0.6%.

Retail sales is the leading indicator of consumer spending in the United
States, showing changes in retail sales. The Retail Control Group metric
measures volume across the entire retail industry and is used to
calculate price indices for most products. A strong result strengthens
the US dollar, and vice versa, a weak report weakens the dollar. A
slight increase in indicators is unlikely to accelerate the growth of
the dollar. The data worse than the values ​​of the previous period
(+1.4% in September, -0.1% in August, +1.4% in July) may negatively
affect the dollar in the short term.

Forecast for October: +0.5%.

###  **14:00** **GBP Speech by head of the Bank of England Andrew
Bailey**

In his speech, Andrew Bailey will probably touch upon the state and
prospects of the British economy, which has been badly affected by the
coronavirus pandemic and is on the verge of Brexit, which can still
happen without a deal.

Participants of financial markets will also expect him to clarify the
situation regarding the further [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the central bank of Great
Britain. If Andrew Bailey gives any hints about tightening or easing of
the Bank of England's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) in the near future, then
volatility during his speech will sharply increase in the quotes of the
pound and the London Stock Exchange FTSE index. If he does not touch
upon the issues of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), the reaction to his speech will be
weak.

###  **19:00 CAD Speech by head of the Bank of Canada Tiff Macklem**

Tiff Macklem succeeded Stephen Poloz as Governor of the Bank of Canada,
becoming Chairman on June 3, 2020. Macklem faces essentially the same
tasks as his predecessor on this post.

The Canadian economy, as well as the entire global economy, is showing
signs of a slowdown in the first half of this year, driven by the
downturn in business due to the coronavirus pandemic. Earlier this year,
Stephen Poloz said that the Canadian economy is robust enough to keep
rates unchanged despite the worsening global economy. However, the
situation is changing rapidly, and not for the better. It will be
interesting now to listen to Maclem's opinion on the stability of the
Canadian economy and the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the central bank.

If Tiff Macklem touches on the topic of the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the Bank
of Canada, the volatility in the quotes of the Canadian dollar will rise
sharply. His tough tone will help strengthen the Canadian dollar. The
soft rhetoric of Macklem's speech and the intention to pursue soft
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) will negatively affect the CAD quotes.

He may also provide some guidelines for [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s on the eve of the next
meeting of the Bank of Canada, which will be held on December 9.

###  **22:00 AUD Speech by head of the RBA Philip Lowe**

In his speech, Philip Lowe will assess the current situation in the
Australian economy and point out further plans for the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
of his agency. Any signals from him regarding a change in the plans of
the RBA's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) will cause a sharp increase in volatility in
the AUD trading and on the Australian stock market.

Lowe is likely to once again sum up the results of the last RBA meeting
and announce the bank's future plans.

If he does not touch on the topic of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), the market
reaction to his speech will be weak.

###  **Wednesday, November 18**

###  **07:00 GBP Consumer Price Index. Core Consumer Price Index**

Consumer Price Index (CPI) reflects the dynamics of retail prices for a
group of goods and services that make up the British consumer basket.
The CPI is a key indicator of inflation. Its publication will cause
active movement of the pound in the foreign exchange market, as well as
the London Stock Exchange FTSE100 index.

In the previous reporting month (September), the growth in consumer
inflation (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) amounted to +0.5%.

Outlook for October: +0.6% (annualized). This value is unlikely to
provide significant support to the pound. Indicator value below the
forecast could provoke a weakening of the pound, as low inflation will
force the Bank of England to adhere to a soft monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).

Core CPI is published by the Office for National Statistics and
determines the price change of a selected basket of goods and services
(excluding food and energy) for a given period. It is a key indicator
for assessing inflation and changes in purchasing preferences. A
positive result strengthens the GBP, a negative result weakens it.

In September, Core CPI (on an annualized basis) increased by +1.3%. The
publication of the indicator is likely to have a positive effect on the
pound if its value is higher than the forecast and the previous value.
Forecast for October: +1.3% (annualized). The indicator value below the
forecast and previous values ​​may provoke a weakening of the pound.

###  **13:30 CAD Consumer Price Indices in Canada**

Core Consumer Price Index (Core CPI) from the Bank of Canada reflects
the dynamics of the retail prices of the corresponding basket of goods
and services (excluding fruits, vegetables, gasoline, fuel oil, natural
gas, mortgage interest, intercity transportation, and tobacco products).
The inflation target for the Bank of Canada is in the range of 1-3%. The
rise in CPI is a harbinger of a rate hike and a positive factor for the
CAD. Core Consumer Price Index rose in September by +1.0% (in annual
[terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)). If the October data turns out to be worse than the previous
values, it will negatively affect the CAD. Better-than-forecast data and
above previous values ​​will strengthen the Canadian dollar.

Forecast for October: Core CPI will come out with a value of +0.9% (in
annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)).

###  **Thursday, November 19**

###  **00:30 AUD Employment rate. Unemployment rate**

Employment rate reflects the monthly change in the number of Australian
citizens employed. The growth of the indicator has a positive impact on
consumer spending, which stimulates economic growth. A high reading is
positive for the AUD, while a low reading is negative. Forecast: in
October, the number of employed Australian citizens fell by another
-30,000 (after falling in April by 607,400, in May by 264,100 and by
29,500 in September).

Also at the same time, the Australian Bureau of Statistics will publish
a report on the unemployment rate - an indicator that estimates the
ratio of the unemployed population to the total number of able-bodied
citizens. The growth of the indicator indicates the weakness of the
labor market, which leads to a weakening of the national economy. The
decline in the indicator is a positive factor for the AUD. Forecast:
unemployment in Australia in October was at 7.2% (against 6.9% in
September, 6.8% in August, 7.5% in July, 7.4% in June, 5.2% in March ,
5.1% in February). In general, the indicators cannot be described as
positive yet. However, in other large economies, the labor market has
deteriorated on an even larger scale due to the coronavirus.

The leaders of the RBA have repeatedly stated that, in addition to the
situation in international trade, the Australian economy and the central
bank's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) plans are influenced by the indicators of the
level of household debt and expenditures, the growth of workers' wages,
as well as the state of the country's labor market.

In November 2020, the RB of Australia cut its key interest rate by
another 0.15%, to a new all-time low of 0.1%, due to the coronavirus. In
the opinion of the RBA management, an unemployment rate of 4.5% or lower
is required to raise wages and accelerate inflation to the target range.
Unemployment in the country is not declining, and a return of inflation
to the middle of the target range of 2% -3% is not even on the distant
horizon.

The AUD is unlikely to react positively to the publication of data from
the country's labor market. If the values ​​of the indicators turn out
to be worse than forecast, then the Australian dollar may significantly
decline in the short term. Better-than-expected data will strengthen AUD
in the short term.

###  **Friday, November 20**

###  **00:30** **AUD Retail Sales Index**

Retail Sales Index is published monthly by the Australian Bureau of
Statistics and measures total retail sales. The index is often
considered an indicator of consumer confidence and reflects the health
of the retail sector in the near term. Index growth is usually positive
for the AUD; a decrease in the indicator will negatively affect the AUD.
The previous value of the index (for September) was -1.1% after falling
by -17.7% in April. If the data for October turns out to be weaker than
the previous value, the AUD may sharply decline in the short term.

###  **01:30 CNY The People's Bank of China's decision on the interest
rate**

Since May 2012, the People's Bank of China has been steadily cutting
interest rates to support Chinese manufacturers. The last time the bank
cut the rate in April 2020 (by 0.20% to 3.85% at the moment).

In recent months, amid international trade conflicts and a slowdown in
the global economy, the world's largest central banks have been moving
towards softening their monetary policies in order to support national
economies and increase the competitiveness of goods exported from these
countries.

The People's Bank of China is also in line with this process. The
depreciation of the yuan became especially relevant in the last 2 years,
when the confrontation between the two most powerful economies in the
world began. One of the measures to neutralize the negative consequences
of the increased duties on the import of Chinese goods into the United
States was the depreciation of the national currency of China. This
measure was intended, among other things, to maintain the same volumes
of imports of Chinese products to the United States, which would cost
American buyers less due to the difference in the rates of the national
currencies of the United States and China.

Now, another strong negative factor has been added to this - the
coronavirus.

Probably, at this meeting, the People's Bank of China will keep the
interest rate at the same level of 3.85%, although a rate cut is also
possible.

Nevertheless, if the People's Bank of China makes unexpected statements
or decisions, then volatility may increase in the entire financial
market. Investors will also be interested in the bank's assessment of
the consequences of the coronavirus for the Chinese economy and its
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) in the near future in this regard.

###  **13:30 CAD Retail Sales Index**

Retail Sales Index is published monthly by Statistics Canada and
estimates total retail sales. The index is often considered an indicator
of consumer confidence and reflects the health of the retail sector in
the near term. A rise in the index is usually positive for the CAD; a
decrease in the indicator will negatively affect the CAD. The previous
value of the index (in August) was +0.4% after falling in March by
-9.9%, in April - by -25% and growth in May by +18.7%. If the data for
September turns out to be weaker than the previous value, the CAD may
decline in the short term.
