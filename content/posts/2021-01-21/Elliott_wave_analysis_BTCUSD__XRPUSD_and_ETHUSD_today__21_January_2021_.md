Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 21.01.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

Ethereum and Ripple are forming bearish corrective waves in the bullish
impulses. Bitcoin is developing a large triangle correction.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

The BTCUSD continues forming the bullish impulse. The first three legs
of the impulse have completed, and there is now forming the corrective
wave 4. The horizontal correction 4 is unfolding as a contracting
triangle [a]-[b]-[c]-[d]-[e]. Wave [c] may end at a level of 32750.00.
Next, the price will be rising in wave [d]. An approximate trajectory of
the Bitcoin future price movement is outlined in the chart. One could
consider sell trades with a target at the end of wave [c].

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Sell 34585.50 TP 32750.00

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

The hourly Ripple price chart shows the beginning of the bullish impulse
wave which will conclude the global upward zigzag A-B-C. There is
developing wave (1) as a five-wave impulse. There is unfolding
corrective wave 4, composed of the sub-waves, [W]-[X]-[Y], within
impulse (1). The double zigzag should end soon after a short impulse
wave (c) completes. Next, the price should start rising in wave 5. The
nearest target for purchases is the high made by wave 3, level 0.380.

### Trading plan for **[XRPUSD][2]** today:

Buy 0.293, TP 0.380

## Elliott wave Ethereum analysis

The ETHUSD market is forming the bullish impulse wave C, with the final
leg of impulse wave [5] developing inside. There is forming the upward
impulse 5 composed of the sub-waves [1]-[2]-[3]-[4]-[5]. Wave [3] has
recently completed, and there is now forming corrective wave [4]. Wave 4
should end as a simple zigzag (a)-(b)-(c). The (c) should be running
down to a level of 1202.00. Next, the Ethereum price will resume rising
in the final wave [5], which could end higher than wave [3], at a level
of around 1450.00.

### Trading plan for  **[ETHUSD][3] **today:

Sell 1322.61, TP 1202.00
