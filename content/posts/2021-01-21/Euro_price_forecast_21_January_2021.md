Euro reads between the lines. Forecast for 21.01.2021Dmitri Demidenko

Investors do not expect anything new from the European Central Bank.
This fact, as well as the return of the dollar bears and pleasant
surprises from the euro-area economy, could encourage the [EURUSD][1]
bulls to go ahead. Let us discuss the Forex outlook and make up a
trading plan.

## Fundamental Euro forecast today

People, who can earn money, can read between the lines. The US new
administration and Joe Biden may suggest an unwillingness to weaken the
dollar. However, the very fact of Janet Yellen's appointment to
theTreasury Secretary gives the green light to the greenback sellers. At
the press conference following the ECB's January meeting, Christine
Lagarde may repeat the mantra that the central bank is closely
monitoring the euro exchange rate. However, the repetition of the
previous wording will most likely contribute to the [EURUSD][1] growth.
It is simply because the ECB, after the pair’s correction, has fewer
reasons to worry about the euro’s appreciation than in December.

The [S&P 500][2] bulls correctly interpreted Joe Biden’s call for
national unity. The new US president is preparing Congress to adopt the
new $1.9 trillion fiscal stimulus package. In addition to the positive
corporative reporting, this fact allowed the US stock index to hit a new
all-time high. According to FactSet, as of January 20, actual earnings
data were better than expected by 88% of companies reporting. Besides,
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s believe in the rebound of the US economy in the second
quarter, so the US stock market's bullish sentiment is natural.

History knows only a few examples of the [S&P 500][2] fall during
economic booms. In 1946, after a short downturn, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s feared that
the economy would repeat the recession of the 1930s and sold stocks. In
1980, during a short-term recovery in the double-dip recession, the
stock index fell as the Fed tried to mitigate excessive inflation
growth. A drop in the [S&P 500][2] during a time of GDP growth is rare.
So, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s naturally stick to a strategy of buying the stocks on the
corrections and selling the dollar on the price rise. The EURUSD current
correction seems to be just the rebalancing of the large [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s’
positions.

The ECB passive attitude will support the recovery of the euro uptrend.
Investors don’t expect anything new from the central bank, so they
should focus on Christine Lagarde’s press conference. Not long ago, the
ECB president supported the central bank’s forecast for a 3.9% growth of
the euro-area GDP in 2021 following a decline by 7.3%. She said that it
is too early to discuss the ECB monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) tightening, and the ECB
is monitoring the euro’s exchange rate. She is likely to repeat the same
on January 21. The Central Bank has nothing to surprise [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s, and
the fact that the [EURUSD][1] correction reduces the need for verbal
intervention, on the contrary, may strengthen the euro.

### [EURUSD][1] trading plan for today

I do not think the ECB will expand the QE. The euro-area economy adjusts
to the pandemic and improves its performance. The US dollar bears go
ahead, and the [EURUSD][1] bulls could be only discouraged by slow
vaccination. The EU, where 1.4% of the population have been inoculated,
is behind the UK (7.1%) and USA (5%). However, the progress in the
vaccination campaign supports the euro. If the euro breaks out the
resistance at $1.215, it can be the reason to buy.
