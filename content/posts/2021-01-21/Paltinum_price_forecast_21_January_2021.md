Platinum says goodbye to depression. Forecast as of 21.01.2021Dmitri
Demidenko

The replacement of expensive raw materials with cheaper ones, the growth
of investment demand, and the rapid recovery of the eurozone GDP in the
second quarter create favorable conditions for continuing the
[XPTUSD][1] rally. Let’s discuss this topic and make up a trading plan.

## Fundamental platinum forecast for a quarter and a year

Any depression ends sooner or later. Over the past ten years, platinum
has been depressed and often lost to other assets in the precious metals
sector due to problems in the automotive industry. Only the pandemic and
recession brought the [XPTUSD][1] bulls to their senses, and in 2021
they are ready to prove that they are worth their salt. The rapid growth
of the global economy led by the industrial sector, acceleration of
inflation, increasing of global demand and [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/) stocks allow us to be
optimistic about the future of platinum.

Since the summer of 2018, the analyzed asset has been losing out to
palladium after manufacturers of diesel cars, which mainly use platinum,
were caught manipulating to pass emissions tests. The reorientation of
consumers to vehicles with gasoline engines sharply inflated the
[XPDUSD][2] prices and drove the [XPTUSD][1] bulls into depression. The
gap in prices began to widen rapidly and by February 2020 exceeded the
$1,500 mark, which made manufacturing companies think about replacing
the more expensive metal with a cheaper one. As a result, BASF SE, a
German multinational chemical company, developed a new technology to
partially replace palladium with platinum in gasoline engines, which, in
my opinion, will help narrow the spread.

About 43% of the analyzed asset demand is associated with the production
of autocatalysts, while the share of investment demand rarely reaches
15%. I believe that against the backdrop of accelerating inflation, this
indicator has the potential to grow, which may become another driver of
the [XPTUSD][1] rally in 2021. The “blue wave” in the USA led to a sharp
increase in Treasury bonds yield. However, rates on treasury inflation-
protected securities (TIPS) continue to be near record lows. This state
of the US debt market suggests that [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are confident in the Fed's
intention to adhere to ultra-easy monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) for a very long time.
This creates favorable conditions for the entire precious metals market
and investment demand. At the same time, interest in platinum from
European [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s is consistently high. Even [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/) capital outflows
during the recession were slower than in other regions of the planet.

Strong demand from Europe explains the strong correlation between
[XPTUSD][1] and the euro exchange rate. In case of acceleration of the
vaccination process in Europe, liftings of lockdowns, and the associated
rapid growth of the eurozone GDP in the second quarter, the [EURUSD][3]
pair will continue to rally. It should work for platinum's benefit.

### Platinum trading plan for a quarter and a year

Thus, the replacement of palladium for platinum in the autocatalysts'
production, the acceleration of inflation favorable for all precious
metals, an increase in [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/) reserves, as well as the prospects for
[EURUSD][3] growth, make it possible to expect the [XPTUSD][1] rally to
continue. In [December][4], I indicated 1150 and 1330 as medium and long
term targets. It's time to improve the outlook for platinum to
$1200-1235 per ounce during the first quarter and to $1330 before the
end of the year. I would suggest buying the platinum.
