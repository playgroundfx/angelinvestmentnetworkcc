Short-term forecast for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 21.01.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

Yesterday the gold price broke the accumulation [1859 - 1816] zone
upside. Therefore, today plan and enter precious metal's purchases with
the target at the Target Zone 2 [2005.8 - 1994.3]

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

Yesterday, oil prices were growing and approaching the medium-term
resistance of the Target Zone 4 [54.72 - 54.21]. The trend is still up,
and there are no patterns to work in the correction.

The technical support level is shifting to level 51.88. In case of a
support breakout, it will be possible to sell oil.

Let's take a look at the chart of a shorter timeframe. Yesterday bulls'
activity could be observed at the trading session opening. In the middle
of the trading day, a reversal occurred, and bears came to the
forefront. The day candle closed with a long tail at the top and a small
body.

Today do not rush to buy oil. The price may return below the resistance
zone [53.04 - 52.67]. In this case, a “false breakout” and a sell signal
will occur. Therefore, sell oil down to the Intermediary Zone [51.66 -
51.43].

As for buying, the bulls need to form a corresponding pattern on the
chart, that is still missing.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

  1. Sell according to the pattern in the zone of [53.04 - 52.67]. TakeProfit: Intermediary Zone [51.66 - 51.43]. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. Buy according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone [51.66 - 51.43]. TakeProfit: 53.88. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

Yesterday the gold price broke the accumulation [1859 - 1816] zone
upside. Therefore, today plan and enter precious metal's purchases with
the target at the Target Zone 2 [2005.8 - 1994.3].

The gold short-term trend has reversed up. Yesterday the bulls broke out
the Intermediary Zone [1857 - 1852] and closed the US session above the
zone. For the next few days, the upper Target Zone [1912 - 1902] will be
the target for purchases.

According to the methodology, the price range [1857 - 1847] is a
promising support area. If the price corrects to this range, look for a
buy pattern.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

Hold up purchases entered in the zone of [1859.2 - 1816.9]. TakeProfit:
Target Zone 2 [2005.8 - 1994.3]. StopLoss: 1830.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

According to the margin zones' methodology, the euro is currently
trading in the correction to the medium-term downtrend. The target for
sales is the current week's low and Target Zone 2 [1.1981 - 1.1962]. The
key resistance is located at the levels [1.2229 - 1.2213].

Yesterday, as part of the correction to the short-term downtrend, the
bulls tested the Intermediary Zone [1.2141 - 1.2133]. It was not
possible to break out the zone. A sell pattern was formed - a sign of a
bearish engulfing on the hourly timeframe.

As a result of the price drop at the US trading session, the price
passed the average [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) move and stopped at 1.2081 level. After that,
the bulls showed activity again.

Today began with the euro price rise. Now the price is testing
resistance again. Wait and see if the zone will be broken out or not,
and you can observe the sell pattern again.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

Sell according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone [1.2141 - 1.2133].
TakeProfit: 1.2055. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.
