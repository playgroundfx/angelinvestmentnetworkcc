GBPUSD and EURGBP. Trading plan and actual scenario for 2020 as of
08.10.2020Mikhail Hypov

Here’s my promised forecast for the British pound. GBPUSD is approaching
its historic lows, and the question is: should we buy the pound while
it’s at the bottom? Or should we wait for another one? Let’s find it
out.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Fundamental analysis

I’m not going to go deep into “the fundamentals” as [this article of
mine][1] contains some deep fundamental analysis already. Almost nothing
has changed since that.  The UK economy is frozen at the previous
levels. There was no recovery after the first wave, and the country is
now getting ready for the second coronavirus wave.

However, the key factor that affects the pound rate is London and
Brussels’ trade agreement talks. At the beginning of 2021, Great Britain
will leave the European Union. All economic activities between the EU
and the UK will be conducted on general [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) unless a trade agreement
has been signed before that moment. BAKER & MCKENZIE estimates that
London will lose around 134 billion GBP each year in a no-deal scenario.

UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson urges the EU to take the final decision
and sets a tough deadline for deal talks: at least the first draft of
the deal must be accepted before October 15.

At the same time, Europe doesn’t yield to Johnson’s pressure.

After the meeting with Johnson, President of the European Council
Charles Michel made a post on twitter, saying that “the EU prefers a
deal, but not at any cost”. The press service confirmed that the
European Union is ready for whatever is coming. They admit that the UK
and the EU haven’t reached a deal on many issues, including fishing in
border waters.  Goldman Sachs is optimistic and says a no-deal Brexit is
hardly possible. It admits that the pound sterling’s current position is
favourable to buyers. To check the reasons for such optimism, let’s do
technical analysis.

## Technical analysis of GBPUSD

As seen in the chart above,  GBPUSD is in a bearish trend. The pair is
consolidating near historic lows.

We see in the enlarged monthly chart that the pair is in a flat market,
moving in the range of 1.195 - 1.3515 crossed by a bearish trend line.
Thus the market will have been pushed outside the balance zone by the
beginning of 2023.

In the weekly chart, there’s much uncertainty around GBPUSD.  The quote
is in the balance zone here too. The rate is near the neutral P level of
the annual Pivot point. A local bullish trend supports the pair from
below. MACD and Stochastic don’t show any divergences with the price and
are in balance. According to tick volumes, a strong seller is in the
market at the moment. So, GBPUSD’s rate is still under pressure.  Thus,
a breakout of the local trend is a question of time. Afterwards, the
lower part of the range will be easily accessible.

The pair looks more optimistic in the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) chart above. The bullish
divergence between the MACD and the price is working out at the moment.
There were good buy volumes at the retracement from 1.269. A big buyer
outlined his/her interest zone and won’t easily give it up in the
future. Weekly triple EMA (red line) and October’s Pivot balance point
stop the bulls from above. Thus, the local bullish trend may continue,
but in fact it’s limited by the level of 1.30.

## Trading plan for GBPUSD

The local bullish trend is likely to be broken out before the end of
2020, so short positions opened from a psychologically important level
of 1.30 are the most actual scenario. Stop orders shouldn’t be placed to
far in this scenario. The perfect zone would be above 1.30 and above the
annual Pivot point.  Target upon breakout: 1.23. That level coincides
with the highest market activity area and the annual Pivot S1.

The H4 time frame confirms the reversal. MACD cascades in the form of
classic bearish divergences. However, Stochastic is directed upwards,
and the long shadows of yesterday’s candlesticks suggest that the bulls
are still able to move upwards. The projection of triple weekly EMA and
the weekly Pivot R1 level lie in the area of 1.297. That is a good level
for going short and building up shorts down to the level of 1.30.

## Technical analysis of EURGBP

Based on EURGBP’s multi-year chart, the pair is in a global bullish
trend and has been moving in an ascending channel.

Active sales are taking place near the upper limits of that channel.
They form long upward shadows. The EURGBP rate is currently located near
that sales area. I can’t answer the question whether or not a long
upward shadow will form again for now.

On the weekly time frame, EURGBP is consolidating in an equilateral
triangle. There’s no clear trend. According to MACD, there is a bearish
divergence, but it will be confirmed only after a drop below the local
bullish trend. The rate is likely to continue its movement at  0.90 -
0.92 up to the end of this year.

As shown on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) TF above, EURGBP is in the balance zone: the rate
is within Double BBs on [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) and weekly time frames marked in orange
and blue, respectively. MACD is directed downwards, but there are no
active sales for now. The EURGBP bears have a slight advantage over the
bulls, but Stochastic is directed upwards, and the sellers’ zone may be
retested.

## Trading plan for EURGBP

As EURGBP won’t be trending in the medium term, we’ll have a 2-week
trading plan. Short positions may be opened at  0.911 - 0.913 with a
stop order above 0.916 and a target at the local low of 0.905. The P/R
ratio of 2.11 is quite acceptable under this plan. If the pair’s fall is
accompanied with good volumes, short positions may be kept down to the
triangle’s lower edge at 0.90 GBP for 1 euro.

## Conclusion

Globally, the pound sterling is in a less advantageous position than the
euro or the USD, but in the short term the market is in a flat trading
channel. The pound may start a bullish correction and strengthen its
positions. I will be following the situation to open a short position on
the most advantageous conditions. Fundamentally, the pound owes its
weakness to the coronavirus and Brexit. However, don’t turn your back on
the GBP.  In contrast to Europe, where the risk of deflation is real and
the refinance rate is at minus 0.5, the Bank of England managed to keep
the rate in the positive zone at 0.1. According to fundamental
multipliers, that is a good advantage that won’t allow the pound to
rewrite its historic lows.

That’s all for now! What do you think? Do you agree with my forecast?
