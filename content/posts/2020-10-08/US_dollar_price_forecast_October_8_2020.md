Dollar corrects the error. Forecast 08.10.2020Dmitri Demidenko

Cutting off talks with Democrats to expand fiscal stimulus could be a
serious political mistake resulting in Trump’s loss and the dollar’s
drop. Let us discuss this issue and make up a [EURUSD][1] trading plan

##  ** **Weekly US dollar fundamental forecast****

While Donald Trump is making every effort to raise his approval rating,
sometimes making inadequate decisions, the Fed and the ECB continue
currency wars. Christine Lagarde says an early termination of monetary
support may result in a deep recession of the euro-area economy so that
monetary stimulus will continue for a long time. Federal Reserve Bank of
Chicago President Charles Evans says the Fed can take more action. The
US central bank can boost bond purchases or focus the QE on longer-
maturity bonds. Talks about monetary easing are a bearish factor for a
currency. So, the speeches of the central banks’ officials sound like
currency interventions. Investors, however, worry about different
issues.

Focused on the fight between the candidates within the presidential
campaign, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s pay little attention to the FOMC September meeting
minutes. The Fed explains it will not raise the federal funds rate until
the following conditions are met. The labor market must meet the goals
of full employment; inflation should be at least 2%. Finally, the
forecast or the market indicators should suggest that the PCE will
moderately exceed 2% over a period of time. The Federal Reserve in
September increases the gauges of the key economic indicators, but it
was made with the consideration of an additional fiscal stimulus, which
hasn’t yet been provided.

Donald Trump tried to mitigate the negative from his announcement to end
negotiations with Democrats by calling for Congress to allocate $ 25
billion to the aviation industry to fight mass layoffs. House Speaker
Nancy Pelosi called this an attempt to correct a political mistake made
the day before and recalled that Republicans refused to accept a similar
proposal from the Democrats a couple of weeks ago. Political disputes
fuel market turmoil. However, the talks about partial stimulus send the
[S&P 500][2] up.

The current situation is similar to what happened in spring when the
risk appetite determined Forex trends, and the [EURUSD][1] was rather
responsive to the US stock indexes.

Investors consider what is better, Joe Biden's corporate tax hike and a
bigger fiscal stimulus or Donald Trump's income tax cut and a less
bailout. This first option is more beneficial in the middle-term. The
stimulus will soon exhaust while tightening the fiscal policies is a
long-term factor.

### Weekly [EURUSD][1] trading plan

Trump’s tweets shocked financial markets; however, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s expect the
Democrats to win the November elections. This fact, in addition to the
confidence that the Fed will maintain the ultra-easy monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/),
must stop the [S&P 500][2] sell-offs. If so, the [EURUSD][1] correction
will hardly be deep. Nonetheless, the storm hasn’t ended yet. There
could just be a wider trading range of 1.166-1.188.
