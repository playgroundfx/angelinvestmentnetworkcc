Yuan is the Forex leader. Forecast 08.10.2020Dmitri Demidenko

Yuan buyers can be discouraged by only Donald Trump. If Trump wins the
election on November 3, he will likely resume the US-China trade war. In
the meanwhile, the renminbi doesn’t have flaws. Let us discuss the yuan
prospects and make up a [USDCNH][1] trading plan.

## Monthly yuan fundamental forecast

The more eccentric is Donald Trump's behavior, the stronger are the
[USDCNH][1] bears. The US protectionism created a lot of problems for
the yuan in 2018-2019. However, the trade deal between Washington and
Beijing has solved some of the troubles. Beijing has efficiently managed
the pandemic, China’s economy is expanding and the assets attract
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s. That is why the renminbi and the associated currencies have
become Forex leaders. The 13% rally of the Aussie and the 11% rally of
the Kiwi over the past six months are natural, as China accounts for 40%
and 27% in the Australian and New Zealand exports accordingly.

The FX rates are determined by capital flows, and the money goes to a
more favorable place. The US economy is in recession, the
epidemiological situation is difficult, and the political risks are
rising ahead of the US presidential election. So, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s look for
alternatives to US assets. So, the capital flow in Asia. Because of the
rapid localization of COVID-19, the People's Bank Of China did not need
to drastically ease monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), as the Fed did. Beijing was more
focused on fiscal stimulus, and this strategy widened the yield gap
between 10-year China and US bonds to 190 bp. Over the past twelve
months, including August, the net capital flows into China’s bond market
to ¥ 615 billion ($ 90 billion), to the equity market - ¥ 93 billion.
The overseas [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s’ holdings of China's bonds increased to ¥2.8
trillion, the equity holdings were up to ¥1 trillion.

### Dynamics of foreign holdings of Chinese assets

The POBC encourages [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s to buy local securities promising to
continue to simplify the process of acquiring Chinese assets by foreign
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s. The Chinese central bank also expects other central banks to
use the yuan as the reserve asset. Beijing must have abandoned its
former tactics when it stimulated exports by weakening the local
currency. It seems reasonable under the current conditions. It doesn’t
make sense to bet on the foreign demand amid the pandemic rampaging in
most countries. It is better to encourage domestic consumers also
supporting the renminbi growth and increasing imports. Yes, the foreign
trade surplus will be shrinking, but China has the resources to
compensate for this factor, it is the foreign demand for Chinese assets.

If Donald Trump wins the election, the [USDCNH][1] will be corrected
down amid the risk of the US-China trade war escalation. As long as Joe
Biden’s ratings grow, the yuan will continue strengthening.

### Monthly [USDCNH][1] trading plan

I believe the renminbi is an obvious leader in Forex. It is supported by
the divergence in economic expansion and monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). The political
environment in China is more favorable than in the US. Furthermore,
capitals flow into China’s markets. The [USDCNH][1] has been 6.8% down
from May’s high, it is likely to continue falling down. I recommend
selling the pair with the pairs with targets at 6.65 and 6.5.
