[Stochastic Oscillator](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/stochastic-oscillator.html): Guide for Using Indicator in Forex TradingMikhail
Hypov

In this article, you will find the most comprehensive overview of the
stochastic oscillator. We will cover its structure, signals, and
compatibility with other instruments. Moreover, we will test stochastic
[trading strategies](https://www.fintechee.com/forex-trading-strategies/) in practice.

The article covers the following subjects:

## What Is a [Stochastic Oscillator](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/stochastic-oscillator.html)?

The stochastic oscillator is a technical analysis indicator that
reflects the dynamic changes between the bar's closing price and price
extremes for a given period.

The instrument's primary function is to determine market patterns, such
as:

  * local extremes;
  * the beginning and end of a trend;
  * convergence and divergence; and
  * the beginning of a correction.

The premise is that the closing price stays at the previous local
maximums for a while in the bullish trend and stops at the level of
prior minimums in a bearish trend.

Stochastic oscillators are effective when used on a 1-minute timeframe
as well as on hourly, [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/), or weekly timeframes.

### History of the Stochastic Indicator

The **stochastic oscillator indicator** was invented in 1950 by American
stock analyst George Lane.

Once, while observing the price changes, he noticed that there was not a
trend but a reciprocating movement that prevailed on the market. So, he
developed an indicator that would catch these dynamics and signal
reversals in both directions. The stochastic indicator was based on the
price bar's major parameters – closing, high, and low prices.

According to one of the theories, there were initially many types of
stochastic oscillators. Combinations of price bar parameters and their
derivatives were sorted out to determine the best stochastic oscillator
formula. Each formula was named by sequential letters of the Latin
alphabet: %A, %B, %C, etc. However, only two [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/), %К and %R, were
successful.

A combination of the stochastic %К and its moving average, named D (from
the word deviation), became the best option.

Technically, D isn't stochastic - it is a derivative from %K. However,
it is called stochastic and even has a % symbol. This is how the well-
known stochastic oscillator was created.

At the same time, the stochastic %R did not disappear. It can be found
under the name "%R Larry Williams Oscillator" or simply "R Williams."

## How Does the [Stochastic Oscillator](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/stochastic-oscillator.html) Work?

Classically, stochastic oscillators are represented by two moving curves
that move between two levels. Usually, these are 80% and 20%.

The solid orange line in the image above is called %K, and the blue line
is the 3-period moving average of the %K curve.

When two lines are above the upper level of 80% (marked with blue zones
at the top), the instrument is overbought. When they fall below the
bottom horizontal line of 20% (red zones in the bottom), it's oversold.

Line crosses have a special meaning. If it happens in the overbought
zone, it’s a signal of a short position. If it is in the oversold area,
you should open a long trade.

Nevertheless, it's not recommended to trade using only stochastic
oscillators. In the simplest stochastic oscillator strategy, signals are
filtered by the trend direction. For instance, if a downtrend prevails,
open only short positions. If there is an upward trend, place long
trades.

On the [EURUSD][1] chart, there is a bearish trend. That's why we look
for a point to open a short trade in overbought zones. A potential entry
point is marked with a red oval. As there is a crossover of the
indicator lines above 80%, a short-term correction should end, and the
downtrend will continue.

### Stochastic [Momentum](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/momentum.html) Index (SMI) Explained

In addition to the classic stochastic indicator, a modified version
called the Stochastic [Momentum](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/momentum.html) Index indicator, or SMI, is widely used.
It combines the aforementioned tool with momentum, which provides
smoother signals and is less dependent on market noise.

In SMI, curves are built around a zero line and move in either a
positive or negative direction. One of the curves is called smoothed or
fast; another one is short-term. As you can guess, these lines differ by
period.

Some of the stochastic momentum indicator’s pros are its reliable entry
and exit signals when the market is flat. Still, even in such a case,
it's worth using the SMI with other technical tools. As for the
directional movement, the SMI provides plenty of fake signals.

You can download the Stochastic [Momentum](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/momentum.html) Index [here][2].

The standard installation process is via MetaTrader4. For beginner
traders, check the step-by-step explanation using the example of the
[Bollinger Bands](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/bollinger-bands.html) indicator [here][3].

Install and run the indicator. In the "Input parameters" tab, you can
change parameters such as:

  * «Period_Q» – a period of the algorithm’s primary curve
  * «Period_R» –  primary smoothing of the main line
  * «Period_S» – secondary smoothing of the main line
  * «Signal» – the parameter responsible for the smoothing of the secondary signal curve

If both the main and signal curves (the green and red lines on the chart
above) are above the zero line (blue), the market is overbought; if
below, the market is oversold.

A sell signal is formed when the main momentum line crosses the signal
line upside-down.

On the chart above, the red arrow marks this moment. If the stochastic
indicator breaks the signal line bottom-up (green arrow), open a long
position. A stop-loss can be placed slightly below local minimums within
several candles from the entry point. Close the position at either a
take profit level, which is 2-3 times bigger than stop-loss, or when a
reversal signal occurs.

## Stochastic Indicator Calculation & Formula

Let's consider the stochastic oscillator’s formula.

%K is calculated as follows:

Where:

  *  _max (Hn)_ – a top within an n period;
  *  _min (Ln)_ – a low within an n period; and
  *  _С0_ – a close price of the current candlestick.

Here’s an example of the stochastic’s formula that uses three periods.

On the chart, the bar with which we calculate the stochastic indicator
is marked with green. The close price is 1,17994. The green line
highlights the highest price for the last three candles - 1,17994. The
red line marks the minimum of the previous three candles, which is
1,17948.

According to the formula above:

%K = 100 х ((1,17972 – 1,17948)/1,17994 – 1,17948) = 100 х
(0,00024/0,00046) = 52,17%

This is how traders used to calculate stochastic readings. Nowadays, it
seems extremely inconvenient.

Alternatively, you can use an [automated](https://www.fintechee.com/features/automated-forex-trading/) indicator integrated into the
LiteForex [online platform][4], Metatrader 4, or download the stochastic
oscillator as an Excel calculator here. The principle of how this
calculator works is straightforward. It is like the Excel Bollinger
Bands Table (the link to the instructions is [here][5]).

## Stochastic Indicator Interpretation: Reading the Charts

When using the stochastic indicator on Forex, there are many signals.
That's why this tool is often used with other indicators for more
accurate signals. In the following sections, we will explain the
specifics of the signal types, methods of interpretation, and detection.

### Fast, Slow & Full Indicators

How do you set the stochastic indicator? Usually, the parameters are
defined by three meanings. One for each % K, % D, and smoothing
coefficient. 5, 3, 3 is one of the classic combinations.

Where:

  *  5 is a period of %K- the leading stochastic curve. As you might remember, we have already broken down [how to](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-trading-how-to/) calculate this parameter. The stochastic formula looks like this:

The value 5 means that maximums and minimums will be calculated for the
last five candles. In the formula, this parameter is presented by n.

  * 3 – задает период кривой %D, так называемой сигнальной линии. Она представляет собой обычную скользящую среднюю, которая строится на конечных данных %K.

  * 3 reflects the period of %D, a so-called signal line. It's a simple moving average built on the final parameters of %K.

3 is the last parameter of the slow stochastic oscillator. It's used to
smooth the %K curve, making it more flowing without market noise. In
other words, initial %K is calculated with an averaging coefficient.

In such a case, the formula for %K is as follows:

The %D curve will be built on the average value of %K. In fact, it will
be double smoothed. Such an effect allows you to filter noise and reduce
the number of fake signals, but it also increases the indicator's lag.
That's why it's called slow.

If you don't want to use smoothing, you should use 1 as the last
parameter. Such stochastic indicators are called fast.

The full version of the stochastic oscillator allows you to change all
three parameters and even how %D stochastic is smoothed.

LiteForex provides the full version of the indicator. But if I could, I
would call it [Super Full][1]! Platform provides such comprehensive
settings.

LiteForex supports four types of smoothing:

  * Simple is classic smoothing and uses a simple moving average (SMA)
  * Exponential smooths using an exponential moving average (EMA)
  * Linear Weighted smooths using Linear Weighted Moving Average (LWMA)
  * Smoothed is double smoothing due to the feature of the Smoothed MA (Smoothed MA).

Such [functions](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/basic-functions/) allow the user to set stochastic oscillators for any
trading tool and market. There are no strict rules on what smooth
settings to use, but it's vital to consider their differences for
successful trading experiments.

Let’s visually compare how they differ.

There is a price chart above where numbers correspond to five signals of
the stochastic oscillator on Forex.

It's clear that the second and fourth signals are fake. The first and
fifth ones reflect the local correction. The most valuable signal is the
third one, which indicates a trend reversal.

Note! Here, the signals are a cross of %K and %D lines above 80% and
below 20%. Later, we will talk about indicator signals in detail. Now,
it should be remembered as a condition for the experiment.

On the chart above, we see the following stochastic oscillators:

  1. Fast
  2. Slow with an SMA
  3. Slow with an EMA
  4. Slow with an LWMA
  5. Slow with a Smoothed MA

Periods for all stochastics are similar: %K - 5, %D - 3. A smoothing
period for all types except fast stochastic is 3.

Conclusions:

  1.  **A fast stochastic oscillator** reacts to the market movements faster than other types. It operates almost without a delay, but the number of fake signals is large.
  2. Slow stochastic oscillators with SMA and LWMA are almost identical regarding the lag and number of fake signals.
  3. The filter of the **slow stochastic indicator** with Smoothed MA was too strong and suppressed almost all signals. It provided only the last alert out of five.
  4. The most effective slow stochastic was the one with smoothing EMA. This indicator successfully filtered fake signals and was slightly faster compared to its counterparts.

We tested the signals on the M30 chart of the [EURUSD][1] pair. Still,
results may vary on other timeframes and trading instruments. You can
compare stochastic oscillators right now on [LiteForex][6] in several
clicks without registering.

Timeframes also play an important role. The **best stochastic oscillator
settings** for М5, М15, М30, and, sometimes, H1 timeframes are (10,7,3),
(7, 3, 3), or (5, 3, 3). On high timeframes, such parameters will
contribute to plenty of false signals. Therefore, **stochastic
oscillator settings** for H4, D1, and, sometimes, H1 charts are (9, 3,
3), (14, 3, 3) or (21, 3, 3).

You can use slower curves with (21, 7, 7) or (21, 14, 14) settings for
[daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) and weekly charts. The described setting combinations are used
most often. You can practice and pick up your own parameters. Maybe you
will succeed and find a perfect combination for your **stochastic
strategy**.

### Crossovers

The crossover between the %К and %D curves is the leading signal of the
stochastic oscillator tool. It's analyzed only in overbought and
oversold zones. In other cases, such signs are useless.

There are two types of crossovers:

  * When the %K curve breaks above the %D line, the trend is bullish. In this case, it's worth placing a pending order slightly above the cross point.
  * When the %K curve crosses the %D line upside-down, a bearish trend begins. A short position should be open slightly below the breakout point.

Below I will show [how to](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-trading-how-to/) use the stochastic oscillator on the
[EURUSD][1] chart.

Above the green oval, you can see an upward cross of %K and %D lines.
Since the signal occurred below 20%, the risk of it being false is low.
Here, it's worth opening a long trade near the highest point of the
crossover candlestick. On the chart above, I marked the entry level with
a green line.

Here, we observe the opposite situation. A %K curve crosses the %D line
downwards at the level, slightly above 80%. Therefore, we open a short
position near the close price of the candlestick where the cross
happened.

At the same time, a small shift down is acceptable. In the chart above,
this situation is marked with a red oval.

### Overbought & Oversold

The overbought issue occurs within an uptrend when the main line crosses
the 80% level in an upward direction. It's a sign that the rise slows
down, and the price reverses down. Generally, a sell position should be
open when the line breaks the 80% level back from the top in the
downward direction.

Oversold conditions happen in the downtrend when the line falls below
the 20% level. In a similar fashion, it signals a slowdown of the price
decline and that there is about to be a reversal. It's recommended to
buy when the curve exits the oversold area crossing the 20% line bottom-
up.

When analyzing the indicator's behavior in overbought or oversold zones,
it's worth considering the reversal's formation. If the primary curve
forms an acute angle, the following price movement will be intense. If
the repeated break occurs after flat conditions, the move will likely be
weaker but stable.

On the chart, blue squares indicate overbought areas; red ones mark
oversold zones. In all three cases, the price reverses. The right blue
square displays a sharp turn. It corresponds with the area on the graph
marked with a blue oval. After the reversal, there is an intensive
downward movement.

### Bull & Bear Divergences

Divergence occurs rarely, but its signals are highly accurate.

For instance,

  * When a price hits maximums, but %K and %D curves can't overcome previous tops (marked with the blue line), it means there will likely be a reversal in the downward direction soon. We can open a short position after the indicator's moving averages cross and the signal candlestick closes.
  * When a price falls, but %К and %D curves don't reach previous lows (marked with red lines), it's a sign of the upward reversal. We can open a buy trade after the cross and closure of the signal candlestick.

Entry signals are marked with black circles.

Based on the text above, you can understand what the divergence is and
recognize its bullish and bearish formations. If you aren't sure yet,
you should read the article ["What the divergence on Forex is,"][7]
where the issue is explained in detail.

Ignore the fact that there is a different indicator in the article. The
stochastic oscillator follows the classic rules of the technical
analysis for divergence and convergence. Everything you read in this
article will work for the stochastic.

### Bull & Bear Set-ups

Bullish and bearish patterns look the same as divergences we covered
above, but they provide different signals:

A bullish pattern is adjusted when the price forms a lower-than-previous
high, but the stochastic has a higher high. It leads to a short-term
price decline and a reversal. So, this pattern should be used as a
bullish entry point ahead of the upcoming rise.

A bearish pattern occurs when the price has higher lows, but the
oscillator forms a lower minimum. Later, the price will rebound and
reverse.

Circles and violet lines mark local minimums on the price chart and the
stochastic indicator. This means the formation of a bullish pattern that
outruns the reversal signal. There is a short-term price decline (red
area), a price reversal, and a new bullish trend (green area).

## Real Examples of Using Stochastic Indicator in Forex Trading

The stochastic indicator provides a vast number of different signals. It
can be applied to different trading methods: scalping, intraday, swing
trading, etc. Below, we’ll provide more information about using the
oscillator in different timeframes.

### Intraday Trading

First, let’s look at [how to](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-trading-how-to/) add and set the stochastic oscillator for
intraday timeframes.

To implement the indicator in the chart, press "Indicators" and choose
"[Stochastic Oscillator](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/stochastic-oscillator.html)" from the dropdown list.

Most importantly, let's define the leading trend of the price movement.
We will do it using the stochastic with 21, 7, and 7 parameters.

It's essential to determine the indicator's direction and its location
in the area above or below 50%. In our case, the blue main %K line is in
the chart's upper zone and is moving down (the green oval). Therefore,
the downward movement is dominant.

The intraday trading occurs on timeframes that are not bigger than H1.
For example, we will take the M30 one. The perfect settings for such a
timeframe are 5, 3, and 3.

As the primary movement is downward, during the day, we will look for
periods when lines enter the overbought zone and %K crosses %D from the
bottom up. One such case is marked with a green oval. Note, curves stay
in the overbought area for a long time. That's why the upcoming downward
movement is supposed to be stable.

The next step is to identify the reversal pattern. An example of such a
setup is depicted above as Doji. Still, there can be any other reversal
combination of a classic candlestick analysis and [Price Action][8].

Usually, it appears near the cross of the %K and %D curves. On the
chart, this pattern is marked with a blue oval. When one of the
following candles crosses a low point of the pattern, open a sell
position at the price of 1.18329 (blue line on the chart). The stop-loss
is placed slightly above the maximum point of the reversal pattern (red
line), and the take profit should equal two stop-losses.

There is an alternative option to define the take profit level. When the
price falls, relocate the stop-loss to a breakeven zone. Touching or
crossing the 20% level will be a signal to close a position. In our
case, such a situation is marked with a red oval.

You can fix your profit when the candlestick closes on the breakdown of
the 20% line (green line) on the price of 1.17971.

As a result, we get the profit of 0.00358 points (1.18329 – 1.17971 =
0.00358).

### Scalping

For the scalping strategy, we will use a 5-minute timeframe and the
stochastic settings:

  * Period %K – 10;
  * Period %D – 7; and
  * Length – 3.

Big periods for such a timeframe will be compensated by changing the
limits to 30 and 70. You can change these parameters in the "Style" tab
of the indicator's settings.

We will buy if the following conditions are met:

  * Lines are on the border of 30% or beyond; and
  * %K crosses %D from the bottom.

Conditions for a sell trade:

  * Lines are on the border of 70% or beyond
  * %K crosses %D from the top.

Stop loss is set at the extreme of the local minimum of 3-5 previous
candles. The take profit is placed at a distance of the stop-loss or
more in 5-10 points. It is recommended to trade with small fixed lots.

The blue circle points at the cross of the %K and %D lines upside-down
above the 70% level. We open a sell position at the close of the
candlestick (the blue line). The stop loss is placed at the local
maximum (the red line), and the take profit is almost at the same
distance (the green line).

As we can see from the chart, the trade was successfully closed at the
take profit level. To open a buy trade, the steps are similar.

On the chart above, there is an example of the scalping strategy for a
long trade. As we can see, the price hasn't reached the take profit
level but turned around. You should be ready for such situations as
sometimes stochastic indicators provide fake signals. Profit is gained
due to narrow stop-losses and plenty of trades, but most of them should
be profitable.

### Swing Trading

To understand the stochastic swing strategy, we should learn the "Star"
pattern. There are two types.

The "Morning Star" consists of three consecutive bars:

  * The first one is bearish with a long body;
  * The second one forms with a gap (ideally) with a bottom shadow and a short body; and
  * The third one is bullish with a long green body that overcomes the most significant part of the first candle's body.

The opposite is the "Evening Star." It includes three bars:

  * The first one is bullish with a long green body;
  * The second one has a short body and a gap up (ideally); and
  * The third one is with a bearish long red body covering the most significant part of the first candlestick.

To be completely honest, the ideal version of the pattern occurs rarely.
But it's vital for the one in the middle to have a long shadow in the
direction of the completing trend, and for the next candle to have a
long body.

At the same time, the longer the body, the more reliable the signal is.
In an ideal scenario, it should cover several previous candles. In the
picture above, you can see an example of the shooting star that doesn't
correspond to all the rules but provides a strong sell signal.

We will use the best stochastic settings for swing trading. These are 5,
3, and 3, which provide sufficient signal density.

Conditions for a long position:

  * Stochastic is below the 20 level;
  * There is a morning star pattern at the reversal; and
  * The market starts moving upward.

Conditions for a short position:

  * Stochastic is above the 80 level;
  * There is a shooting star pattern at a reversal; and
  * The market starts moving down.

We should open a trade as soon as the bar after the pattern crosses its
extreme in the trend direction. The stop-loss is set at the maximum
point of the "Star". We will close the position as soon as there is a
cross of stochastic lines either above 80% or below 20%.

On the chart, you can see the shooting star's formation with the
simultaneous crossing of the indicator lines in the overbought zone (the
blue circle).

To make it more transparent, look at the zoomed-in picture of the
pattern above.

We opened a trade at 1.37637, when the bar crossed the pattern's minimum
point (the blue line). A signal to exit the market was a curve cross
marked with the red circle. We fixed the profit at 1.34695- the close of
the candlestick. The final profit was 2942 points (1.37637 – 1.34695 =
.02942).

## Using a [Stochastic Oscillator](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/stochastic-oscillator.html) When Trading S&P 500 and U.S. Dollar

Each instrument shows its own behavior. It's crucial to consider it when
trading. Below, we’ll look at **stochastic trading** features on the S&P
500 futures, gold, and the U.S. dollar.

###  **S &P 500** Trading

Looking at this instrument's [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) price movements, it's visible
that the price decline doesn't always follow a stochastic move to the
overbought area. Vice versa, when the indicator is in the oversold zone,
it's more likely the market will rise soon.

The signals of a bullish reversal work well when the market is
temporarily oversold in the uptrend. Signs of a bullish correction will
likely work if the market entered an overbought area in the downtrend.

###  **Gold** Trading

When trading gold, it's not recommended to use overbought/oversold
signals even with a line crossing.

When the market is temporarily oversold in the uptrend, signals on a
bullish reversal usually don't work. Meanwhile, it's likely a bearish
reversal works when the market is temporarily overbought in a downtrend.

### U.S. Dollar Trading

The U.S. dollar often continues moving following the momentum when
curves enter overbought or oversold zones. Therefore, you should enter
the market when there is a price reversal. The **stochastic Forex
strategy** isn't useful for USD if it's based on fixing overbought
conditions during an uptrend and oversold ones during a downtrend.

## Combining a [Stochastic Oscillator](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/stochastic-oscillator.html) With Other Indicators

The stochastic oscillator is a high-frequency indicator that can give
many false signals, especially in strong directional movements. It makes
sense to use the oscillator with other trend indicators. Let's consider
the most popular combinations of stochastic oscillators with other
tools.

### Moving Averages

This is one of the simplest trend strategies that allow traders to get
good results. To define a long-term trend, we will use the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/)
timeframe, while entry and exit points will be determined on the hourly
one.

First, we add three exponential moving averages with periods of 50-,
100-, and 200-bars.

We use a stochastic oscillator to find the entry levels. The recommended
settings are:

  * Periods: 14, 3, and 3; and
  * Levels: 90% and 10%.

Conditions for a long trade:

  * There is a long-term upward trend on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) chart; the price moves up and is above the EMA (50), while the EMA (50) is above EMA (100), which, in turn, is above EMA (200).
  * On the hourly chart, the oscillator crosses 10%.

Conditions for a short trade:

  * There is a long-term downward trend on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) chart; the price moves down and is below the EMA (50), while the EMA (50) is below EMA (100). And EMA (100) is below EMA (200).
  * On the hourly chart, the oscillator crosses 90%.

Place the stop-loss slightly below the local extreme. Profit can be
fixed by a take profit that is two times bigger than the stop-loss or by
a trailing stop of EMA (50). If the price is below it, you should fix
profit.

In another version of the **stochastic strategy on Forex** , you should
wait for the stochastic to enter overbought or oversold areas to fix
profit. To make it clear, look at the example below.

We observe a long-term uptrend on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) chart. Therefore, we will
only open long trades.

With the hourly time frame, we wait until the curves cross 10% (the blue
circle).

We enter the market at the close of the breakout bar (the blue line). A
stop-loss is placed slightly below the minimum (the red line).

During the price movement, the stop-loss first moves to the breakeven
and then to the profitable zone. We close the trade when the stochastic
indicator comes closer to the 90% line (the green line).

### Trendlines

All trend strategies are used to open positions in the current trend or
fix profit when the trend changes. Still, an entry point is considered a
weak spot. A stochastic oscillator can solve this issue. A combination
of a stochastic oscillator with any trend indicator can provide good
results.

In this regard, it's essential to follow several rules:

  1. Determine a trend on high timeframes;
  2. Don't open trades against the trend; and
  3. Use a %K and %D cross in the overbought/oversold areas to define an entry point.

Try to use a stochastic oscillator with your favorite trend indicator.
Follow these three simple rules, and you will be surprised by the
result.

### [Bollinger Bands](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/bollinger-bands.html)

The [Bollinger Bands](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/bollinger-bands.html) indicator is the leading tool in this strategy,
while the stochastic oscillator will be used as a signal filter. You can
read more about them in my article ["[Bollinger Bands](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/bollinger-bands.html) Indicator in
Forex"][10].

Note! This strategy is intra-channel. The trade occurs within Bollinger
Bands. The indicator settings are standard: the moving average period is
20 candles, and the standard deviation multiplier is 2.

We should also add a stochastic oscillator with 5, 3, and 3 parameters.

Conditions for a buy trade:

  * A bar crosses (or at least touches) the bottom line of the [Bollinger Bands](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/bollinger-bands.html); and
  * The %K line crosses the %D line bottom-up below 20%.

We can enter the market at the opening of the next candle after the
signaling one.

Conditions for a sell trade:

  * A bar crosses or at least touches the upper boundary of the [Bollinger Bands](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/bollinger-bands.html); and
  * The %K line crosses the %D line upside-down above 80%.

Enter the market at an opening of the candle that follows the signal
one.

A stop-loss is set with a small shift from the extreme point of the
breakout bar. The ideal take profit level is at the opposite band of the
Bollinger indicator. When working with a buy trade, it should be placed
at the upper boundary, during a sell trade – at the bottom band.

Let's take a look at the strategy of Bollinger bands and stochastic
oscillators through an example.

The blue circle points to the moment when the bar touches the bottom
line. In the same area, the %K crosses %D from the bottom, thus,
confirming the primary signal.

We enter the market at the opening of the next candle (the blue line) at
1.17444. The stop-loss is set slightly below the minimum of the touch
candle, and the take profit is at the upper boundary - 1.17808.

In a while, the price declines, almost touching the stop-loss level, but
it turns around and surges. The trade is closed at the take profit level
(the red circle). The final profit is 364 points (1.17808 - 1.17444 =
.00364).

### [Stochastic Oscillator](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/stochastic-oscillator.html) vs. RSI

The stochastic oscillator and the relative strength index (RSI) are
often compared. This is partly due to their popularity. Professional
traders widely use both indicators. Still, besides their popularity,
they have many other similarities:

  1. They are oscillators.
  2. They reflect the speed of the price change.
  3. They provide the same signals: overbought/oversold zones, divergence/convergence.
  4. They are flexible: useful on any timeframe and for any market.

Meanwhile, they have many differences:

  1. Settings. The RSI has only one setting; it's a period of the moving average. The stochastic has four parameters.
  2. There are unique signals. Traders widely use a cross of the stochastic oscillator’s %K and %D curves. The RSI doesn't have a smoothing moving average. However, the relative strength index is used to set support and resistance levels. We can apply graphical analysis for this indicator.
  3. Standard overbought/oversold levels for stochastic are 80/20; for the RSI, 70/30.

I would not advise beginner traders to combine the RSI and stochastic
oscillator. Both tools are based on the measure of price dynamics.
That's why signals won't vary a lot. If using them together, they will
likely confuse you due to the high frequency of alerts and fake signals.

Nevertheless, we can't compare the stochastic and the RSI. Each of them
is unique and valuable for traders.

If you want to learn more about the relative strength index (RSI) and
related trading systems, I recommend reading this [article][10].

## [Stochastic Oscillator](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/stochastic-oscillator.html) FAQ

What is the best setting for a stochastic oscillator?

Three main parameters set the oscillator. The period of %K line defines
the range that the indicator will use to compare the current price. The
%D line period determines the smoothing of the %K curve to get the slow
stochastic.  
  
The slowdown smoothes the major period of the %K line, thus, affecting
it. For short timeframes (including H1), the standard settings are (5,
3, 3) or (7, 3, 3). (9, 3, 3), (14, 3, 3) and (21, 3, 3) settings are
useful on H4, [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/), and bigger timeframes.

## [Stochastic Oscillator](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/stochastic-oscillator.html) Сonclusions

There are no 100% accurate instruments of technical analysis. The
stochastic indicator confirms this. It provides plenty of signals, but
some of them are false.

You can minimize this limitation using two methods:

  * Find practical settings for the trading instrument and the timeframe; and
  * Filter stochastic signals with other tools of the technical analysis.

Reversal candlestick patterns and chart patterns, such as triangles and
“Head and Shoulders,” are the best for signal confirmation. It's highly
recommended to implement the stochastic oscillator with other trend
indicators. It helps avoid numerous fake signals. Take time to learn
more about the trading strategy of stochastic with [Bollinger Bands](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/bollinger-bands.html).

The stochastic oscillator is an excellent tool due to the number of
adjustable parameters and the simplicity of the supplied signals. So,
you should practice it to get high-quality trading alerts. Despite how
long ago it was invented, the stochastic oscillator is a perfect
supplement of any strategy today.
