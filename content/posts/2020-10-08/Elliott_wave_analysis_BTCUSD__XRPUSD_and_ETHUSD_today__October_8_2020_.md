Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 08.10.2020Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I suggest entry signals
to trade each cryptocurrency.

Bitcoin and Ethereum are now at the beginning of the bullish impulse
waves. Therefore, prices should be rising. I recommend entering
purchases under the current conditions.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

 ****

The BTCUSD market is forming the upward linking wave [X] as a double
zigzag, with wave (Y) developing inside. The (Y) wave is also a double
zigzag W-X-Y. The sub-waves W and X have completed, and there is forming
the final motive wave Y as a zigzag [a]-[b]-[c]. The bear corrective
wave [b] seems to have completed, and the price is now rising. The
market should be running up in the [c] impulse to a level of 11315.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 10639.75, TP 11315.00

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

 ****

At the most recent section of the XRPUSD chart, there is forming the
upward corrective wave B. The B wave is a zigzag composed of three major
sub-waves [a]-[b]-[c]. Wave [a] is a simple impulse, wave [b] is a
correction, developed as zigzag (a)-(b)-(c). Wave [c] is still unfolding
as an impulse composed of five sub-waves (1)-(2)-(3)-(4)-(5). The first
four parts of this impulse have completed. The market should be rising
in the final wave (5) to a level of 0.266.

### Trading plan for **[XRPUSD][2]** today:

Buy 0.246, TP 0.266

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

 ****

The market is now forming the initial part of the down impulse wave. The
first sub-wave of the downtrend, wave [1], has finished as an impulse.
There is now forming the corrective wave [2] as a zigzag. Wave (A) is a
bullish impulse with the corrective wave 4, formed as a skewed expanding
triangle. Wave (B) is a simple zigzag a-b-c. The ETHUSD market should be
rising in the final wave (C) towards the level of 374.61.

### Trading plan  **[ETHUSD][3] **today:

Buy 339.25, TP 374.61
