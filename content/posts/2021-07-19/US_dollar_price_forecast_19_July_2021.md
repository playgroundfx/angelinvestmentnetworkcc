Dollar stays determined. Forecast as of 19.07.2021Dmitri Demidenko

The euro doesn’t grow despite the increase in the German producer
prices, positive change in the euro-area PMI, and the dispute among the
ECB members. The [EURUSD][1] bulls seem to be weak. Let us discuss the
Forex outlook and make up a trading plan.

## Weekly US dollar fundamental forecast

The [EURUSD][2] bears have been trying to lower the price below 1.18 but
fail to consolidate. What is holding back the US dollar? Markets trust
in the Fed; Treasury yields do not grow, discouraging foreign [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s
from buying US assets. Besides, the euro seems to have the chance to
recover.

At first glance, everything looks more than logical. The change in the
Fed's tone, which since mid-June no longer wants to remain passive. The
US central bankers are willing to control inflation growth. Therefore,
the [EURUSD][2] uptrend is broken. Traders are actively exiting dollar
shorts, so the USD is rising. Furthermore, before the summit in Jackson
Hole, where Jerome Powell is likely to announce the tapering of the US
QE, the dollar bulls are likely to add up to the longs, buying the [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/).

### Dynamics of USD and dollar speculative positions

Unlike the Fed, which is about to start scaling back the monetary
stimulus, the ECB will hardly quit the asset purchases program. The
share of Bloomberg experts predicting that the central bank will spend
money on PEPP in full increased from 40% to 52% in July. It is expected
that the pandemic emergency purchase program will end in March 2022.
Still, after its expiration, the pace of another, earlier QE will
increase from €20 billion to €30 billion per month. This is confirmed by
Christine Lagarde, who speaks about the new PEPP format after its
expiration. Thus, the monetary stimulus in Europe will hardly end soon,
which in theory should press down the euro.

Along with the divergence in monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), the fact that the United
States is growing faster also contributes to the [EURUSD][2] downtrend.
According to the consensus forecast of Wall Street Journal experts, the
US economy will expand by 6.9% in 2021. Yes, in 2022 and 2023, there
will be a slowdown to 3.2% and 2.3%, but this is a completely different
story. This scenario will be relevant at the end of this year and in the
first half of next year.

### Forecasts for US GDP

The problem is that the divergence in monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) and economic
growth affects long-term trends, but anything can happen in the medium-
term investment period. No asset can rise or fall all the time.
Greenback is set back because Treasury yields do not grow, reducing US
assets' appeal for foreign buyers. In addition, Wall Street Journal
economists predict a slowdown in US inflation from 4.1% at the end of
2021 to 2.5% at the end of 2022, which will prove the Fed's correct
position, suggesting the rate hikes only in 2023.

### Weekly [EURUSD][2] trading plan

Will the [EURUSD][2] bulls go ahead this week? It seems that the euro
should strengthen amid the increase in Germany’s producer prices,
positive change in the euro-area PMI, and a dispute among the ECB
members. Nonetheless, the number of [EURUSD][2] sellers increases, so
the upward corrections will be used to sell the pair towards 1.1715 and
1.1665.
