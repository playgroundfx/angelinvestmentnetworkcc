Four reasons to get rid of Aussie. Forecast as of 19.07.2021Dmitri
Demidenko

Leaders often become outsiders in the market. If in 2020 the Australian
dollar was on the rise, then in 2021 the [AUDUSD][1] uptrend was broken
out. Why did it happen? Let's figure it out and make up the [AUDUSD][1]
trading plan

## Monthly Australian dollar fundamental forecast

The events in Australia once again prove that the only way to defeat the
pandemic is vaccination. It would seem that Australia was able to
quickly identify and isolate COVID-19 patients due to its territorial
distance from the rest of the world. However, the slow introduction of
vaccines and the emergence of new centers of infection have led to
lockdowns in Sydney and Melbourne, which may cause stagnation and
acceleration of the [AUDUSD][1] fall.

It would seem that good [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) from the labor market should have improved
the mood of the Australian dollar buyers. Unemployment in June fell to a
10-year low of 4.9%, employment gain was better than expected, and the
participation rate remained at 66.2%. The labor market has not only
recovered from the pandemic, but it also continues to improve, which
should potentially further accelerate the economy. In reality,
everything looks different.

### Dynamics of unemployment and wages in Australia

Sydney accounts for about 22% of the total workforce and 25% of GDP.
HSBC claims Australia's economy will stagnate in the second half of
2021, contracting by 0.3% in the third quarter and growing by 0.3% in
the fourth. The main reasons include declining population flows due to
closed borders, tensions with China, depleting fiscal stimulus and, of
course, new COVID-19 outbreaks.

In Australia, 11% of the adult population is fully vaccinated, which is
very low compared to the UK (54%), the US (48.5%) and the EU (42.4%).
Lockdowns will significantly slow down Australia's economy, while US
GDP, according to Wall Street Journal experts, is capable of
accelerating to 9.1% in the second quarter and to 7% in the third
quarter of 2021. The discrepancy in GDP growth rates is complemented by
divergence in monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), which explains the strength of the
[AUDUSD][1] downtrend.

The RBA officials are unhappy with the slow growth of inflation, unlike
the Fed, which, due to the acceleration of consumer prices, is
discussing the issue of QE tapering and does not exclude an increase in
the federal funds rate in 2022. Although the RBA announced a reduction
in weekly asset purchases from AU$5 billion to AU$4 billion from
October, it does not intend to get rid of monetary stimulus. At the same
time, Philip Lowe and his colleagues do not plan to raise the cash rate
before 2024.

Do not forget about the slowdown in the economy of China, which is
Australia's main trading partner. In the second quarter, the growth rate
of the PRC's GDP decreased from 18.3% to 7.9% against the forecast of
8.1%. Beijing is reducing monetary stimulus and fighting tech companies
which no sector of the Chinese economy is able to replace.

### Monthly [AUDUSD][1] trading plan

Thus, lockdowns, divergences in economic growth and in monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
in Australia and the United States, as well as a slowdown in China's
GDP, create prerequisites for the continuation of the [AUDUSD][1]
downtrend in the direction of 0.729 and 0.719. Hold and periodically add
up on corrections short trades formed on the breakout of [the support at
0.7685][2] and when the price rebounds from [the resistance at 0.76][3].
