Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 19.07.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

The BTCUSD market should be forming the bullish zigzag-shaped wave over
the next few days. The ETHUSD should be developing the bullish impulse.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

The BTCUSD market must be forming corrective wave [B] as a double zigzag
(W)-(X)-(Y). The descending linking wave (X) must have completed as a
triple zigzag W-X-Y-X-Z. Therefore, there is unfolding the initial part
of wave (Y). The price should soon reach level 34700.00, the high made
by wave X, and go higher. One could enter purchases in the current
situation.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 31516.50, TP 34700.00

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

The XRPUSD is forming the bullish double zigzag, with the first sub-wave
W completed inside. There is developing the linking wave X, which could
finish soon. The X is likely to be a triple zigzag [W]-[X]-[Y]-[X]-[Z].
The (C) impulse should soon conclude the motive wave [Z] at a level of
0.557, marked by the bear impulse (A). Next, the market should turn up
and start rising.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] **** today:

Sell 0.580, TP 0.557

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

The ETHUSD pair is developing a large upward correction B as a simple
zigzag [A]-[B]-[C]. The market must have completed the bearish
correction [B] as a zigzag composed of three sub-waves (A)-(B)-(C). The
price has recently finished declining in the ending diagonal 5, which is
the final leg in the impulse wave (C). There is unfolding the initial
part of the upward impulse wave [C]. The price could rise above the high
of 2172.00, marked by the (B) correction.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Buy 1880.30, TP 2172.00
