Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 19.07.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

Last week, the euro price tried to correct to the zone of ​​short-term
downtrend's key resistance 1.1879-1.1860.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

Oil price continues to fall within a short-term downtrend. The target of
the fall is the Target Zone 69.63 - 69.10.

Last week, traders tested the strong resistance which is Additional
Zone. A downward impulse from this zone is now developing. If the local
low is updated, the resistance will be considered irrelevant, and there
will be a need for the formation of new resistance zones.

Today wait for the formation of the sell pattern and sell oil according
to it.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

Sell according to the pattern in Additional Zone 71.58 - 71.44.
TakeProfit: 70.13. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

Last week, the gold corrective pattern worked out perfectly. First, the
price broke out the support level of 1819 and consolidated below it.
Then, after the correction to the new Additional Zone 1827 - 1826,
traders began to accumulate positions. At the US trading session, the
price reached the Intermediary Zone 1811-1809.

Now traders are trying to break out the Intermediary Zone which serves
as the short-term uptrend's border. If the zone is broken out, then it
will be possible to consider sales down to the lower Target Zone 1789 -
1784.

If the Intermediary Zone is held, then enter purchases according to the
pattern with the target at level 1832.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

Buy according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 1811 - 1809.
TakeProfit: 1832. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

Last week, the euro price tried to correct to the zone of ​​short-term
downtrend's key resistance 1.1879-1.1860. However, buyers were not
strong enough to reach the correction target.

On Thursday-Friday, the euro price fell and tested the Additional Zone
1.1806 - 1.1802. Still, the zone is being held, but there is no buy
pattern. Therefore, it is not yet possible to consider long trades.

If level 1.1793 is broken out, the Additional Zone will also be broken
out. In this case, I recommend entering short trades with the target in
the zone of ​​1.1762 - 1.1753.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

Sell when level 1.1793 is broken out. TakeProfit: 1.1762. StopLoss:
1.1808.
