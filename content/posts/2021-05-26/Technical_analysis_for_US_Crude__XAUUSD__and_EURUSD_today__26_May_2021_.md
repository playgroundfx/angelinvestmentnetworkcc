Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 26.05.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

Gold has successfully reached its main buy target – Target Zone 2
1903-1898.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

Oil is trading in a short-term uptrend. The growth target is the Target
Zone 67.34 - 66.81. Yesterday, the price corrected and tested the Micro-
zone 65.59 - 65.52. The zone was held and, as a result, the local high
was updated.

A new Micro-zone 65.75 - 65.68 was drawn down from yesterday's high. The
correction has reached this support. The traders are now accumulating
positions. To form a buy pattern, it is required to break out the
resistance level of 66.01.

A breakout of level 65.57 and price consolidation below is required for
oil sales. In this case, it will be possible to assume the development
of the correction down to the Additional Zone 65.08 - 64.95.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

Buy according to the pattern in Micro-zone 65.75 - 65.68. TakeProfit:
Target Zone 67.34 - 66.81. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

Gold has successfully reached its main buy target – Target Zone 2
1903-1898. Further growth will be possible if the zone is broken out and
the pair consolidates above at the US session. In this case, the target
will be the Gold Zone 1923 - 1921.

Now the bears are trying to start the gold price correction. If a
corrective pattern develops, a test of the Additional Zone 1896 - 1895
can be expected. After testing the zone, focus on looking for a buy
pattern. The purchase target will be the day's high.

If the Additional Zone is broken out, then the correction will continue
with the target in the Intermediary Zone 1885 - 1883.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

Buy according to the pattern in Additional Zone 1896 - 1895. TakeProfit:
1906. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

Yesterday, euro traders tried to break out the Target Zone 1.2245 -
1.2227. It didn't work out the first time. If it works out today, then
the next buy target within the short-term uptrend will be the Gold Zone
1.2324 - 1.2315.

It is reasonable to consider new euro purchases on correction at strong
supports: Additional Zone 1.2222 - 1.2218 and Intermediary Zone 1.2178 -
1.2169. The trend border is at level 1.2164. The resistance level 1.2260
can be used as a buy target.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

  1. Open buy positions according to the pattern in 1.2234 - 1.2218. TakeProfit: 1.2260, Gold Zone 1.2324 - 1.2315.

  2. Buy according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 1.2178 - 1.2169. TakeProfit: 1.2260. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.
