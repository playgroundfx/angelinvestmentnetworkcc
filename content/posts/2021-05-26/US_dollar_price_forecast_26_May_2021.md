Dollar is scared by printing press. Forecast as of 26.05.2021Dmitri
Demidenko

The dollar is pressed down by the combination of soaring inflation and
the Fed’s ultra-easy monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). The growing number of vaccinations
in the EU and China’s support encourage the euro bulls to go ahead. I do
not think so. Let us discuss the Forex outlook and make up a [EURUSD][1]
trading plan.

## Monthly US dollar fundamental forecast

Investors try to predict the future and look back at the past only in
order not to repeat their mistakes. Germany’s GDP contracted by 1.8%
Q-o-Q in the first quarter, which was worse than Reuters experts had
expected. However, the German economy can accelerate significantly in
the second one, which is confirmed by the exceeding of all forecasts by
the IFO business climate index except one in the Bloomberg poll. Does
the growth gap between the US and the euro area matter if everything can
radically change in April-June due to the changes in the vaccination
rates?

The Fed continues to flood financial markets with cheap liquidity, which
is essentially equivalent to a printing press, and rising inflation
presses down the purchasing power of the national currency. So, the US
dollar is naturally falling. The Fed insists on patience, and even the
words of Vice President Richard Clarida that the time will come when the
Fed can discuss the tapering of the QE, and it depends on the incoming
data, has not particularly scared the financial markets. They heard
nothing new in this speech. The President of the Federal Reserve Bank of
San Francisco, Mary Daly, says that the Fed’s officials “are talking
about talking about tapering,” which neither provides anything new.

Investors are focused on the vaccination acceleration in the EU, which
could push the euro-area GDP up to 9.2% in the second quarter. After
all, everything is about the degree. The EURUSD bears should be more
concerned about the fact that the vaccination campaign in the US is
slowing down. The first to inoculate were the ones who were willing to
receive the vaccine. Now, some people have doubts about whether to be
vaccinated.

The US dollar could have been supported by the drop in the US stock
indexes amid the inflation surge and weak reports on US consumer
confidence and new single-family homes sales. However, the [S&P 500][2]
uptrend has not exhausted yet, and it could reach 4,300 in 2021,
according to the median forecast of 46 strategists polled by Reuters.

Unlike the greenback, the euro is also supported by foreign [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/). The
Chinese yuan has reached its three-year high as the _People's Bank of
China_ doesn’t react to the [USDCNH][3] drop. Beijing is trying to fight
the rise in commodity prices, also by strengthening the national
currency, which improves the position of importers.

### Monthly [EURUSD][1] trading plan

The [EURUSD][1] bulls go ahead amid several factors. The Fed is willing
to maintain its ultra-easy monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), the growth gap between the
USA and the euro-area is narrowing, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s doubt that the US economy
will fulfill its ambitious goals. Besides, China provides support for
the euro as well. The euro has reached the target indicated in one of
the [previous materials][4] at 1.226 and seems to continue the rally
towards $1.24 and $1.255. It is still relevant to add up to the longs.
