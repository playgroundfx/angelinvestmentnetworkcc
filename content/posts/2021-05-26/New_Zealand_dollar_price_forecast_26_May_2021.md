Kiwi prepared a surprise. Forecast as of 26.05.2021Dmitri Demidenko

While New Zealand tops the Bloomberg pandemic resilience rating, its
central bank is set to normalize monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) ahead of the Fed. What
will this mean for [NZDUSD][1] and [AUDNZD][2]? Let us discuss the Forex
outlook and make up a trading plan.

## Quarterly New Zealand dollar fundamental forecast

Investors are used to the fact that central banks do not act alone, they
move like a pack led by the Fed. As soon as some wolf-regulator
separates from the pack, the attention to its currency increases. This
was the case with the Canadian dollar and the Norwegian krone in
connection with the intentions of Ottawa and Oslo to go against the Fed
and normalize monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) before the US regulator. The Reserve Bank
of New Zealand is ready to become the next renegade. This turned out to
be a real surprise not only for the NZD but for the entire Forex market.

At its May meeting, RBNZ officials made it clear that the bank could
raise its key interest rate in September 2022. The RBNZ expects the cash
rate to reach 1.5% and 1.78% by the end of 2023 and 2024, respectively.
This fact fuels the expectation that the recent New Zealand positive
economic data will push the central bank to tighten monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).
This applies to the growth of April business activity in the service
sector from 52.9 to 61.2, the highest level since 2009; acceleration of
producer prices in the first quarter from 0.1% to 2.1%; retail sales
growth of 2.5% QoQ in January-March, as well as a significant
improvement in the trade balance in April.

It should be noted that New Zealand tops the Bloomberg coronavirus
resistance rating. For comparison, Australia is 3rd, China - 9th, Great
Britain - 11th, and the US - 13th. Wellington's success has a positive
effect on the country's economy. At the same time, the introduction of
restrictions by Canberra in connection with the new COVID-19 outbreak
serves as one of the bearish drivers for [AUDNZD][2].

The facts that New Zealand is successfully fighting the pandemic, and
its central bank decided to separate from the pack and follow the
example of the central banks of Canada and Norway, allow us to consider
the Kiwi rate undervalued. Even though the vaccination rate in New
Zealand is still rather low, the number the infections and death rates
are very low.

Unlike Australia, New Zealand is too small to wage a trade war with
China, and Fonterra's positive outlook for milk prices in 2022 is good
[news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) for the Kiwi’s economy and currency. While Beijing is limited to
only verbal warnings, since Canberra is quite successful in diversifying
its sales markets, nevertheless, the very fact of tense diplomatic
relations with the main trading partner discourages the AUDNZD bulls.

### Quarterly [NZDUSD][1] and [AUDNZD][2] trading plan

In my opinion, the rise of the New Zealand dollar in response to RBNZ's
hawkish stance is just the beginning. Leaving the pack will close the
Kiwi's lag behind the Canadian dollar and the Norwegian krone in the
race for the G10 performer of the year. In such conditions, the
[AUDNZD][2] pair risks falling to the zone of 1.049-1.0515 within the
next three months. I recommend selling the pair. If the [NZDUSD][1]
bulls manage to consolidate the price above 0.7275, the likelihood of
the rally continuation to 0.744 and 0.7525 will increase significantly,
which creates preconditions for the longs formation.
