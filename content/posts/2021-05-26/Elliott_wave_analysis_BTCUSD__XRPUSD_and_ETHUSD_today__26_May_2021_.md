Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 26.05.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency

The cryptocurrency pairs have started forming the final impulses in
bullish zigzags.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

By May 10, the BTCUSD market completed the zigzag-shaped correction 2.
Next, the price started declining. There could be unfolding the initial
part of a new impulse. The market must have completed the impulse down
wave [1], and the price is rising in the bullish correction [2]. Wave
[2] is likely to be a simple zigzag. Impulse (A) and correction (B) seem
to be complete, so the market will be rising in the impulse wave (C).
The price could reach level 48300.00. At this level, wave [2] will be
61.8% of wave [1].

The XRPUSD market is forming a large double zigzag. Wave (W) is composed
of three major sub-waves A-B-C. Impulse wave A and correction B have
competed. Corrective wave B is a double zigzag. The impulse down wave C

bearish wave 1 completed as an impulse. Next, there have finished two
sub-waves [A]-[B] of the zigzag-shaped correction 2. There should be
developing impulse [C], as it is outlined in the chart. The Ethereum
