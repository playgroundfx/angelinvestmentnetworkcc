Economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the week 26.07.2021 – 01.08.2021Jana Kane

##  **Review of the main events of the Forex economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the
next trading week (26.07.2021 – 01.08.2021)**

 **Trading on key Forex [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/): next week we expect the publication of
important macro statistics from Germany, Australia, Canada, the US, the
Eurozone, as well as the results of the meeting of the US central bank
devoted to monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) issues.**

Despite high volatility and a sharp decline at the beginning of last
week, the dollar and major US stock indices still went up.

The dollar is in demand as a defensive asset amid concerns about the
continued spread of the coronavirus, and continued positive macro data
from the US support stock indices.

The dollar continues to strengthen little by little, despite assurances
from the Fed leaders that the time has not yet come to roll back the
stimulating [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).

Earlier, the Fed officials have repeatedly stated that they will not
slow down the rate of bond purchases until they see "significant further
progress" in achieving the inflation target of 2% and the labor market
reaching pre-crisis (before the pandemic) levels.

However, it is increasingly difficult for Fed leaders to contain the
dollar's strengthening amid rising inflation, which has shown record
growth rates over the past 29 years. Sooner or later, they will have to
start curtailing the stimulating [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). In this regard, next week's
meeting of the Fed will be of particular interest. It will end on
Wednesday with the publication of the decision on rates.

Earlier, the Fed officials said that they would warn the markets in
advance about the curtailment of stimulus. Therefore, most likely, they
are unlikely to start the curtailment at this meeting.

Nevertheless, the intrigue around the intentions and actions of the Fed
remains, since after the meeting in June, 13 out of 18 Fed leaders
predicted a rate hike before the end of 2023, and 7 - before the end of
2022.

Next week, financial market participants will also pay attention to the
publication of important macro statistics from Germany, Australia,
Canada, the United States, and the Eurozone.

 ***during the coming week, new events may be added to the [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) and
/ or some scheduled events may be canceled**

 ****GMT time**

###  **Monday, July 26**

No important macro statistics planned to be released.

###  **Tuesday, July 27**

###  **07:30 JPY Speech by the Head of the Bank of Japan Haruhiko
Kuroda**

In his speech, the head of the Bank of Japan Haruhiko Kuroda will give
some comments on the bank's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). "It is necessary to
patiently continue to ease the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)," - Kuroda said almost
traditionally. Markets usually react noticeably to Kuroda's speeches if
he touches on the topic of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) and makes unexpected
statements. Volatility at such moments usually grows not only in the yen
trade, but throughout the Asian and global financial markets. If he does
not touch on monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) issues, the reaction to his speech will be
weak.

###  **12:30 USD Durable goods orders. Capital goods orders (ex defense
and aviation)**

This indicator reflects the value of orders received by manufacturers of
durable goods and capital goods (capital goods are durable commodities
used to produce durable goods and services) involving large investments.
Commodities produced in the defense and aviation sectors of the US
economy are not included in this indicator. A strong result strengthens
the USD. Previous values ​​of the "durable goods orders" indicator:
+2.3% in May, -1.3% in April, +1% in March, -1.2% in February, +3.4% in
January 2021 , +1.2% in December, +1.3% in November, +1.8% in October,
-18.3% in April, -16.7% in March, +2.0% in February, - 0.2% in January
2020.

Previous values ​​of the indicator "capital goods orders ex defense and
aviation": +0.1% in May, +2.2% in April, + 1% in March, -0.9% in
February, + 0.6% in January 2021, +1.5% in December, +1.2% in November,
+1.9% in September, +2.1% in August, -6.6% in April, -1.3% in March,
-0.6% in February, +0.9% in January 2020.

In theory, the relative growth of the indicator has a positive effect on
the dollar; the market reaction to its negative value may be negative
for the dollar in the short term. Data worse than the previous value
will also negatively affect the dollar quotes.

Forecast for June: +2.1% (durable goods orders), +0.6% (capital goods
orders ex defense and aviation).

It seems that the growth of indicators continues after their recovery in
previous months from a strong drop in March and April 2020, which should
have a positive effect on the dollar quotes. Better-than-expected data
will also have a positive impact on the dollar.

###  **Wednesday, July 28**

###  **01:30 AUD RBA trimmed mean core inflation index (Q2). Consumer
Price Index (Q2)**

This indicator is published by the RBA and the Australian Bureau of
Statistics. It reflects the dynamics of retail prices of goods and
services included in the consumer basket. The simple trimmed mean method
takes into account the weighted average kernel, the central 70% of the
index components. Previous index values: +0.3% (+1.1% on an annualized
basis) in the 1st quarter of 2021, +0.4% (+1.2% on an annualized basis)
in the 4th quarter of 2020. According to the forecast, it is expected
that the value of the indicator for the 2nd quarter of 2021 will be
+0.5% (+1.6% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)). Despite the relative growth, this is
still a weak value. If the value of the indicator turns out to be worse
than the forecast, it is likely to further negatively affect the AUD.
The data indicate low inflationary pressures in the country. The growth
of the indicator above the forecast should have a positive effect on the
AUD in the short term.

Consumer Price Inflation Index (CPI) published by the RBA and the
Australian Bureau of Statistics measures the dynamics of retail prices
for goods and services in Australia. CPI is the most significant
indicator of inflation and changes in consumer preferences. A high
reading is positive for the AUD, while a low reading is negative.
Previous values ​​of the indicator: +0.6% (+1.1% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) in the
1st quarter of 2021, +0.9% (+0.9% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) in the 4th quarter of
2020. According to the forecast, it is expected that the value of the
indicator for the 2nd quarter of 2021 will be +0.9% (+1.4% in annual
[terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)). The expected positive reading is unlikely to provide significant
support for the AUD, indicating low inflationary pressures in the
Australian economy. If the indicator comes out with a value worse than
expected, it is likely to put pressure on the AUD.

###  **12:30 CAD Consumer price indices in Canada**

Core CPI from the Bank of Canada reflects the dynamics of the retail
prices of the corresponding basket of goods and services (excluding
fruits, vegetables, gasoline, fuel oil, natural gas, mortgage interest,
intercity transportation, and tobacco products). The inflation target
for the Bank of Canada is in the range of 1-3%. The rise in CPI is a
harbinger of a rate hike and a positive factor for the CAD. Core
Consumer Price Index increased in May 2021 by +0.4% (+2.8% in annual
[terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)), in January 2021 by +1.6%, in December 2020 by +0.7%, in November
by +1.5%, in October and September +1.0% (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)). If the data
for June turns out to be worse than the previous values, it will
negatively affect the CAD. The data better than the previous values will
strengthen the Canadian dollar. Forecast: Core CPI rose +2.4% in June
(YoY), which is likely to have a positive impact on the CAD despite the
relative decline in the indicator.

###  **18:00 USD The Fed's decision on the interest rate. Comments on
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)**

In March 2020, the Fed sharply lowered the interest rate (to 0.25% from
1.75% in February), and also announced the allocation of $700 billion
for the purchase of US government bonds and mortgage-backed securities.
Subsequently, the Fed has repeatedly announced additional measures to
support the American economy and inject cheap liquidity into the
financial system. Usually, with the easing of the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), the
national currency becomes cheaper and its quotations go down.

In 2020, the dollar declined as [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s withdrew funds from defensive
assets, buying more risky and profitable assets on the stock market,
which continued to grow despite the threat of a second wave of the
coronavirus epidemic and the associated economic slowdown. The role of
the dollar as a defensive asset was also declining. However, in 2021,
the dollar has been strengthening, which is associated with an increase
in the yield of US government bonds, and the Fed has not yet responded
to this in any way.

The rate is widely expected to remain at 0.25% at this meeting.
Nevertheless, during the period of publication of the decision on the
rate, volatility may sharply increase throughout the financial market,
primarily in the American stock market and in the dollar quotes,
especially if the decision on the rate differs from the forecast or
unexpected statements are received from the Fed leaders.

Powell's comments may affect both short-term and long-term USD trading.
A more hawkish stance on the Fed's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) is seen as positive
and strengthening the US dollar, while a more cautious position is seen
as negative for the USD. Investors are eager to hear Powell's views on
the Fed's future plans for this year.

###  **18:30 USD** **Press conference of the FOMC**

The press conference of the US Federal Open Market Committee lasts about
an hour. The first part contains the reading of the ruling, followed by
a series of questions and answers that can increase market volatility.
Any hints by Powell about the possibility of a change in the current
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) will cause an increase in volatility in the dollar
quotes and in the American stock market.

###  **Thursday, July 29**

###  **12:00 EUR Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) in Germany
(preliminary release)**

This index is published by the EU Statistical Office and is calculated
on the basis of a statistical method agreed between all EU countries. It
is an indicator for assessing inflation and is used by the Governing
Council of the ECB to assess the level of price stability. A positive
result strengthens the EUR, a negative one weakens it.

Preliminary forecast for July: +3.0% (against +2.1% in June, +2.4% in
May, +2.1% in April, +2.0% in March, +1.6% in January and February,
-0.7% in December and negative values ​​in the second half of 2020) in
annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/). If the data turn out to be better than the forecast, the
euro may strengthen in the short term. The growth of the indicator is a
positive factor for the euro. The data suggests increasing inflationary
pressures in Germany. The data worse than the forecast and the previous
value will negatively affect the euro.

###  **12:30 USD US Annual GDP for Q2 (preliminary release)**

GDP data are one of the key indicators (along with data on the labor
market and inflation) for the Fed in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of its monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).
Strong result strengthens the US dollar; weak GDP report negatively
affects the US dollar. In the previous 1st quarter, GDP grew by +6.4%,
in the 4th quarter - by +4.3% after growing by +33.4% in the 3rd quarter
of 2020, and after falling by -31. 4% in Q2 and -5.0% in Q1 2020.

If the data points to a decline in GDP in the 2nd quarter, the dollar
will come under pressure. The positive data on GDP will support the
dollar and the American stock indices, although they are already mostly
priced in. Preliminary forecast for Q2 2021: +8.2%.

###  **Friday, July 30**

###  **06:00 EUR Germany GDP for Q2 (preliminary release)**

GDP is considered the most important indicator of the overall health of
the economy. The growing trend in the GDP indicator is considered
positive for the national currency. The German economy is the locomotive
of the entire European economy. A high value of GDP is considered a
positive factor for the EUR, while a low one is considered negative.

The growth of the European and German economies slowed sharply in 2019,
and in 2020 the European economy has already entered a recession in many
ways. The risk of a coronavirus pandemic has been added to the domestic
political risks after Brexit.

If the GDP data turns out to be weaker than the forecast, it will put
even more downward pressure on the euro. Better-than-expected data may
strengthen the euro in the short term. However, the risks for the euro
are directed towards its further weakening.

Forecast: German GDP grew by +2.0% in the 2nd quarter (+10% in annual
[terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)).

###  **09:00 EUR Eurozone GDP for the 2nd quarter (first estimate).
Consumer Price Index. Core CPI (preliminary release)**

GDP is considered to be an indicator of the overall health of the
economy. The upward trend in GDP is considered positive for the EUR; a
poor result weakens the EUR.

Recently, macro data from the Eurozone have been indicating a gradual
recovery in the growth rate of the European economy after a sharp drop
in early 2020.

Thus, according to the forecast of economists, GDP growth in the
Eurozone is expected in the 2nd quarter of 2021 by +1.5% (+13.2% in
annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) after falling by -0.3% (by -1.3% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)). ) in Q1
2021, -0.7% (-4.9% YoY) in Q4 2020, +12.5% ​​growth (-4.3% YoY decline)
[terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) in the 3rd quarter, a fall of -11.8% (-14.7% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) in
the 2nd quarter and a fall of -3.6% (-3.1% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) in the 1st
quarter of 2020.

If the data turn out to be weaker than the forecast, the euro may
decline. Better-than-forecast data may strengthen the euro in the short
term, although it is still far from the full recovery of the European
economy even to pre-crisis levels (quarterly growth within 0.2% - 0.4%).

Consumer Price Index (CPI) is published by Eurostat and measures the
price change of a selected basket of goods and services over a given
period. The index is a key indicator for assessing inflation and changes
in purchasing habits. A positive result strengthens the EUR, a negative
one weakens it. At the end of 2020, the CPI index fell by -0.3%, which
indicates low inflationary pressures and even a slowdown in inflation.
Forecast for July 2021: +2.0% (YoY) against +1.9% in June, +2.0% in May,
+1.3% in March, +0.9% in January and in February. If the data turns out
to be worse than forecast, the euro may fall sharply in the short term.
Data better than the forecast and / or the previous value may strengthen
the euro in the short term. Recall that the target level of consumer
inflation set by the ECB is slightly below 2.0%.

Core Consumer Price Index (Core CPI) determines the change in prices of
a selected basket of goods and services for a given period and is a key
indicator for assessing inflation and changes in consumer preferences.
Food and energy have been excluded from this indicator to provide a more
accurate estimate. A high result strengthens the EUR, while a low result
weakens it. In June 2021, Core CPI rose by +0.9%, +1.0% in May, +0.7% in
April (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) after more modest values ​​of +0.2% in the
period from September to December 2020. If the data for July turn out to
be worse than the previous value or forecast, this may negatively affect
the euro. If the data turn out to be better than the forecast or the
previous value, the euro is likely to react with an increase in
quotations, but only in the short term. Core inflation in the Eurozone
remains low, which is a negative factor for the euro. Forecast for July:
+0.8%.
