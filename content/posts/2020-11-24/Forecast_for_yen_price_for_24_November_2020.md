Yen loses the firm ground. Forecast as of 24.11.2020Dmitri Demidenko

Life is changing, and the markets are changing. In Forex, the winners
could any time become the losers. What will be with the yen? Let's find
it out and make a trading plan for [EURJPY][1], [GBPJPY][2], and
[AUDJPY][3] for six months.

## Fundamental yen forecast for six months

Donald Trump is leaving the White House, and the age of safe havens is
also about to end. The eccentric and unpredictable 45th US president
created an environment of uncertainty in the financial markets, which
supported the safe-haven assets. Amid the trade wars and the pandemic
over the last three years, the Japanese yen has grown 6.4% versus the US
dollar, the Swiss franc – by 6.9%. On the opposite side in the list of
30 most traded Forex currencies are the Turkish lira (-99%), the
Brazilian real (-68%), and the Russian ruble (-30%). Everything can
radically change in 2021.

One of the key drivers for the [USDJPY][4] is the capital flows from
Japan into the USA and vice versa. Over the six months up to September,
overseas stocks' net sales by Japanese [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s totaled ¥3.91 trillion;
net purchases of local government debt are of ¥11.8 trillion. Both
values are the highest since 2013. During the same period, the dollar
was down by 4.5% versus the yen. Furthermore, when the Japanese
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s were actively selling the foreign stocks (- ¥ 4.85 trillion on
a net basis), the [USDJPY][4] was almost 4% down.

Although the US stock indexes were rising, Japan's epidemiological
situation was better than in the USA, and there was uncertainty around
the US presidential election. As a result, insurance companies, pension
funds, and other [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s preferred to sell the US stocks and
repatriate capitals to Japan, pressing the [USDJPY][4] down. In 2021,
the Japanese [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s should display a higher risk appetite amid
Biden’s victory (he will be more predictable than Trump), vaccines, and
global GDP recovery. The capital flows should again outflow from Japan,
making the yen a Forex outsider.

I do not think there is much use in selling the yen versus the US
dollar. First, the greenback is also a safe haven, and the USD outlook
is also bearish for 2021. Second, the US economy can well recover sooner
than Japan’s growth. The US PMI has shown the best growth since March
2015, while Japan’s PMI remains weak.

### Trading plan for [EURJPY][1], [GBPJPY][2], and [AUDJPY][3] for six
months

It makes sense to sell the yen versus the euro, the pound, and the
Australian dollar. A Brexit deal will support the euro and the sterling.
If the pandemic is stopped, the EUR and the GBP could repeat the rallies
that occurred in the May-August period. China and commodities will
support the Aussie. Under such conditions, it seems promising to buy the
[EURJPY][1], [GBPJPY][2], and [AUDJPY][3] with the targets of 126.4 and
128.5, 142.5 and 144.7, 79.5 and 82.4 in three and six months,
respectively.
