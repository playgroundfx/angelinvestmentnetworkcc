Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 24.11.2020Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I suggest entry signals
to trade each cryptocurrency.

All cryptocurrency pairs should soon decline in corrective sub-waves.
Next, the cryptocurrency market should resume rising.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

 ****

The Bitcoin market continues forming the global double combination. In
the upward wave (Y) that a simple zigzag A-B-C, the first two elements
have completed. The price is rising in the bullish impulse wave C. There
is forming the down corrective wave [4] as a simple zigzag (a)-(b)-(c),
which should shortly end. Next, the Bitcoin price should be rising in
the final wave [5] towards a level of 20000.00.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 17590.00, TP 20000.00

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

 ****

There is forming the bullish linking wave [X] as a double zigzag. There
is unfolding wave (Y) as a standard zigzag A-B-C. When the bearish
correction B ended as a triple zigzag [w]-[x]-[y]-[x]-[z], the price has
started rising in the final impulse C. The impulse wave [3] should have
finished, and the market is likely to go down a little in the corrective
wave [4]. Next, the market should resume rising in the final wave [5] to
a level of 0.650.

### Trading plan for **[XRPUSD][2]** today:

Buy 0.599, TP 0.650

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

 ****

The ETHUSD market is also forming the final wave in the bullish double
zigzag. The most recent chart section displays the upward impulse wave C
where the first four elements have completed, and the price is rising in
impulse [5]. There should have finished the impulse wave 3 which is an
element of the sub-wave (5) of [5]. Therefore, the Ethereum price should
decline a little in corrective wave 4. Next, the market will be rising
in the sub-wave 5 towards a level of 653.00, as it is outlined in the
chart.

### Trading plan for  **[ETHUSD][3] **today:

Buy 613.31, TP 653.00
