Weekly forecast for oil, gold and EUR/USDAlex Rodiоnov

###  **USCrude – oil**

Oil price has been corrected in the middle-term uptrend this week. The
correction target is to test Target Zone [31.01 – 30.11]. I expect the
price to reach this zone next week. Once it happens, it will be relevant
to enter new purchases according to the pattern. The buy target will be
to break through the high of this week and Target Zone 5 [41.67 -
40.92].

It will be relevant to sell oil when sellers break out Target Zone and
consolidate the price below at least at two trade sessions. In this
case, the medium-term trend will turn down. However, I do not see any
reasons to discuss it now.

 **[USCrude][2]Trading tips for the upcoming week: **

Buy according to the pattern in Target Zone [31.01 - 30.11]. TakeProfit:
39.75, Target Zone 5 [41.67 -  40.92]. StopLoss: according to the
pattern rules.

###  **XAUUSD – gold**

Last week, I recommended the following, “When the key support is tested,
I suggest looking for a buy pattern and entering purchases with a target
to break through the previous monthly high.”

At the end of last week, on June 5, the price reached the trend key
support [1673.6 – 1664.4]. The buy pattern has emerged this week.

For today and next week, I recommend buying gold according to the false
breakout pattern with the first target at Target Zone 5 [1757.2 –
1751.2], the second target is at May high.

I do not recommend selling gold counter the trend.

###  **EURUSD – euro/dollar**

The EUR/USD is trading in the middle-term uptrend. This week, the price
has consolidated above Target Zone 3 [1.1291 – 1.1273]. The next upside
target is Target Zone 4 [1.1473 – 1.1455].

Next week, we shall expect the test of the trend key support [1.1240 –
1.1222] and look for a buy pattern. If there is a buy pattern, I will
recommend buying the euro with the target at the high of this week and
TZ4.

Otherwise, if the price breaks through the low of last week and Target
Zone [1.1240 – 1.1222], the middle-term trend will turn down. The sell
target in this case will be Target Zone 2 [1.1058 — 1.1040].

 **[EURUSD][6]  Trading tips for the upcoming week: **

TakeProfit: 1.1420, Target Zone 4 [1.1473 - 1.1455]. StopLoss: according
to the pattern rules.

> IZ - Intermediary Zone: responsible for the price momentum reversing

>

> TZ - Target Zone: a zone that is 75% likely to be reached after IZ
breakout.

>

> GZ - Gold Zone: zone in the medium-term momentum.
