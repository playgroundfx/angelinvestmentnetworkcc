Dollar wakes fears upDmitri Demidenko

## Concerns about a second wave of the pandemic increase the demand for
safe havens

The worst drop in the US stock market since mid-march woke up Donald
Trump. The US president says the Fed’s projections look too gloomy, “The
Federal Reserve is wrong so often. I see the numbers also, and do MUCH
better than they do. We will have a very good Third Quarter, a great
Fourth Quarter, and one of our best ever years in 2021”. Earlier, Trump
used to criticize the Fed for too high rates. Now, he is not satisfied
with the central bank’s gloomy projections. He is irritated because of
the S&P 500 drop and the surge of the fear index VIX to the level of
40.79, the highest for more than three months. It is not surprising! The
repeated crash of the US stock indexes ahead of the presidential
election looks like a defeat.

I think it is not fair to blame Jerome Powell and his colleagues for the
stock market drop. One of the key drivers of the US stock market rally
has been the Fed’s ample liquidity and the central bank is unwilling to
change its [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). The Fed will hold the interest rates close to zero
and buy $120 billion of Treasury and mortgage bonds a month. As for the
idea of the Nike-shaped recovery of the US growth, the Fed is supported
not only by the OECD but also by 69% of 62 experts surveyed by the Wall
Street Journal. The analysts have somehow upgraded the forecasts for the
US GDP (from -6.6% in May to -5.9% in June) and unemployment (9.6%, down
from the previous gauge of 11.4%) in late 2020. 68.4% of economists
believe the US economy will start recovering in the third quarter, 22.8%
believe it has already started.

The market was too optimistic about the US economic rebound, however,
the major reason for the S&P 500 sell-offs is the deterioration of the
epidemiological situation. The number of COVID-19 cases in the USA has
exceeded 2 million. The more actively states are reopening the faster is
growing the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) infection rate. There are risks of the second wave of
the pandemic and the fact that the US administration is not going to
shut down the economy again. The US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin
says that shutting down the economy for a second time to combat the
spread of COVID-19 could cause even more damage than the coronavirus.
Therefore, the US stock indexes dropped down.

In early June, markets calmed down. However, the Fed’s grim forecasts
and the concerns about the second wave of coronavirus have resulted in a
new shock. Will the S&P 500 correction result in greater losses or stop
soon? The answer to this question will determine the [EUR/USD][2] trend.
The situation could deteriorate because of bad [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) form China and
Europe. The US-China trade relations are tense, there still might be a
new round of trade wars. Besides, the discussion on the French-German
huge fiscal stimulus at the EU summit could weaken the euro, which now
seems strong.

The euro could fall victim to its success. Almost a 6% rise of the
[EUR/USD][2] has become a symbol that the fears of the coronavirus are
easing all over the world. If those fears start rising again, the euro
bulls will have to step back. I don’t see any reasons for panic, and the
euro drop to $1.122-1.124 and $1.1125-1.1155 will give a good chance to
enter long trades.
