EUR/USD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 12/06/2020 –
19/06/2020Alex Geuta

## The pair [EUR/USD][1] remains likely to grow. Estimated pivot point
is at a level of 1.1240.

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions from corrections above the
level of 1.1240 with a target of 1.1490 – 1.1723.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
1.1240 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of 1.1175
– 1.1097.

 **Analysis:** Supposedly, a descending correction of larger degree
finished developing on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame in the form of wave 2 and
the third wave 3 started developing. On the H4 time frame the first
counter-trend wave 1 of (3) is forming, with wave iii of 1 forming
inside. Apparently, the third wave of smaller degree (iii) of iii of 1
is forming on the H1 time frame, with wave v of (iii) forming inside. If
the presumption is correct, the pair will continue to rise to the levels
of 1.1490 – 1.1723. The level of 1.1240 is critical in this scenario.
Its breakout will allow the pair to continue falling to the levels of
1.1175 – 1.1097.
