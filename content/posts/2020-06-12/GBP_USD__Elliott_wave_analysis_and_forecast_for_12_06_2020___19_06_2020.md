GBP/USD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 12/06/2020 –
19/06/2020Alex Geuta

## The pair [GBP/USD][1] remains likely to grow. Estimated pivot point
is at a level of  1.2485.

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions from corrections above the
level of  1.2485 with a target of 1.2800 – 1.3150.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
1.2485 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of 1.2204
– 1.2069.

 **Analysis:** Supposedly, the fifth wave of larger degree V finished
developing on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame, with wave  (С) of V completed and
the first wave (1) developing inside. On the H4 time frame, wave 1 of
(1) formed, a local correction is completed in the form of wave 2 of
(1), and wave 3 of (1) started developing. Apparently, the first wave of
smaller degree i of 3 is developing on the H1 time frame, with wave
(iii) of i formed and a correction nearing completion in the form of
wave (iv) of i inside. If the presumption is correct, the pair will
continue to rise to the levels of 1.2800 – 1.3150. The level of  1.2485
is critical in this scenario as the breakout will enable the pair to
continue declining to the levels of 1.2204 – 1.2069.
