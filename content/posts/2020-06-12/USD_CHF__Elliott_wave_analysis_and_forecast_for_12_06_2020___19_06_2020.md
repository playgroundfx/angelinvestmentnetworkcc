USD/CHF: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 12/06/2020 –
19/06/2020Alex Geuta

## [USD/CHF][1] remains likely to fall. Estimated pivot point is at a
level of 0.9532.

 **Main scenario:** consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 0.9532 with a target of 0.9323 – 0.9170.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
0.9532 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 0.9651 –
0.9781.

 **Analysis:** Supposedly, the third descending wave of larger degree
(3) continues developing on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame, with wave 1 of (3)
forming inside. On the 4-hour time frame, a correction finished
developing in the form of wave iv of 1 and wave v of 1 is forming, with
wave (iii) of v forming inside. Apparently, the third wave of smaller
degree iii of (iii) has formed on the H1 time frame.  If this assumption
is correct, the pair will continue to fall to 0.9323 – 0.9170 once
correction  iv of (iii) has formed. The level of 0.9532 is critical in
this scenario. Its breakout will allow the pair to continue rising to
the levels of 0.9651 – 0.9781.
