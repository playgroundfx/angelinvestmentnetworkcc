Economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the week 15.02.2021 – 21.02.2021Jana Kane

##  **Review of the main events of the Forex economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the
next trading week (15.02.2021 – 21.02.2021)**

 **Trading on key Forex [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/): next week we are expecting the publication
of important macro statistics from Australia, Eurozone, US, Germany,
Great Britain, and Canada.**

After an impressive growth in the first week of the month, last week the
American stock indices managed to increase their growth, if only
slightly. But the US dollar fell last week. The DXY dollar index lost 1%
and all the gains of the previous week.

Last Wednesday, the Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell signaled that
monetary stimulus would continue for a long time and hinted that
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) could be even softer than [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s expect. According to
him, the Fed in the near future is unlikely to "even think about
curtailing support" by raising rates or reducing bond purchases.

Stock indices continue to receive support from aggressive stimulus
policies from the Fed and the US government. At the same time, Powell's
comments confirm the opinion of the majority of financial market
participants that it is too early for a sustainable dollar recovery on
expectations of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) tightening, despite the growth in the US
government bond yields. Concerns about the US debt burden and the size
of the current account deficit of the balance of payments will also have
a negative impact on the dollar in the medium term, economists say.

Next week, China will continue to celebrate the Chinese New Year, and
therefore trading volumes during the Asian session in the first half of
next week will be reduced. The activity of traders on Monday will also
be affected by the celebration of the Presidents' Day in the United
States. American banks and stock exchanges will be closed on this day.

Nevertheless, next week financial market participants will pay attention
to the publication of important macro statistics from Australia,
Eurozone, US, Germany, Great Britain, and Canada.

 **Traders should pay attention to the publication of the following
macro indicators:**

 ***during the coming week, new events may be added to the [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) and
/ or some scheduled events may be canceled**

 ****GMT time**

###  **Monday, February 15**

Presidents' Day in the United States. American banks and exchanges are
closed, and the volume of trades on the financial market during the
American trading session will be insignificant. No important macro
statistics are scheduled to be released.

###  **Tuesday, February 16**

###  **00:30 AUD Minutes of the February meeting of the Reserve Bank of
Australia**

This document is published two weeks after the meeting and the decision
on the interest rate. If the RBA positively assesses the state of the
labor market in the country, the rate of GDP growth, and also shows a
hawkish attitude towards the inflationary forecast in the economy, the
markets regard this as a higher probability of a rate hike at the next
meeting, which is a positive factor for the AUD. The bank's mild
rhetoric regarding, above all, inflation puts pressure on the AUD.

At a meeting in early February, the central bank kept its key rate and
target yield on 3-year government bonds at 0.10%, but unexpectedly
announced an extension of its government bond purchase program, which
was due to end in April, signaling its intention to support the economy
emerging from recession. This decision put strong pressure on the
Australian dollar, although it subsequently recovered and re-entered the
levels of 3 years ago and approached the highs of March 2020.

The RBA Governor Philip Lowe said the economic recovery "is going well
and stronger than expected." Lowe previously said that "the economic
recovery will be uneven and unstable," and "unemployment may remain high
for a long time," promising that "the rate will not be raised until the
Central Bank sees progress in moving towards full employment and stable
inflation in the range of 2% -3% ”. According to RBA Governor Philip
Lowe, there are still "no serious arguments in favor of tightening
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) in the short term," and "some time will pass before
interest rates are raised."

Nevertheless, if the published minutes contain unexpected information
concerning the issues of the RBA's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), the volatility in
the AUD quotes will grow.

###  **10:00 EUR Eurozone GDP for the 4th quarter (second estimate)**

GDP is considered to be an indicator of the overall health of the
economy. A growing trend in GDP is considered positive for the EUR; a
low result weakens the EUR.

Recently, macro data from the Eurozone have been indicating a gradual
recovery in the growth rate of the European economy after a sharp drop
in early 2020. However, the decision made by the EU leaders in July to
provide additional economic support (a package of expenditures for the
economic recovery of the bloc of 1.8 trillion euros was approved) will
help stabilize the economy of the Eurozone. As a result of quarantine
restrictions, restraint in spending by companies and consumers, as well
as the collapse of exports the Eurozone is on the cusp of the deepest
economic downturn since World War II.

The euro reacted positively to this decision.

However, economists forecast that Eurozone GDP is expected to drop 0.7%
in Q4 2020 (down 5.1% on an annualized basis) after rising 12.5% ​​(down
4.3% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) in the 3rd quarter, falling by -11.8% (-14.7% in
annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) in the second quarter and falling by -3.6% (-3.1% in
annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) in the 1st quarter of 2020.

If the data turn out to be weaker than the preliminary estimate (-0.7%
and a decline of -5.1% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)), the euro may fall. Data better
than the first estimate may strengthen the euro in the short term,
although there is still a long way to a full recovery of the European
economy even to pre-crisis levels (quarterly growth within 0.2% - 0.4%).

###  **Wednesday, February 17**

###  **07:00 GBP Consumer Price Index. Core Consumer Price Index**

Consumer Price Index (CPI) reflects the dynamics of retail prices for a
group of goods and services that make up the British consumer basket.
CPI is a key indicator of inflation. Its publication causes active
movement of the pound in the foreign exchange market, as well as of the
FTSE100 index of the London stock exchange.

In the previous reporting month (December), the growth of consumer
inflation (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) amounted to +0.6%.

Forecast for January: +0.5% (annualized). This value is unlikely to
provide significant support to the pound. Indicator value below the
forecast could provoke a weakening of the pound, as low inflation will
force the Bank of England to adhere to a soft monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).

Core CPI is published by the Office for National Statistics and
determines the price change of a selected basket of goods and services
(excluding food and energy) for a given period. It is a key indicator
for assessing inflation and changes in purchasing preferences. A
positive result strengthens the GBP, a negative one weakens it.

In September, Core CPI (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) increased by +1.3%, in October
- by +1.5%, in December - by +1.4%. The publication of the indicator is
likely to have a positive effect on the pound if its value is higher
than the forecast and the previous value. Forecast for January: +1.3%
(annualized). The indicator reading below the forecast and previous
values ​​may provoke a weakening of the pound.

###  **13:30 USD Retail sales. Retail control group**

This report (Retail Sales) reflects the total sales of retailers of all
sizes and types. Changes in retail sales are the main indicator of
consumer spending. The report is a leading indicator, and in the future,
the data may be greatly revised. A high result strengthens the US
dollar, a low one weakens it. A relative decrease in the indicator may
have a short-term negative impact on the dollar, while an increase in
the indicator will have a positive effect on the USD. In the previous
month (December), the indicator decreased by -0.7%, which is
understandable against the background of the introduction of strict
quarantine restrictive measures in a number of states. Forecast for
January: +0.7%.

Retail sales is the leading indicator of consumer spending in the United
States showing changes in retail sales. The Retail Control Group metric
measures volume across the entire retail industry and is used to
calculate price indices for most products. A strong result strengthens
the US dollar, and vice versa, a weak report weakens the dollar. A
slight increase in indicators is unlikely to accelerate the growth of
the dollar. The data is worse than the values ​​of the previous period
(-1.9% in December, -0.5% in November, +0.1% in October, +0.9% in
September, -0.3% in August) may negatively affect dollar in the short
run. Forecast for January: +1.0%.

###  **13:30 CAD Consumer price indices in Canada**

Core Consumer Price Index (Core CPI) from the Bank of Canada reflects
the dynamics of the retail prices of the corresponding basket of goods
and services (excluding fruits, vegetables, gasoline, fuel oil, natural
gas, mortgage interest, intercity transportation, and tobacco products).
The inflation target for the Bank of Canada is in the range of 1% -3%.
The rise in CPI is a harbinger of a rate hike and a positive factor for
the CAD. Core Consumer Price Index increased in December 2020 by +0.7%,
in November by +1.5%, in October and September by +1.0% (in annual
[terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)). If the data for January turns out to be worse than the previous
values, it will negatively affect the CAD. The data better than the
previous values will strengthen the Canadian dollar.

###  **19:00 USD Minutes of the January meeting of the Federal Open
Market Committee ("FOMC minutes")**

The Fed usually releases the FOMC minutes two or three weeks after the
day the interest rate decision is made.

The publication of the minutes is extremely important for determining
the course of the current Fed [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) and the prospects for raising
interest rates in the United States. The volatility of trading in
financial markets during the publication of the minutes usually
increases, since the text often contains either changes or clarifying
details regarding the results of the last FOMC Fed meeting.

Recently, more and more often one can hear statements from the Fed
leaders indicating the Fed's inclination to continue the extra-soft
stimulating [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).

"Economic activity continued to recover, but the pace of improvement has
slowed," head of the Fed Jerome Powell said at a press conference after
a recent Fed meeting, urging the government to tighten its fiscal
stimulus.

The soft tone of the minutes will have a positive effect on stock
indices and negatively on the US dollar. The tough rhetoric of the Fed
leaders regarding the prospects for monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) will push the dollar
up.

It is possible that the minutes might contain some information regarding
the plans of action of the Fed leader at the meeting on March 16-17.

###  **Thursday, February 18 Февраля**

###  **00:30 AUD Employment rate. Unemployment rate**

The employment rate reflects the monthly change in the number of
Australian citizens employed. The growth of the indicator has a positive
impact on consumer spending, which stimulates economic growth. A high
value is positive for the AUD, while a low one is negative. Forecast: in
January, the number of employed Australian citizens increased by another
50,000 (after falling by 607,400 in April, by 264,100 in May and an
increase by 90,000 in November, 50,000 in December 2020).

Also at the same time, the Australian Bureau of Statistics will publish
a report on the unemployment rate - the indicator that assesses the
ratio of the unemployed population to the total number of able-bodied
citizens. The growth of the indicator indicates the weakness of the
labor market, which leads to a weakening of the national economy. The
decline in the indicator is a positive factor for the AUD. Forecast:
unemployment in Australia in January was at 6.5% (against 6.6% in
December, 6.8% in November, 7.0% in October, 6.9% in September, 6.8% in
August , 7.5% in July, 7.4% in June, 5.2% in March, 5.1% in February).
In general, the indicators are still not positive. However, in other
large economies, the labor market has deteriorated on an even larger
scale due to the coronavirus.

The leaders of the RBA have repeatedly stated that, in addition to the
situation in international trade, the Australian economy and the central
bank's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) plans are influenced by the indicators of the
level of household debt and expenditures, the growth of workers' wages,
as well as the state of the country's labor market.

In November 2020, the RB of Australia cut its key interest rate by
another 0.15%, to a new all-time low of 0.1%, due to the coronavirus. In
the opinion of the RBA management, an unemployment rate of 4.5% or lower
is required to raise wages and accelerate inflation to the target range.
Unemployment in the country is not declining, and a return of inflation
to the middle of the target range of 2-3% is not even in the distant
horizon.

The AUD is unlikely to react positively to the publication of data from
the country's labor market. If the values ​​of the indicators turn out
to be worse than forecast, then the Australian dollar may significantly
decline in the short term. Better-than-expected data will strengthen AUD
in the short term.

###  **12:30** **EUR Account of the ECB monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) meeting**

This document provides an overview of the current ECB [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) with
planned changes in the financial and monetary areas. The publication of
this document may cause a surge in volatility in trading in the euro and
in the European stock market.

Investors will carefully study the text of the minutes of the January
ECB meeting to pick up additional signals regarding the QE program and
the prospects for monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). Recently, weak macro data from the
Eurozone have been indicating a slowdown in the European economy, which,
against the background of international trade conflicts, puts pressure
on the ECB towards further easing of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).

Volatility in euro trading could rise sharply if the minutes contain
unexpected statements or new information regarding the outlook for
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).

###  **Friday, February 19**

###  **00:30** **AUD Retail Sales Index**

Retail Sales Index is published monthly by the Australian Bureau of
Statistics and measures total retail sales. The index is often
considered an indicator of consumer confidence and reflects the health
of the retail sector in the near term. Index growth is usually positive
for the AUD; a decrease in the indicator will negatively affect the AUD.
The previous value of the index (for December) was -4.1% after falling
by -17.7% in April. If the data for January turns out to be weaker than
the previous value, the AUD may sharply decline in the short term. If
the data turns out to be better than the previous values, the AUD is
likely to strengthen. Forecast: +2.0%.

###  **08:30 EUR Germany's Manufacturing PMI by Markit Economics
(preliminary release). Composite PMI by Markit Economics (preliminary
release)**

Germany's Manufacturing PMI is an important indicator of the business
environment and the overall health of the German economy. This sector of
the economy forms a significant part of Germany's GDP. A result above 50
is seen as positive and strengthens the EUR, one below 50 as negative
for the euro. Forecast for February (preliminary release): 56.5.

Previous values ​​of 57.1 in January, 58.3 in December 2020, 57.8 in
November, 58.2 in October against 34.5 in April, 45.4 in March, 48 in
February, 45.3 in January indicate the acceleration of business activity
in this sector of the German economy after its slowdown in early 2020.
The growth of the indicator above 50 and the previous value is likely to
support the euro (in the short term). The data worse than forecast and
especially below 50 ​​will have a negative impact on the euro.

Composite PMI is an important indicator of the business environment and
the overall health of the German economy. A result above 50 is
considered positive and strengthens the EUR, one below 50 - as negative
for the euro. Forecast for February (preliminary release): 50.3 against
50.8 in January, 52.0 in December 2020, 51.2 in November, 55 in October
against 17.4 in April, 35 in March, 50.7 in February, indicating that
the German economy is continuing to recover from its fall in early 2020,
albeit at a slower pace. The publication of this indicator with the
specified expected value is likely to support the euro. The data worse
than the forecast and below the value of 50.0, as a rule, have a
negative impact on the euro.

###  **09:00 EUR** **Composite Manufacturing PMI by Markit Economics
(preliminary release)**

The Eurozone Manufacturing PMI is an important indicator of the health
of the entire European economy. A result above 50 is considered positive
and strengthens the EUR, one below 50 - as negative for the euro.
Forecast for February (preliminary release): 48.1 against 47.8 in
January, 49.1 in December 2020, 45.3 in November, 50.0 in October
against 13.6 in April, 29.7 in March , 51.6 in February, 51.3 in
January, which is unlikely to have a positive effect on the euro even
despite the relative growth of the indicator. If the data turns out to
be worse than forecast, the euro may fall sharply in the short term.

###  **09:30 GBP UK Services PMI by Markit Economics (preliminary
release)**

The UK Services PMI is an important indicator of the health of the UK
economy. The service sector employs most of the UK's working-age
population and accounts for approximately 78% of GDP. Financial services
are still the most important part of the service industry. If the data
turns out to be worse than the forecast and the previous value, then the
pound is likely to drop sharply in the short term. The data better than
the forecast and the previous value will have a positive impact on the
pound. At the same time, the result above 50 is considered positive and
strengthens the GBP, below 50 - as negative for the GBP.

Previous values ​​of the indicator: 39.5 in January, 49.4 in December
2020, 47.6 in November, 51.4 in October, after falling to 29.0 in May,
13.4 in April, 34.5 in March. Preliminary forecast for February: 40.5.

###  **13:30 CAD Retail Sales Index**

Retail Sales Index is published monthly by Statistics Canada and
estimates total retail sales. The index is often considered an indicator
of consumer confidence and reflects the health of the retail sector in
the near term. A rise in the index is usually positive for the CAD; a
decrease in the indicator will negatively affect the CAD. The previous
value of the index (for November) +1.3% after falling in March by -9.9%,
in April - by -25% and growth in May by +18.7% in 2020. If the data for
December turns out to be weaker than the forecast, the CAD may decline
in the short term. Forecast: +0.1%.
