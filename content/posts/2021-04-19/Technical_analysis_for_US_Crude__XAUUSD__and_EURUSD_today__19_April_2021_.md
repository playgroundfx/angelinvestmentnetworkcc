Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 19.04.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

Last week, gold price reached Target Zone 2 1782 - 1777.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

The short-term oil trend is up. From Friday to Monday, oil corrected to
the trend key support 62.86. The level is being held by traders. Look
for a buy pattern and buy oil with a target at 63.81.

If during today's trading session the level of 62.86 is broken out and
the price consolidates below, then it will be possible to consider
selling with a target in the Intermediary Zone 61.37 - 61.11.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

  1. Buy according to the pattern in the level of 62.86. TakeProfit: 63.81. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. Sell when level 62.86 is broken out. TakeProfit: Intermediary Zone 61.37 - 61.11. StopLoss: 63.28.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

Last week, gold price reached Target Zone 2 1782 - 1777. Further growth
is questionable. For new purchases, break out Target Zone 2 and
consolidate the price above. In this case, the next target will be Gold
Zone 2 1805 - 1802.

Today, it is reasonable to enter long trades on correction at strong
supports: Additional Zone 1771 - 1770 and Intermediary Zone 1758 - 1756.
The target is Friday's high.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

  1. Buy according to the pattern in Additional Zone 1771 - 1770. TakeProfit: 1782. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. Buy according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 1758 - 1756. TakeProfit: 1782. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

Last Friday, the euro Thursday's high was updated. After that, the
correction began. As part of the correction today, the short-term
uptrend's key support 1.1950 was tested.

A “false breakout” pattern was formed around level 1.1950, so the price
returned to the support Additional Zone 1.1954 - 1.1950. Now the price
has already reached the resistance level of 1.1986. It serves as a
target for taking profits.

Further euro growth will be possible if the resistance level of 1.1988
is broken out. The target will be Target Zone 2 1.2040 - 1.2024.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

  1. Open buy positions above level 1.1988. TakeProfit: Target Zone 2 1.2040 - 1.2024. StopLoss: 1.1975.

  2. Open sell positions below level 1.1944. TakeProfit: Intermediary Zone 1.1914 - 1.1906. StopLoss: 1.1961.
