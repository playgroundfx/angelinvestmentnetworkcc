Will the EURUSD rally continue? Forecast as of 19.04.2021Dmitri
Demidenko

The decline in the Treasury yields and the [S&P 500][1] rally create a
favorable foreign environment for the [EURUSD][2]. However, the uptrend
will hardly be steady without positive [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) from Europe. Let us discuss
the Forex outlook and make up a trading plan.

## Weekly euro fundamental forecast

Christine Lagarde compared the euro area with a patient walking out of
intensive care with the support of two crutches. However, many patients
recover much faster than doctors expect them to. The vaccination speed
in Europe is increasing, and there were more than 100 million doses
injected in the week ended April 16. So, the [EURUSD][2] bulls can well
go ahead. Good [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) from Europe will support the euro rally.

Expectations of the ECB dovish rhetoric and weak forecasts for the euro-
area PMI in April set back the euro bulls. Although Klaas Knot, the
Dutch Central Bank president, calls for the reduction of asset purchases
under the PEPP already in the third quarter, the majority of the
Governing Council members are likely to avoid the grandstanding. At its
previous monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) meeting in March, the ECB decided to increase
the bond purchase pace. Since then, adjusting for the Easter holidays,
the central bank has bought €19 billion of bonds a week, compared with a
weekly average of €15 billion earlier in the year. The ECB doves may
want more looking at the growth of the European bond yields, however,
such actions can be based on both right and wrong reasons. On the one
hand, it is suggested by the euro-area economic recovery. On the other
hand, the rally of the European bond yields results from the outer
reasons.

The divergence in the growth on government bond yields has been the key
driver of the [EURUSD][2] strengthening in mid-April. Furthermore,
positive [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) from Europe could support the euro rally. Based on the
economic surprise index, the euro now looks a bit undervalued against
the US dollar.

### Dynamics of [EURUSD][2] and economic surprise index

In March, many US economic reports were disappointing, which allowed
divergences to appear in the chart. At the same time, the modest
forecasts for the euro area allow us to expect that their exceeding the
actual data will encourage the [EURUSD][2] bulls to go ahead.

Now, the [EURUSD][2] buyers are discouraged by the euro's inability to
strengthen against a favorable background. The Treasury yields are going
down, the stock indexes hit new all-time highs, pressing down the
greenback. Investors wonder what if the [S&P 500][1] starts a
correction. In fact, [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) proves that the stock market rallied 14 out
of the last 15 times in a year when 90% of the companies in its
calculation base traded above the 50-day moving average, which is still
the case at present.

### Weekly [EURUSD][2] trading plan

There will hardly be a deep correction of the US stock indexes.
Consumers, according to research by Moody's, have accumulated $ 5.4
trillion in extra savings, and most of this comes from the USA. A
favorable foreign environment and the expectations of positive [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) from
the euro area will allow entering the [EURUSD][2] long positions on the
correction towards 1.193 and 1.188. It is still relevant to buy the euro
on the breakout of the resistance at $1.199.
