Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 19.04.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

Bitcoin and Ethereum started forming double zigzags; Ripple is forming a
standard zigzag (A)-(B)-(C).

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

The BTCUSD market must have completed the impulse wave (A). Its final
leg is an ending diagonal. There is forming the initial part of the
bearish double zigzag. The first sub-wave W may have finished as a
triple zigzag [W]-[X]-[Y]-[X]-[Z]. In the near future, there should be
forming the upward linking wave X. The X wave should end at a level of
61200.00, where wave X will be 76.4% of wave W.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 57050.50, TP 61200.00

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

The price has recently finished rising in the impulse wave [1]. Next,
the market has started forming the bearish simple zigzag (A)-(B)-(C).
The down wave (A) may have finished as a leading diagonal; there is now
forming the upward corrective wave (B). The (B) correction should end at
a level of 1.770, where it will be 76.4% of wave (A). One could enter a
buy position in the current situation.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] today:

Buy 1.523, TP 1.770

## Elliott wave Ethereum analysis

The market must have finished the large zigzag. The most recent chart
section displays the upward impulse wave C, which looks complete. There
is now developing the downward double zigzag (W)-(X)-(Y). The first
downward zigzag-shaped wave (W) has completed so far. Over the next few
days, the price could be going up in the linking wave (X) to a level of
2400.00. At this level, wave (X) will be 76.4% of (W).

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Buy 2264.21, TP 2400.00
