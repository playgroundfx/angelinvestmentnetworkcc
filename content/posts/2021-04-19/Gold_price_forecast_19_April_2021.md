Conditions look favorable for gold. Forecast as of 19.04.2021Dmitri
Demidenko

Unlike the oil market, where prices are based on supply and demand for a
physical asset, the gold price is determined by other factors. Let us
analyze the gold outlook and make up a trading plan

## Monthly gold fundamental forecast

Banks and investment companies are trying to find reasons for the
soaring gold price by analyzing the rise in Indian imports to a 2-year
high of 98.6 tons, strong demand for physical assets in China, and even
the collapse of Bitcoin after the launch of Coinbase. At the same time,
technical analysts associate the precious metal's rise with prices
exceeding the 50-day moving average. It's obvious to me that the
weakening US dollar and falling Treasury yields have created favorable
conditions for the [XAUUSD][1] bulls. If the situation with the
greenback is more or less clear, then the drop in the rates of the US
bond market to monthly lows has yet to be dealt with.

### Dynamics of gold, US dollar and bond yields

Gold bears claim that the price of the precious metal is growing not due
to, but despite the expected boom in global economic growth. The bears
sincerely hope that the [XAUUSD][1] rally will not continue without the
reversal of the specialized exchange-traded funds' downtrend. Indeed,
from November to March, the indicator decreased by 9% in physical [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/).
In March alone, [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/) investments fell by 108 tons, which is equivalent to
$6 billion.

In my opinion, physical gold prices follow the [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/) trend, not vice
versa. In March, the bond market tested the Fed's ability to be true to
the principle of non-interference. Treasury yields were growing rapidly,
which contributed not only to the US dollar strengthening but also to
the fall of precious metals prices. In this regard, neither Beijing's
permission for Chinese commercial banks to import gold to meet growing
demand nor the rising premiums in Shanghai and London, matters as much
as the collapse in US debt rates and the greenback fall.

The sharp decline of the Bitcoin price after the launch of Coinbase
affects the stocks of specialized exchange-traded funds rather than the
[XAUUSD][1] price. We must admit that part of the capital flowing from
[ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/)s has been deposited in crypto-funds. The question immediately
arises, what comes first, the prices for the gold assets or the physical
gold prices?

### Dynamics of gold and [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) funds reserves

 _Source: Bloomberg._

The USD index is losing ground for two reasons. First, the good [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/)
about the bright future of the US economy has already largely worked
out. Second, the eurozone economy is starting to recover. The reason for
the decline in Treasury bond yields, lies in the growing demand for them
from foreign [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s, primarily from Japan, as well as in the market's
belief in the Fed.

The Federal Reserve believes that the surge in inflation will be
temporary. Then again there will be deflationary pressures, which many
central banks are simply unable to cope with. If so, then the rise in
Treasury yields should also be seen as a pullback within a long-term
downtrend. This fact, combined with the USD index's bearish sentiment,
creates favorable conditions for the [XAUUSD][1] bulls.

### Monthly gold trading plan

I recommend holding and adding up to the long trades entered on the
corrections following the breakout of the resistance [at $1,750 per
ounce][2].
