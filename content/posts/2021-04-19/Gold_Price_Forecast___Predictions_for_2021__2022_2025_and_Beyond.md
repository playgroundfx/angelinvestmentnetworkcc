Gold Price Forecast & Prediction: 2021 and BeyondJana Kane

After falling below $1200 per ounce in 2018, gold rebounded sharply over
the next 12 months, and a significant bullish trend began. Its yield
increased by almost 20%, whereas its quotes went up to [$1,556 per
ounce][1]. The rally continued in 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic increased
the popularity of the precious metal as a hedging instrument, which has
led to an increase in its price. In this article, we'll look into
[historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) data, see what experts have to say, and make a gold price
forecast and prediction for 2021 and some years ahead.

The article covers the following subjects:

## A Recent History of Gold

Western [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s' interest in gold led to an increase in its rate from
a minimum of $1160 in the summer of 2018 to a record high of [almost
$2073][2] in August of this year. During this time, the precious metal
has become one of the most attractive financial assets on the planet.
This year, the economic fallout from the pandemic and negative bond
yields have driven a record $60 billion in gold [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/) capital growth. This
is twice as much as in 2009, at the height of the financial crisis.

The pandemic has convinced [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s that gold should be part of their
portfolios. The precious metal has become a leading hedge against
volatility in equity markets and negative interest rates. Gold turned
out to be one of the most attractive assets in 2020.

Large [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s bought gold for protection against possible deflation in
some countries, which could be the result of slowing economic growth and
rising inflation in other countries as governments continue to pump
liquidity into the economy. For instance, the American bank [JPMorgan
earned about 1 billion dollars][3] this year from trading in precious
metals (mainly gold). According to the consulting company Coalition,
this year, revenue from trading in precious metals from the 50 largest
investment banks will double and reach a nine-year high of $2.5 billion.

Even Warren Buffett changed his mind about gold. Previously, he
considered precious metals a useless asset. This year, his Berkshire
Hathaway Inc. [acquired][4] 20.9 million shares of one of the world's
largest gold mining companies - Barrick Gold Corp. (Canada).

However, demand in the main gold consuming countries, India and China,
has not been up to par this year. People sold their savings in gold or
pledged them when the precious metal rose to a record high in local
currencies. The high cost of the precious yellow metal and the economic
turmoil caused by the pandemic have crippled consumer demand. Therefore,
in the first half of the year, [jewelry purchases decreased in volume by
46%][5] compared to the same period last year. The reason is quarantine
and a decrease in the income of the population.

Investors will continue to fill the gap in demand. This year, exchange-
traded funds will accumulate 1205 tons of precious metal in their
reserves, three times more than in 2019. The figure may reach 1,362 tons
next year.

Central banks have been buying precious metals quarterly since early
2011. In the third quarter of this year, they became net sellers,
reducing reserves by 12.1 tons. Nonetheless, CBRs remain net buyers
annually as demand for the first three quarters was 220.6 tons. In all
likelihood, they will maintain this status in 2020, although the volume
of purchases will be less than in the previous two years. Russia has
suspended purchases, and China has not reported an increase in reserves
since September 2019.

## Gold Price Today

The yellow metal rose 17% in the first half of 2020 and another 10% in
July, and it reached a record high of $2073 per ounce on August 6. Since
then, an ounce of gold has dropped to $1,844 amid [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) of a coronavirus
vaccine. However, the euphoria about the vaccine is premature. The
pandemic is not leaving the agenda. Nevertheless, this year's yield on
the precious metal was in the range of 16-30%. Note that many forecasts
for 2020 assumed the growth of precious metal quotations to $1600-1700
per ounce in the event of increased geopolitical and economic
instability.Â The current price of gold is $1 771.29.



## What Do Experts Predict?

Analysts expect prices to rise. Many world-famous investment houses and
banks are waiting for the resumption of growth in gold's value this year
and the continuation of the upward trend next. [Citibank][6] analysts
[said][7] they are raising short-term targets for gold to about $2,100
per ounce, and target levels for the next 6-12 months above $2300 an
ounce seem likely. According to Citibank, record [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/) inflows, a
weakening US currency, and negative real returns are the main factors
driving further price increases.

Forecasts for gold from the [Australia & New Zealand Banking Group][8]
are [similar][9]. According to their analysts, the decline in prices
since August 7 is only a short-term correction before rising to about
$2300 next year. The bank experts call the same drivers of the XAU price
rise. Plus, they are still waiting for the growth in demand for physical
gold.

[Saxo Bank][10][is waiting][11] for the $2000 level by the end of this
year. Metals Focus also agrees with them. Many more opinions from
reputable investment bankers and quotes from well-known analysts can be
cited, but this will not change the overall picture: the vast majority
of them predict a rise in the gold price. Such a consensus will
certainly stimulate the flow of funds from [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s in gold assets,
contributing to an increase in the price of this precious metal.

## Gold Price Prediction for 2021

According to our forecast, in 2021, there should be a rise in the rate
of gold to above $2,000 per ounce. The following factors will facilitate
this:

  1. The increase in inflationary expectations and the weakening of the US currency will result from generous fiscal and monetary stimulus.

  2. An increase in investment demand and a gradual recovery in consumer demand in China and India will support the precious metal rate at a high level.

  3. Government bonds (government debt) will not play the role of defensive assets in the face of inflation and negative interest rates since they will cease to generate income.

At the same time, the opportunity cost of owning gold decreases. This
will increase the popularity of the precious metal in the eyes of
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s in 2021.

All Western countries are experiencing unprecedented growth in the money
supply. From the beginning of February to the end of October, the
aggregate volume of money supply in the United States increased from
$15.4 billion to $18.8 billion, an increase of 22%. In the United
States, the Eurozone, the United Kingdom, and Japan, the figure rose
15.7% from February to September 2020. Consequently, the risk of higher
inflation in 2021 is very high.

As the purchasing power of the leading currencies decreases, gold tends
to rise. The precious yellow metal is an inflation hedging instrument.

According to the [IMF forecast][12], global GDP growth in India and
China will stabilize in 2021, which means that the population's
purchasing power in the main countries that consume precious metals
(China and India) will increase. Signs of a recovery in consumer demand
in these countries emerge at the end of 2020. Thus, in October, jewelry
sales in China increased by 17% year on year. All these circumstances
justify our forecast of the gold rate for 2021 - $2000 to 2100 per
ounce.

## Gold Technical Analysis

[XAU/USD][13] technical analysis: big time frames.

 ****

First, define global trends in the gold market. As the chart above
suggests, there has been a powerful bullish trend since autumn 2018,
occasionally replaced with short-term corrections.

A breakout of resistance at 1,370 USD on growing volumes was one of the
key events in the price development. Now, that level serves as a strong
support level.

Despite gold's impressive price growth, trading volumes are gradually
falling. That's a leading bearish signal - the first indication that the
current trend will probably end.

Sellers' another call was the Doji candle formed at a [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) peak of
2,075 USD in August. That level is now a severe obstacle for the buyer.

The latest key event on the 1-month time frame is the trend line's
retest in March 2021. It's another signal of a bearish reversal.

### Gold price prediction for next three months

 ****

To make a 3-month gold forecast, look at the weekly time frame. The
chart above shows a hidden bullish divergence between the [MACD indicator](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/macd.html)
and the price chart. RSI is near the oversold territory's limits.

Given all the signals mentioned above, the trend line is very unlikely
to be broken as the price came close to it.

Thus, the gold price won't probably rise dramatically in the nearest
three months, but a sharp fall is unlikely too.

The [Bollinger Bands](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/bollinger-bands.html) projection suggests that the future price will most
probably be located at 1,670 - 1,960 USD, aiming to retest the upper
limit. I can't exclude price movements beyond that area, but the
[historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) high of 2,075 USD is unlikely to be updated considering
projected growth.

### What will be the price of gold in 2021?

 ****

To make a realistic long-term forecast for the [XAUUSD][13], let's
analyze the past years' price [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/).

Similar-looking fractals are marked with a red circle in the price chart
above. The 2011-2012 scenarios are very likely to repeat themselves.
Back then, the trend reversed through a double top formation.

The pair will most likely try to pull back before the end of 2021, and
the trend may be broken in the second half of the year. The support
level at 1.370 US dollars mentioned earlier limits the fall.

Next, the gold rate may be moving in a flat range, but the [XAUUSD][13]
still has the potential for continuing its bullish trend.

 ****

Based on the above scenario and using [Bollinger Bands](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/bollinger-bands.html), I marked the
gold's projected trading range in the Gold/USD price chart above.

The table below provides the gold rateâs minimum and maximum expected
values for each month.

*Please note that long-term price forecasts for any investment asset are very approximate and may change due to various factors. Keep reading to find out which factors may [affect the price of gold][17].

## How Has the Price of Gold Changed Over Time?

Below is a chart that shows how the price of gold changed over the past
ten years. In order to make our predictions and forecasts as accurate as
possible, itâs important to look back to such [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) data.

 _Source: Goldprice.org, the screenshot was taken on December 20, 2020_

## Factors That May Affect the Price of Gold

Typically, traders associate fundamental analysis with the stock market,
not gold. While fundamental stock market analysts monitor certain
companies' financial statements, gold market analysts monitor
macroeconomic factors, political and economic world stability, and
competition from investment alternatives to forecast prices. Let's look
into five macroeconomic parameters that can influence the cost of the
main precious metal.

### 1\. Inflation

Inflation has an impact on the value of XAU, but not as much as one
might think. Most novice gold [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s believe that if inflation rises
in the US, then gold price should also go up since more inflation
dollars will have to be paid per ounce. However, in the long term, there
is no strong correlation between inflation and gold prices. This can be
seen from the chart below, which shows the inflation dynamics in the US
and gold prices.

 _Source: Tradingview.com_

This lack of a strong correlation can be explained by two reasons:

a) Gold is not a commodity. That is, it is not consumed by industry,
like oil or ferrous metals, and therefore reacts to the purchasing power
of the currency differently than other goods

b) During periods of economic and stock market growth, gold has to
âcompeteâ for profitability and [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) attention. Moreover, during
such periods, inflation is usually at a high level.

### 2\. Currency Fluctuations

Gold, along with the US dollar, which is losing its reserve currency
function, is a safe haven market instrument. Therefore, if the exchange
rate of one of the currencies (for example, the dollar) depreciates
relative to the other reserve currencies, while the purchasing power of
buying gold in other currencies is preserved, then the logical
consequence is the rise in the price of gold relative to the depreciated
currency. The chart shows an inverse long-term relationship between the
US dollar index (white line) and the dynamics of gold prices (yellow
line).

### 3\. The Risk of a Recession Due to War

War or the threat of war is the most significant (after financial market
crises) source of uncertainty for [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s. Gold is best used as a safe
investment in times when [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are terrified, and war may well cause
such conditions in the market. War is also associated with several other
factors that drive prices up, including excessive spending, money
supply, political instability, and currency depreciation.

### 4\. Interest Rates

Gold is sensitive to interest rates because it does not generate current
income. Therefore, it is highly sensitive to alternatives in the stock
market that offer potential income, such as bonds or even stocks that
pay dividends. There is a noticeable, albeit not perfect, negative
correlation. When US government bond yields rise, the likelihood is high
that gold will trend sideways or even downtrend, while declining yields
tend to lead to very positive movements in gold prices.

For example, to combat the recession in the early 2000s, the Fed lowered
interest rates to very low levels, forcing long-term [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s to
withdraw from low-yield bonds and diversify their portfolios with gold.
This provided good support to the already rising gold prices.

### 5\. Supply and Demand

Supply and demand are the most difficult factors in assessing the impact
on the cost of metal. Large [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s in gold, including central banks,
the IMF, and leading funds, significantly impact the market. The actions
of these participants can substantially change the demand for gold
jewellery and investment instruments.

Accounting for the actions of these large players is an impossible task
for an ordinary private [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) who does not have access to the
disclosed information of all the players' data.

For a general understanding of the market balance, you need to know that
most of the demand for gold is more or less evenly distributed between
investment instruments and jewelry.

As an example, it is shown below that China and India (with strong
economic growth) have become major buyers of gold over the past two
decades to invest and create reserves and, therefore, have provided an
additional stimulus for price increases.

## Conclusion: Is Gold a Good Investment?

Gold has proven to be an excellent defensive asset in 2020. Against the
backdrop of the coronavirus crisis and recessions in key countries of
the world in 2020, gold quotes have reached [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) highs. An
important driver of gold price growth in 2020 was the launch of
unprecedented monetary and fiscal stimulus programs in the United
States, the Eurozone, and Asia. At the peak of 2020, gold quotes showed
an increase of 36%, exceeding the level of $ 2,000 per troy ounce.

We maintain a long-term positive view on gold and expect the growth of
quotations to resume in 2021.

As new initiatives of the world's central banks and governments to
support markets and economies are implemented in 2021, gold quotes will
resume their growth. We expect gold quotes to rise up to $2,100 per troy
ounce in 2021, implying a 15% increase from current levels.
