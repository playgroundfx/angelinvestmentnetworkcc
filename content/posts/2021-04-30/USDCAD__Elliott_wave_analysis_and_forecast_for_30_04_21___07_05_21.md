USDCAD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 30.04.21 – 07.05.21Alex
Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 1.2652 with a target of 1.2150 – 1.2000.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
1.2652 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 1.2857 –
1.2989.

 **Analysis:** wave (С) of 4 of larger degree continues developing on
the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame, with the third wave 3 of (C) forming inside. The
fifth wave v of 3 is forming on the H4 time frame, with wave (v) of v of
smaller degree developing inside. Apparently, the third wave iii of (v)
is developing on the H1 time frame. If this assumption is correct, the
pair will continue to fall to 1.2150 – 1.2000. The level of 1.2652 is
critical in this scenario, as the breakout will enable the pair to
continue rising to the levels of 1.2857 – 1.2989.
