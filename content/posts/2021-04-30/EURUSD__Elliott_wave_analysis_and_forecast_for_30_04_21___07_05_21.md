EURUSD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 30.04.21 – 07.05.21Alex
Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 1.2342 with a target of 1.1600 – 1.1489 once a correction is
completed.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
1.2342 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 1.2500 –
1.2600.

 **Analysis:** Daily time frame: presumably, the first wave of larger
degree 1 of (3) formed, and a downside correction is forming as wave 2
of (3). Apparently, wave a of 2 formed and ascending wave b of 2 is
developing on the H4 time frame. Supposedly, wave of smaller degree (a)
of b formed on the H1 time frame. If this assumption is correct, the
pair may be expected to continue falling to the levels of 1.1600 –
1.1489 once wave (b) of 2 is completed. The level of 1.2342 is critical
in this scenario. Its breakout will allow the pair to continue rising to
the levels of 1.2500 – 1.2600.
