Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 30.04.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

The euro price is being corrected down in the short-term uptrend.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

The oil price is going up. Yesterday, the price closed above level
64.30. The next target within a short-term uptrend is the Target Zone
66.20 - 65.69.

Correction started from yesterday's high. The key price zones from which
it is profitable to enter new oil purchases are Additional Zone 64.11 -
63.98 and Intermediary Zone 62.83 - 62.58.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

Buy in the zone of 64.30 - 63.54. TakeProfit: Target Zone 66.20 - 65.69.
StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

Yesterday, the short-term gold trend reversed down. The idea of
purchasing precious metal didn't prove to be correct. From today, it is
profitable to look for gold sales with the target at level 1757.

During the second half of yesterday, a correction in a new trend has
been developing. As part of this correction, the price entered the zone
of good sell prices: 1770 - 1783. Today, wait for a sell pattern and
enter gold sales with the target outlined above.

To reverse the trend up, traders need to break out the Intermediary Zone
1783 - 1781 and consolidate the price higher.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

Open sell positions according to the pattern in 1770 - 1783. TakeProfit:
1757. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

The euro price is being corrected down in the short-term uptrend. Now
the traders are testing the Additional Zone 1.2106 - 1.2101. Holding the
zone and forming a buy pattern will lead to a price rise to the zone
around level 1.2146.

Breakout of the Additional Zone will lead to the development of a deeper
correction with the target in the Intermediary Zone 1.2062 - 1.2053.

Today, it is profitable to look for purchases according to the pattern
at the support zones indicated above. There will be an opportunity to
start selling after the breakout of level 1.2106.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

  1. Buy according to the pattern in Additional Zone 1.2106 - 1.2101. TakeProfit: 1.2146. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. Sell when level 1.2106 is broken out. TakeProfit: 1.2058. StopLoss: 1.2129.
