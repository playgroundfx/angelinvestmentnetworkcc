If the US continues its tactics, the greenback may repeat the post-war
sterling's fate

## Joe Biden has outrun his predecessor so far

Donald Trump once was sure that stock indexes' dynamics reflected his
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)'s efficiency, so he eyed them. The [S&P 500][1]'s growth would
show the Americans' confidence in their president better than anything
else. In that context, Joe Biden outperformed his predecessor. In the
first 100 days of the Democrat's presidency, the [S&P 500][1] grew 11%,
while the Republican could boast just 5.3%. However, any impressions
depend on when and where. If you see a bear in the circus, you'll laugh.
If you see a bear in the forest, you'll soil your pants.

In contrast to Trump, who attempted to boost the economy by cutting
taxes, Biden opted for massive fiscal stimuli. Both presidents
experimented, but the pandemic ruined the Republican, and the current
president's performance is yet to be assessed. Both presidents found
enemies to combat. Those were China and Jerome Powell for Trump and
Russia for Biden.

According to research by Queen's University Centre for Economic History
in Belfast, the greenback may follow the pound's fate if the US
continues to use it as a geostrategic weapon. Before World War II, the
pound served as the main reserve currency. Back then, the UK used its
issuer status to impose various restrictions that eventually led to the
sterling area's collapse. These days, it's the US that introduces
sanctions, and US sanctioned countries give up the greenback. In Q4, the
USD's share in Russian exports dropped below 50% for the first time in
[history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/). The euro's share grew by ten base points to 36%, on the
contrary.

Times change. When girls have butterflies in the stomach that call for
love, women have moths that call for a new fur coat. One cannot compare
the current situation with the post-war one, but both presidents'
strategy - "I do bad things, but I do them well" - bothers other
countries. In 2019, Europe, concerned about Trump's trading wars, was
ready to promote the euro’s role in the global trade. China had had that
plan for the yuan for a long time already.

Could the US dollar weaken in April because some countries abandoned it
due to sanctions and other related threats? The greenback has closed in
the red zone for four straight weeks, the longest losing streak since
July. However, in April, we learnt that the employment rate had grown by
almost 1 million, GDP expanded 6.4%, inflation accelerated to 2.6%, and
personal consumption had been the second-fastest since the 1960s. Joe
Biden asserts America is ready to take off, but its currency is getting
to the bottom. I can't say that the 46th US president is worried about
that. His predecessor would often say a strong dollar harmed the
economy, only making it stronger on tension. The Democrat chose another
strategy.
