XAUUSD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 30.04.21 – 07.05.21Alex
Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions from corrections above the
level of 1751.35 with a target of 1817.95 – 1851.32.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
1751.35 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of
1722.72 – 1675.55.

 **Analysis:** an ascending third wave of larger degree (3) formed on
the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame, and a descending correction developed as wave (4),
supposedly. H4 time frame: apparently, the fifth wave (5) started
forming, with the first wave of smaller degree 1 of (5) forming inside.
Apparently, the third wave iii of 1 finished forming, and a corrective
wave iv of 1 of (5) is nearing completion on the H1 time frame. If the
presumption is correct, the pair will continue to rise to the levels of
1817.95 – 1851.32 once the correction is over. The level of 1751.35 is
critical in this scenario as its breakout will enable the pair to
continue declining to the levels of 1722.72 – 1675.55.
