Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 09.11.2020Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I suggest entry signals
to trade each cryptocurrency.

Ripple and Ethereum are forming the final legs of the bullish impulse
trends. Ripple is forming the final impulse within the upwards
corrective wave.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

 ****

Bitcoin continues forming the upward impulse wave C that is composed of
five sub-waves [1]-[2]-[3]-[4]-[5]. The corrective wave [4] has recently
completed as a double zigzag (w)-(x)-(y). There is now forming a bullish
impulse [5]. The first four elements of wave [5] should have completed,
so the price should be rising in wave (5) towards level 16700.00.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 15427.00, TP 16700.00

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

 ****

The XRPUSD market is forming the corrective wave (B) that is an element
of the bearish zigzag of a larger degree. The (B) correction is
unfolding as a simple zigzag A-B-C, where A is a bullish five-wave
impulse, B is a correction completed as a bearish triple zigzag. Wave C
is also is an impulse, with the final leg unfolding inside. The market
should be rising to a level of 0.272 in the impulse wave [5], where the
entire correction (B) will be 50% of the (A) impulse, according to
Fibonacci retracements.

### Trading plan for **[XRPUSD][2]** today:

Buy 0.252, TP 0.272

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

 ****

The ETHUSD market is unfolding the bullish impulse composed of five sub-
waves [1]-[2]-[3]-[4]-[5]. The corrective wave [4] has recently
completed as a triple zigzag. Next, the sub-waves (1)-(2)-(3)-(4) have
ended within the bullish impulse [5]. Wave (5) should soon conclude
impulse [5]. Therefore, the price should be rising in wave (5) to a
level of 507.00.

### Trading plan for  **[ETHUSD][3] **today:

Buy 450.42, TP 507.00
