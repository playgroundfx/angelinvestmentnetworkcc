Dollar is set back by euphoria. Forecast as of 09.11.2020Dmitri
Demidenko

Investors continue trading the idea of Joe Biden becoming the president.
That is why the [S&P 500][1] features the best weekly rise since April
and pushes the EURUSD up. How long will it continue? Let us discuss the
Forex outlook and make up a [EURUSD][2] trading plan.

##  **Weekly US dollar fundamental analysis**

Euphoria rules the market. Investors forgot about both COVID-19, the US
fiscal stimulus's unsettled issue, and Donald Trump rejecting the voting
results. Traders are satisfied with the less uncertainty around Joe
Biden’s [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), hoping for lower volatility. Analysts suggest that the
divided Congress won’t allow Biden to carry out radical reforms in
tightening taxation and [regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/) of technology companies. As a result,
the [S&P 500][1] grew by 7.3% in the first week of November, and the USD
dropped to the lowest level since early September.

How long will the euphoria last? History proves that starting from 2000,
if the [S&P 500][1] was growing on election day, it continued growing in
November and December. The first years of presidential [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) were also
favorable for the US stock indexes. The [S&P 500][1] grew by 18.6% on
average. However, the stock indexes’ trends during the time of the
divided Congress, which prevented the White House from carrying out
radical reforms, were controversial. During 45 years, starting from
1928, when one party controlled the US government, the stock market rose
at an average rate of 7.46% annually, up from 7.26% in 46 years when the
power was divided.

###  **Reaction of[S&P 500][1] to the political situation in USA **

In my opinion, the markets are going too fast. Investors want to join
the stock market’s uptrend, forgetting about the negative. However, are
some negative factors that should have their effect. First, political
uncertainty continues. Donald Trump is challenging the election results.
Because of the second round of voting in Georgia, we will know the
partisan makeup of the U.S. Senate only on January 5. It creates
obstacles to the agreement on the new fiscal stimulus. Until a fresh
stimulus is provided, the US economy will be slowing down, which presses
down both the global GDP and the risk appetite.

Second, the coronavirus vaccines haven’t yet been developed, and the
COVID-19 pandemic continues in the USA and in the euro area. The numbers
of new coronavirus cases, hospitalizations, and deaths are hitting all-
time highs, so [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s’ optimism is surprising. The epidemiological
situation in Europe is deteriorating. France, Germany, and other
countries are locked down. This fact suggests that the divergence in the
economic growth and monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) is in favor of the [EURUSD][2]
bears.

Finally, the U.S. dollar may not be falling amid the growth of the [S&P
500][1]. The negative correlation between stocks and the USD is the
strongest at the time of uncertainty, also because of the US
presidential election. Once uncertainty eases, the negative correlation
should stop working.

###  **Weekly[EURUSD][2] trading plan**

Euphoria rules the market, but it can’t last for long. If the
[EURUSD][2] bulls fail to hold the price above 1.188, the pair should
roll down to 1.183 and 1.1785. Otherwise, if the resistance is held up,
the euro could continue the rally up to $1.195-$1.196 and even $1.2.
Next, large traders should take some profits and exit the longs.
