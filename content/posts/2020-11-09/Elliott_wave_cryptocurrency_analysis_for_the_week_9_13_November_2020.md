Medium-term forecast for five cryptocurrencies as of 09.11.2020Roman
Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a medium-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, EOS, and Ripple. I offer
trading signals for each cryptocurrency pair.

All major cryptocurrency pairs are forming the final legs of upward
trends. In the medium-term outlook, [cryptocurrency price](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/cryptocurrency-price/)s should be
rising, so, one could enter purchases.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

 ****

Since late November 2017, the BTCUSD market has been forming the
corrective wave 4 as a double zigzag. The descending wave [W] finished
as a simple zigzag. Next, there has started forming the upward linking
wave [X] as a double zigzag, where the sub-waves (W) and (X) have
completed; wave (Y) is yet unfolding. Let us study the most recent part
of the price chart in the eight-hour timeframe.

Wave (Y) is forming as a simple zigzag A-B-C. The corrective wave B has
completed as a contracting triangle. The market has resumed rising in
the bullish impulse wave C that is composed of five sub-waves
[1]-[2]-[3]-[4]-[5]. The price should be rising in the impulse wave [5]
to a level of 16700.00, where impulse C will be 76.4% of impulse A.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] for the week:

Buy 15427.00, TP 16700.00

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

 ****

Ethereum continues forming the uptrend. It is clear from the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) chart
that the zigzag-shaped wave (W) has ended. There has also completed the
linking down wave (X) as a zigzag too. There is now unfolding wave (Y).
It is composed of the sub-waves A-B-C, where wave A and C are impulses,
wave B is a zigzag-shaped correction. Let us explore the chart structure
in the eight-hour timeframe.

The final wave C is forming as a five-wave impulse within the upward
wave (Y). The first four legs should have completed within the impulse.
The final wave [5] is still unfolding. The price should be rising in
wave [5] towards a level of 507.00, which is the resistance level. Once
this level is reached, the price could turn down and start declining in
the new downtrend.

### Trading plan **[ETHUSD][2] **for the week:

Buy 450.40, TP 507.00

##  **Elliott wave Litecoin analysis**

 ****

The final leg of the global triple zigzag continues forming, that is
wave [Z] is forming. Wave [Z] is a double down zigzag that is composed
of the sub-waves (W)-(X)-(Y). The first two elements of this pattern
look complete. Wave (Y), composed of the sub-waves A-B-C, is still
unfolding. Let us study the price chart in more detail in the eight-hour
timeframe.

The down wave A has completed as a five-wave impulse as a five-wave
impulse. Next, the price has started rising in the corrective wave B.
Correction B is developing as a simple zigzag [A]-[B]-[C]. The market is
growing in the final bullish impulse [C]. This impulse should end at a
level of around 67.00, which is a little higher than the high hit by the
linking wave (X). Next, the market could start rising in the new
downtrend, as it outlined in the chart.

### Trading plan for **[LTCUSD][3]**  for the week:

Buy 60.31, TP 67.00

* * *

##  **Elliott wave EOS analysis**

 ****

The EOSUSD continues forming the global down corrective wave B as a
triple zigzag [W]-[X]-[Y]-[X]-[Z]. There is now unfolding the final leg
of this triple formation, the sub-wave [Z] that is composed of three
parts (A)-(B)-(C). After the bear impulse wave (A) completed, the market
has started forming the corrective wave (B) that is composed of the sub-
waves w-x-y. Let study this correction in more detail.

The sub-wave W and X have completed as zigzags within the corrective
wave (B). There is now forming the bullish wave Y. The price must be
growing in this wave to a level of 2.96. At this level, the corrective
wave (B) will reach the Fibonacci retracement of the bearish impulse
wave (A). Next, the cryptocurrency pair should start a new downtrend.

### Trading plan for **[EOSUSD][4]**  for the week

Buy 2.51, TP 2.96

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

 ****

There continue forming the global triple zigzag. The first four elements
of this pattern have completed. At the time of writing, there is forming
the final leg of the triple zigzag, the sub-wave [Z]. The [Z] wave is
developing as a simple zigzag (A)-(B)-(C). Let us study the structure of
wave [Z] in more detail in the H8 chart.

The impulse wave A has complete, it is composed of the sub-waves
1-2-3-4-5. Next, the market has started growing in the corrective wave
(B). Wave (B) is a simple standard zigzag A-B-C. The first two legs of
this zigzag have completed, but the impulse wave C is yet developing.
Most likely, the price should be rising in wave C to a level of 0.272,
where the entire correction (B) will reach 50% Fibonacci retracement of
the (A) impulse.

### Trading plan for **[XRPUSD][5]** for the week:

Buy 0.252, TP 0.272
