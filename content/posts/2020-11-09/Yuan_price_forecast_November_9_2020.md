Yuan rally continues. Forecast as of 09.11.2020Dmitri Demidenko

Enter sell trades and hold them down. This is a perfect strategy to
trade the USD versus the CNH. How long the downtrend will continue? Let
us discuss the yuan prospects and make up a [USDCNH][1] trading plan.

##  **Monthly yuan fundamental forecast**

Even a real cat could bounce if it falls from a great high. On the US
election day, the yuan volatility surged up to its all-time high. The
information that Donald Trump, despite the polls, could be re-elected,
sent the [USDCNH][1] up above 6.77. However, the buyers soon stepped
back. Experienced traders knew that the dollar’s surge versus the yuan
looked like a dead cat bounce.

The yuan has been 8.9% up against the US dollar from the lows hit in
March. There several reasons for renminbi growth. Beijing has fought the
pandemic; the Chinese economy is growing faster than other world’s
economies, the spread between the yields on the Chinese bonds and
Treasuries is broadening, and the growing chance of Biden’s victory.
During the trade war of 2018-2019, the renminbi has lost about 11.9% in
value, so it has almost fully recovered its positions.

During the election campaign, the democrat announced his willingness to
force China to play by international rules and that he would pursue a
tighter [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) relative to China than that of Trump. However, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s
see Biden as a better variant. He is not as wild, eccentric, and
unpredictable as Trump. Do, Biden is likely to create more friendly and
stable trade relations with China. Biden’s attack on China could be just
a part of the election campaign. After all, since the 1970s, Biden has
been an ardent supporter of improving relations with Bejing; and in
2011, he held extensive and warm meetings with Xi Jinping.

The tariffs on Chinese imports should remain, but they could be eased,
supporting the yuan’s growth. As recent [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) proves, neither the
pandemic nor a particular US president could hinder the process of
strengthening China's position in international trade.

###  **Dynamics of China’s foreign trade**

Due to the pandemic fallout's efficient management, China, unlike other
world economies, has averted the recession. The Chinese GDP, according
to the IMF forecasts, should grow by 1.9% in 2020. China’s 10-year bond
yield is 3.2%, compared to 0.8% Treasury yield. The talks about Biden’s
victory encouraged foreign [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s to increase the purchases of
China’s stocks up to ¥18.4 billion ($2.8 billion), which is the second
record [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) rate.

Beijing is willing to fulfill its obligations under the phase-one deal,
which is signaled by an increase in the US imports to China compared to
October totals.

### Monthly [USDCNH][1] trading plan

In my opinion, such factors as the divergence in the economic expansion
and monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), capital inflows to the Asian markets, lower risks
of new trade wars suggest the yuan should continue to rally. Besides,
the official Beijing is not willing to intervene and set the [USDCNH][1]
bears back. So, it is relevant to [continue][2] to sell the pair on the
price rise. The target at 6.5 close, and the renminbi may not stop
there.
