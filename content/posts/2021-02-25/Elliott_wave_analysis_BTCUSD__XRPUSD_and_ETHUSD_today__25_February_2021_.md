Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 25.02.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

Ripple must have finished the global bullish corrective wave [B].
Therefore, the XRPUSD market should be developing a short-term bearish
impulse.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

The BTCUSD market is forming a large fifth wave as an impulse composed
of the sub-waves 1-2-3-4-5. The extended wave 3 must have finished, and
the market is developing the bearish correction 4 as a double zigzag
[W]-[X]-[Y]. The first sub-wave [W] could have finished. There have also
completed two small sub-waves (a) and (b) of the zigzag-shaped linking
wave [X]. The final sub-wave (c) could drive the price up to a level of
54950.00, next, the market should start declining.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 50722.00, TP 54950.00

* * *

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

The most recent chart section displays the bearish zigzag with a deep
corrective wave [B], which is a triple zigzag. The [B] correction has
been unfolding since early February and seems to be complete. The market
is likely to develop a bearish impulse. The first four legs of the down
impulse must have completed. Therefore, the XRPUSD market should be
unfolding sub-wave (5) over the next few days. Wave (5) could end at a
level of around 0.333.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] today:

Sell 0.471, TP 0.333

* * *

## Elliott wave Ethereum analysis

The hourly timeframe of the ETHUSD price chart suggests that the upward
impulse wave C finished, and the market is moving down. The bearish
trend is developing as a double zigzag. The first zigzag-shaped wave [W]
has ended, and the Ethereum price should be rising in the upward linking
wave [X]. Waves (a) and (b) should have finished, so the market should
be rising in the impulse wave (c) to the local high at 1970.00.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Buy 1623.37, TP 1970.00
