Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 03.11.2020Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I suggest entry signals
to trade each cryptocurrency.

The XRPUSD market has started forming the initial part of the upward
wave [Z], which is likely to complete as a triple zigzag. It’s
approximate structure is outlined in the chart.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

 ****

The most recent section of the chart displays the upward impulse wave C
that started in late September 2020. The C wave is an element of the
linking wave [X]. The corrective wave [4] must have completed as a
double zigzag (w)-(x)-(y). Therefore, the price should be rising in the
final wave [5] towards level 15200.00. Next, when the entire upward
linking wave [X] completes, the Bitcoin price could turn down and start
forming a new downtrend.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 13627.00, TP 15200.00

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

 ****

The Ripple market continues forming the corrective wave B that is a
triple zigzag. In late October, the market has completed the linking
down wave [X] that is composed of the sub-waves (w)-(x)-(y)-(xx)-(z).
The market is now developing the beginning of the upward wave [Z] that
is likely to end as a triple zigzag. An approximate trajectory of the
Ripple future price movement is outlined in the chart. The assumed
pattern should end at level 0.263, which is the previous high.

### Trading plan for **[XRPUSD][2]** today:

Buy 0.234, TP 0.263

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

 ****

The ETHUSD market is forming the [Y] wave, which is the final element of
the corrective wave B that is a triple zigzag. Wave [Y] is unfolding as
a triple zigzag where the sub-waves (w)-(x)-(y)-(xx) have completed.
There is now forming the final wave (z), which could complete as a
simple zigzag a-b-c. The price should be rising in the bullish impulse
wave c to a level of 423.00, where the entire corrective wave B is to
finish. Next, the Ethereum price could start declining in a new
downtrend.

### Trading plan for  **[ETHUSD][3] **today:

Buy 384.19, TP 423.00
