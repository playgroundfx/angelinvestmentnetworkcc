Will Aussie repeat the hat trick? Forecast as of 03.11.2020Dmitri
Demidenko

The second quarter is likely to be the same as the second one. However,
the disaster is not going to be so dramatic. If so, we have a pattern to
trade the [AUDUSD][1]. Let us discuss the Australian dollar outlook and
make up a trading plan.

##  **Monthly Australian dollar fundamental analysis**

What doesn't kill makes one stronger. The RBA’s monetary expansion
should have crashed the Australian dollar. RBA not only cut the cash
rate down to the all-time low of 0.1% but also boosted the purchases of
assets with a maturity of 5-10 years within QE by AU$100 billion. The
RBA has become one of the first to react to the second pandemic wave.
However, the [AUDUSD][1], instead of falling, surged up to the bottom of
figure 71. Bloomberg experts anticipate such measures of the regulator,
and the time for maneuver was not right. It is not wise to ease monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) on the day of the US presidential election, is it?

According to Philip Lowe, the increase of the QE size will support
economic recovery amid lower costs of funding and exchange rate, as well
as higher assets’ price than it would be in the opposite case. RBA must
have tried to improve financial conditions, as the Fed did. It was one
of the reasons for the US economic growth in the third quarter. In the
fourth quarter, the US GDP should face a downturn because of the
difficult epidemiological situation. Australia, on the contrary, has
coped with the coronavirus through a strict lockdown in Victoria. So,
Australia’s GDP can well go up.

According to the RBA forecasts, Australia’s GDP in the 2020/2021
financial year will expand by 6%, in 2021/2022 - by another 4%. The
forecast for the unemployment peak has been cut from 10% to 8%. The core
inflation will grow by 1% in 2021, and by 1.5% in 2022.

In addition to the domestic positive factors, foreign [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) also supports
Aussie. Despite the disputes between Australia and China, which imposed
tariffs on Australian barley, launched an anti-dumping investigation
into Australian wine, and suspended imports of coal and lobsters from
Australia, I believe that the trade relationships will be improved.
China is the largest market for Australia. China’s economic growth by
1.9%, according to the IMF forecast, will support the AUDUSD bulls.
Based on the yuan price changes, the [AUDUSD][1] looks undervalued.

### Monthly [AUDUSD][1] trading plan

In general, market sentiment indicates that the fourth quarter for the
global economy will be similar to the second one, although the disaster
scale will be smaller. If so, we have a pattern to trade the Aussie. [In
late March][2], I recommended buying the Australian dollar in the range
of $0.59-$0.62 amid the expectations of the V-shaped recovery of China’s
economy, and this trading idea was winning. Now, there is another chance
to repeat the hat trick provided that Joe Biden wins the election.

Biden also promises to attack China for its economic and human rights
violations, the US-China relations are going to improve. As a result,
the entire Pacific region will benefit. Australia, with its successful
COVID-19 strategy, is no exception. If Biden wins, buy the [AUDUSD][1]
with targets at 0.729 and 0.733.
