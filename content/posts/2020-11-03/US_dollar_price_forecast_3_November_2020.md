Dollar fell into liquidity trap. Forecast as of 03.11.2020Dmitri
Demidenko

The monetary expansion may not work because of huge volumes of cheap
liquidity. So, the euro might have fallen too deep amid the ECB’s hints
at the QE expansion. Let us discuss it and make up a [EURUSD][1] trading
plan.

##  **Weekly US dollar fundamental forecast**

39 out of 60 experts polled by Reuters believe that the US presidential
election is to be the strongest driver for the US dollar over the next
few weeks. Almost 70% of the experts say that the dollar shorts should
remain the same or increase. According to Standard Chartered, the USD
rise at the end of October must be used to enter sell trades as the
traders tend to get rid of the dollars. The consensus forecast suggests
the [EURUSD][1] rally towards 1.18 and 1.21 in 1 and 12 months. However,
the majority is not always right.

The euro drawdown results from a new wave of COVID-19 in Europe,
lockdowns, and concerns about a double-dip recession. Furthermore, the
ECB is to expand monetary stimulus, and the political situation in the
USA remains uncertain. After the US election is over, the factor of
uncertainty will cease supporting the [EURUSD][1] bears, unless Donald
Trump rejects the vote results, of course. The second pandemic wave is a
strong factor. However, the most recent reports on the euro-area
manufacturing PMI signal that the economy adjusts to the pandemic.
Italy’s and Spain’s PMI data are better than expected, Germany's economy
in one of the best performers. The lockdowns in France and Germany
should not last long.

The ECB’s suggested expansion of the QE and interest rate cut in
December could have weakened the euro far stronger in usual conditions.
The [EURUSD][1] drop under the current unusual conditions doesn’t look
natural. Since the pandemic started, the world’s central banks provided
monetary stimulus worth $12 trillion, 97% of the advanced economies
lowered the interest rates below 1%. In a fifth of the entire world, the
interest rates are negative, QE will surprise no one, but inflation does
not grow. The global economy got in the liquidity trap, the monetary
expansion doesn’t work, and the risk of currency wars increases. The
ECB’s willingness to boost the stimulus might be just a verbal
intervention. If so, the euro has fallen too deep.

The euro can resume the uptrend, especially since [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are
confident in Joe Biden’s victory. However, the drop in the stock and
bond markets ahead of the election signals that most [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s hold
cash, and they should invest this money somewhere.

### Weekly [EURUSD][1] trading plan

Where will [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s put the money in? First of all, in Asia. The US
assets are also quite appealing. Almost a 6% drop in the [S&P 500][2] at
the end of October encourages [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s to buy stocks. They also
consider buying Treasuries, as the US Treasury has lowered its forecast
for issuing government bonds from $1.2 trillion to $617 billion. If so,
the Fed could monetary normalization sooner than in the case of Trump’s
victory. If Biden wins, the [EURUSD][1] is likely to rise towards 1.17
and 1.1735. However, if the [S&P 500][2] falls amid the absence of a
‘blue wave,’ the euro will also fall.
