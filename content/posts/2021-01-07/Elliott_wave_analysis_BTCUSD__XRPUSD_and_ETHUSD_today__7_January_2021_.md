Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 07.01.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I suggest entry signals
to trade each cryptocurrency.

Bitcoin and Ethereum are rising in the impulse waves; Ripple is forming
a bearish ending diagonal.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

 ****

The BTCUSD market is forming the bullish impulse wave (5), with four
legs out of five completed inside. There is now developing the final
motive wave 5 as an upward five-wave impulse. Wave [3] should soon end
at a level of around 38600.00. Next, following a short decline in the
corrective wave [4], the Bitcoin price will continue rising in wave [5],
as it is outlined in the chart.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 37399.00 TP 38600.00

* * *

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

 ****

The XRPUSD market is forming the bearish impulse wave C composed of five
sub-waves [1]-[2]-[3]-[4]-[5]. The first four legs of this impulse have
completed. There is now forming wave [5] as an ending diagonal. The
corrective wave (4) must have completed as a triple zigzag. The price
should be declining in the final wave (5) to a level of 0.100.

### Trading plan for **[XRPUSD][2]** today:

Sell 0.291, TP 0.100

## Elliott wave Ethereum analysis

 ****

The ETHUSD market is forming the fifth wave of a larger bullish impulse.
Wave 5 is also an impulse. There have completed four sub-waves
[1]-[2]-[3]-[4], and wave [5] is still forming. The corrective wave (iv)
must have finished, and the price is rising in wave (v). This wave
should complete at a level of around 1270.00. Next, a new downtrend
should start.

### Trading plan for  **[ETHUSD][3] **today:

Buy 1200.70, TP 1270.00
