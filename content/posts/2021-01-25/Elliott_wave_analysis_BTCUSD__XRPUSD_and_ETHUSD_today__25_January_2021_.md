Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 25.01.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

All three cryptocurrency pairs covered in the article are forming the
initial elements of the fifth sub-waves.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

The BTCUSD market is forming an upward impulse with corrective wave 4
completed inside. Correction 4 has ended as a bearish double zigzag
[W]-[X]-[Y]. Next, the price turned up and started rising in the bullish
wave 5. The first short sub-waves of impulse 5 must have completed.
Therefore, the market should be rising to a level above 35771.45.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 33331.00 TP 35771.45

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

The XRPUSD market must have ended the corrective wave 4 as a bearish
double zigzag [W]-[X]-[Y]. Next, the market has turned up and started
rising. There should be developing the initial element of the impulse
wave 5. A short corrective wave [2] is a double zigzag. The price should
be rising to a level above 0.330, which is the high made by the linking
wave [X].

### Trading plan for **[XRPUSD][2]** today:

Buy 0.276, TP 0.330

## Elliott wave Ethereum analysis

The ETHUSD market is rising in the impulse wave. The corrective wave 4
has recently completed as a complex formation composed of the sub-waves
[w]-[x]-[y]. There is now forming the impulse upwave with the first two
short legs [1] and [2] completed inside. Therefore, the price should be
rising to a level above 1570.00. One could enter purchases in the
current situation.

### Trading plan for  **[ETHUSD][3] **today:

Buy 1414.80, TP 1570.00
