Euro adjusts the plans. Forecast as of 25.01.2021Dmitri Demidenko

A poor reading of the euro-area PMI hasn’t discouraged the [EURUSD][1]
bulls. However, the euro rally may face several obstacles. Let us
discuss the Forex outlook and make up a trading plan.

## Weekly euro fundamental forecast

The euro-area economy is about to slide into a double-dip recession.
According to Bloomberg's source familiar with the matter, Germany's
government should revise the GDP forecast down from 4.4% to 3% in 2021.
Vaccination is progressing extremely slowly in Europe, and the EU
countries extend lockdowns. Nonetheless, the euro continues rising. When
all major currencies are going down, the [EURUSD][1] is growing because
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s believe the dollar is falling faster than the euro. The dollar
has different reasons for a downtrend.

The market believes the US-China relationships are all right, the US QE
is not likely to scale down, and there should be a new fiscal stimulus
package of $1.9 trillion provided by Joe Biden. As long as the greed
encourages [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s, the [S&P 500][2] continues to rally up, and safe-
haven assets are under pressure. The situation could turn upside down at
any moment. The Republicans are not willing to give up power in the
Senate. The dispute between the Congress and the White House could
trigger a drawdown in the US stock market. About 88% of 40 experts
surveyed by Bloomberg believe that the Fed's next step will be to slow
down the QE monthly pace.

### Forecasts for the US QE

The euro-area composite PMI has been down to 47.5 in January, which
signals an economic downturn. I suppose the euro is growing because
purchasing managers’ optimism about the next 12 months improved to a
three-year high for manufacturers. Investors understand that everything
is bad now but continue to stay positive. The markets are growing on the
rumors. However, the November-December plans need to be adjusted.

### Dynamics of euro-area PMIs

In Late 2020, amid the introduction of COVID-19 vaccines, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s were
full of optimism about a soon victory over the pandemic and the
associated end of lockdowns, followed by a rapid rebound of the global
GDP and international trade. The [EURUSD][1] rally was natural. The US
dollar, being a safe haven, didn’t have any chances. It was the end of
Donald Trump’s age marked with extreme uncertainty when Twitter was more
important than economic data.

### Weekly [EURUSD][1] trading plan

In January, it turned out that the plans had to be postponed. This is
due to the ongoing pandemic and slow vaccination. Three weeks should
pass between the first and second injection, then three more to develop
immunity. Obviously, the victory over the coronavirus is postponed, so
why continue to buy euros? The [EURUSD][1] bulls begin to doubt. If the
[S&P 500][2] goes down because of Congress or China, the euro could also
fall. If the euro bulls fail to hold up the price above $1.2125 and
$1.208, it will be the first sign of their weakness.

After all, as long as the [S&P 500][2] is strong, and the Fed is willing
to keep the interest rates low and the QE pace unchanged, the breakout
of resistance levels at 1.221 and 1.224 can support the [EURUSD][1]
rally. I do not believe the rise will be high without the vaccination
acceleration.
