analysis Bitcoin, Ripple, Ethereum.][2]**

It is clear from the H2 BTCUSD price chart that the market is being
corrected now, after the bullish impulse wave A ended. The initial
element of the bearish double zigzag [W]-[X]-[Y] is forming. The down
wave [W] is about to finish soon. The sub-waves (A) and (B) have ended,
and the price resumed declining in the final impulse (C). A short
correction 4 should end soon, and the market will go down in wave 5
towards a level of 9700. An approximate trajectory of the Bitcoin future
price movement is outlined in the chart.

The XRPUSD market has started declining in the impulse wave (A) after
the upward linking wave [X], composed of three sub-waves (A)-(B)-(C),
completed. The first leg of the (A) impulse, the five-wave impulse 1 of
a smaller degree, has completed; the bullish correction 2 has also
ended. The market is forming the bear impulse wave 3. Therefore, the
price should continue declining in wave 3. When wave 3 completes, the
market will follow wave 4 and 5, as it is outlined in the chart.

The ETHUSD market finished the upward wave (Y) as a zigzag. The
downtrend is now developing. There is now forming the bear impulse wave
A, which is composed of five sub-waves [1]-[2]-[3]-[4]-[5]. The first
three legs of the A wave have completed, and the price is rising in the
corrective wave [4]. Wave [4] should finish soon. Next, the price is
likely to start declining in the final wave [5], as it is outlined in
the chart.
