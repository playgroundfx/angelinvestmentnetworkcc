USDCHF: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 23.07.21 – 30.07.21Alex
Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 0.9269 with a target of 0.9096 – 0.9055.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
0.9269 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 0.9370 –
0.9476.

 **Analysis:** Daily time frame: presumably, a descending first wave of
larger degree (1) of 5 was formed and an ascending correction is now
developing as second wave (2) of 5. On the H4 time frame, wave A of (2)
was formed and wave B of (2) finished developing. Apparently, wave С of
(2) started developing on the H1 time frame, with a downward correction
developing inside as wave ii of C. If this assumption is correct, the
pair will continue to fall to 0.9096 – 0.9055. The level of 0.9269 is
critical in this scenario. Its breakout will allow the pair to continue
rising to the levels of 0.9370 – 0.9476.
