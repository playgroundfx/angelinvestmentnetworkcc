USDJPY: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 23.07.21 – 30.07.21Alex
Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 111.66 with a target of 108.20 – 107.09.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
111.66 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 113.50 –
115.00.

 **Analysis:** Daily TM: apparently, a descending correction of larger
degree finished forming as wave B, and wave С started developing, with
the first wave (1) of С forming inside.

The third wave of smaller degree 3 of (1) continues developing on the H4
time frame, with wave i of 3 formed and a downside correction developing
as wave ii of 3 inside. On the H1 time frame, apparently, wave (а) of ii
formed and wave (b) of ii is developing at the moment. If the
presumption is correct, the pair will continue to fall to the levels of
108.20 – 107.09 after correction. The level of 111.66 is critical in
this scenario as a breakout will enable the pair to continue growing to
the levels of 113.50 – 115.00.
