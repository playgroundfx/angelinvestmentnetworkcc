USDCAD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 23.07.21 – 30.07.21Alex
Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 1.2811 with a target of 1.2000 – 1.1850.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
1.2811 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 1.3413 –
1.3722.

 **Analysis:** wave (С) of 4 of larger degree continues developing in
the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) chart, with the third wave 3 of (C) formed as part of it.
Presumably, an ascending correction is completed as wave 4 of (С) on the
H4 time frame, with wave c of 4 formed inside. Apparently, the fifth
wave 5 of (C) started developing on the H1 time frame, with the first
counter-trend wave of smaller degree i of 5 forming inside. If the
presumption is correct, the pair will continue to drop to the levels of
1.2000 – 1.1850. The level of 1.2811 is critical in this scenario as a
breakout will enable the pair to continue rising to the levels of 1.3413
– 1.3722.
