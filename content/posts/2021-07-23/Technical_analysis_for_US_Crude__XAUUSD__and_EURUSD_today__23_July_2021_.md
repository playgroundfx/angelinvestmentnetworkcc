Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 23.07.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

Yesterday, sellers were able to update the day's low but failed to reach
the Target Zone 1789 - 1784.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

Oil continues to strengthen. Yesterday, buyers broke out the Target Zone
70.80 - 70.27. The next target is the Gold Zone 73.19 - 72.92. It is
profitable to look for new oil purchases on correction to a short-term
uptrend.

Additional Zone 70.51 - 70.38 and Intermediary Zone 69.19 - 68.92 serve
as strong supports for opening purchases. A pattern is required to enter
a trade. The first target for purchases is at the breakthrough of the
local high.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

  1. Buy according to the pattern in Additional Zone 70.51 - 70.38. TakeProfit: 71.70. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. Buy according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 69.19 - 68.92. TakeProfit: 71.70. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

Yesterday, sellers were able to update the day's low but failed to reach
the Target Zone 1789 - 1784.  After updating the low and testing level
1795, the price went into correction. As part of the correction, the
Additional Zone 1805 - 1804 was broken out. Now the target for purchases
is the Intermediary Zone 1817 - 1815.

Today, consider gold purchases at the current prices (1805 - 1807) with
a target in the Intermediary Zone.

To enter gold sales, a corresponding pattern is required, which is not
currently on the price chart.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

Aggressive: buy from the level of 1806. TakeProfit: Intermediary Zone
1817 - 1815. StopLoss: 1800.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

Yesterday the euro trades were volatile. The ECB's interest rate
decision was released. The rate was left unchanged, followed by a press
conference by the ECB president Christine Lagarde. She said nothing new,
so the price fluctuated both up and down.

According to the margin zones' methodology, the short-term trend remains
down. Now traders are trying to break out the support zone 1.1762 -
1.1754. If successful, the price will decline to the Gold Zone 1.1711 -
1.1702. Otherwise, expect the price in the Intermediary Zone 1.1848 -
1.1840.
