GBPUSD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 23.07.21 – 30.07.21Alex
Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions from corrections above the
level of 1.3565 with a target of  1.4017 – 1.4253.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
1.3565 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of 1.3153
– 1.2818.

 **Analysis:** Daily time frame: the first wave of larger degree (1)
finished developing, with wave 5 of (1) formed inside. A descending
correction appears to have formed as wave (2) on the H4 time frame, with
wave C of (2) completed inside. Apparently, the third wave (3) started
developing on the H1 time frame, with the first counter-trend wave of
smaller degree i of 1 of (3) forming inside. If the presumption is
correct, the pair will continue to rise to the levels of 1.4017 –
1.4253. The level of 1.3565 is critical in this scenario as its breakout
will enable the pair to continue declining to the levels of 1.3153 –
1.2818.
