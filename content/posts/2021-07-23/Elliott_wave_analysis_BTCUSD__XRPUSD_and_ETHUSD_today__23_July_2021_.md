Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 23.07.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

All three cryptocurrency pairs covered in the article should be rising
over the next few days. Let us study the market situation for each pair
in detail.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

The BTCUSD market is forming an upward corrective wave [B] as a double
zigzag. There may have completed the descending linking wave (X) as a
triple zigzag W-X-Y-X-Z. There is unfolding the upward motive wave (Y).
The Bitcoin price should go up to a level above 34700.00. One could
enter buy trades in the current situation.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 32575.50, TP 34700.00

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

##

In late June, the XRPUSD market finished forming the descending wave
(W). Next, there started the upward double zigzag W-X-Y. So far, there
have completed sub-waves W and X, a standard zigzag and a triple zigzag.
The Ripple price should be rising in the final motive wave Y to a level
much higher than the high of 0.655, marked with the linking wave [X].
One could enter purchases in the current situation.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] **** today:

Buy 0.594, TP 0.655

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

The ETHUSD market is forming the corrective wave B, an element of the
regular bullish zigzag. Wave B is composed of three sub-waves
[A]-[B]-[C], two of which have completed. The market is now rising in
the inceptive part of the upward wave [C], which should be an impulse.
The Ethereum price should be rising to a level above 2172.00. It is
relevant to open buy positions.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Buy 2054.53, TP 2172.00
