Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 22.10.2020Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I suggest entry signals
to trade each cryptocurrency.

Bitcoin is forming a large zigzag, inside which a contracting triangle
has been completed, and the price is now rising in a bullish impulse C.
The approximate pattern of future movement is shown on the chart.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

 ****

As part of a bullish linking wave [X] which takes the form of a double
zigzag (W)-(X)-(Y), the final zigzag (Y), consisting of sub-waves A-B-C,
is developing. Corrective wave B is a flat pattern, a contracting
triangle [A]-[B]-[C]-[D]-[E]. An upward impulse wave C is developing
now. Most likely, the first two parts of this impulse are completed, and
at the moment wave [3] is forming. It will probably be completed close
to the level of 13383.37 - at this level, impulse wave [3] will be
161.8% of impulse [1]. Then, after a slight decline in the corrective
wave [4], the final wave [5] will rise to the level of 15200.00.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 12924.75, TP 13383.37

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

 ****

On XRPUSD chart, we see a corrective wave B developing, it is a triple
zigzag [W]-[X]-[Y]-[X]-[Z]. The first four parts of this pattern have
already been completed. Currently, an actionary wave [Z] is being
formed, which may take the form of a simple zigzag (a)-(b)-(c). Perhaps
the impulse wave (a) and the correction (b) have already been built, and
now the price is rising in impulse (c). In the near future, the
cryptocurrency pair is expected to rise to the level of 0.273.

### Trading plan for **[XRPUSD][2]** today:

Buy 0.253, TP 0.273

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

 ****

Corrective wave B is developing, it takes the form of a double zigzag
[W]-[X]-[Y]. The final wave [Y] is in developing in the form of a zigzag
(A)-(B)-(C). We see that impulse (A) and zigzag correction (B) have
fully completed their patterns, while impulse wave (C) is still
developing. Correction 4, which is a double zigzag, has recently been
completed, and then the market began to rise in wave 5. The price may
rise to 430.00 in the indicated wave.

### Trading plan  **[ETHUSD][3] **today:

Buy 395.59, TP 430.00
