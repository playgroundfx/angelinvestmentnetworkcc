Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 08.10.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

The short-term oil uptrend resumed yesterday at the US trading session.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

The short-term oil uptrend resumed yesterday at the US trading session
after a strong decline at the European session. As a result, the
Intermediary Zone 77.54 - 77.28 was broken out. Now the target for
purchases is the upper Target Zone 80.34 - 79.83.

It is quite possible that a wide sideways trend will be formed between
levels 79.44 and 75.47. Therefore, it is possible to consider short
trades aggressively near the resistance level.

As for further growth, buyers need to consolidate the price above level
80.35. In this case, the next target will be the Gold Zone 82.64 -
82.38.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

Aggressive: Sell according to the PriceAction pattern in the level of
79.44. TakeProfit: 75.47. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

Gold continues to trade between two strong levels. Above, Target zone
1767 - 1763 serves as the resistance. Below the support is the
Intermediary Zone 1751 - 1749.

Yesterday there was an opportunity to sell the precious metal in the
level of 1764 with the target of 1747. These trades should be at
breakeven on hold. After reaching the target, see if sellers can
consolidate the price below level 1747. If successful, the short-term
trend will reverse down, and the target for new sales will be the Target
Zone 1733 - 1729.

An alternative scenario suggests a breakout of the resistance level of
1764, moving to the next level of 1769 and price consolidation above. In
this case, the trend will continue, and the Gold Zone 1786 - 1784 will
serve as the target for purchases.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

  1. Hold sell trades entered in the zone of level 1765. TakeProfit: 1747. StopLoss: at breakeven.

  2. Buy when level 1769 is broken out. TakeProfit: Gold Zone 1786 - 1784. StopLoss: 1764.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

A short-term euro downtrend continues. Now the bears are trying to break
out the Target Zone 2 1.1557 - 1.1539. If successful, the next target
will be Gold Zone 2 1.1469 - 1.1460. A breakout of level 1.1537 is
required to enter sales.

In case of a trend reversal, the price will rise to the Additional Zone
1.1577 - 1.1569 and break it out. Then it will be possible to join
buyers and hold long trades to the Intermediary Zone 1.1626 - 1.1617. A
signal to enter will be a breakout of level 1.1577.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

  1. Aggressive: sell when level 1.1537 is broken out. TakeProfit: Gold Zone 2 1.1469 - 1.1460. StopLoss: 1.1552.

  2. Aggressive: buy when level 1.1577 is broken out. TakeProfit: Intermediary Zone 1.1626 - 1.1617. StopLoss: 1.1557.
