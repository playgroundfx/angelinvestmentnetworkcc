Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 08.10.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

It seems that Ripple has completed a small triangle-shaped correction,
so expect the price to rise in the coming days.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

The BTCUSD market is building a correction [B], in the form of a simple
zigzag (A)-(B)-(C). The first two parts of this zigzag are fully
completed, and the last part, impulse wave (C), is still unfolding. Most
likely, shortly, the price will correct within wave 4, which is part of
the impulse (C). Completion of this correction is expected at level
50111.00. At this level, wave 4 will be 38.2% of the impulse sub-wave 3.
Therefore, one could enter sell trades.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Sell 53857.55, TP 50111.00

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

The XRPUSD market is developing a downward corrective trend in the shape
of a W-X-Y double zigzag. Currently, an upward linking wave X is forming
as a simple zigzag [A]-[B]-[C]. The last impulse wave [C] is currently
under construction. It seems that it has completed a triangle correction
(4). Therefore, shortly, the price could continue rising within wave (5)
to the level of 1.200. Therefore, it is reasonable to consider entering
buy trades.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] **** today:

Buy 1.062, TP 1.200

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

Ethereum is building a zigzag correction B. It consists of subwaves
[A]-[B]-[C]. The bullish impulse wave [C] is developing now. It is
assumed that the construction of the upward impulse wave (3) has come to
an end. Thus, shortly, a fall to the level of 3200.00 within the
correction (4) is possible. At the indicated level, wave (4) will be 50%
of wave (3). It is profitable to consider entering sell trades in the
current situation.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Sell 3569.12, TP 3200.00
