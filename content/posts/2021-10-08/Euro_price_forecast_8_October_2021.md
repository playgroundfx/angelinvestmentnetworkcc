Let euro take a nap! Forecast as of 08.10.2021Dmitri Demidenko

There is hardly anyone doubting that the Fed will start the cessation of
QE in November. Russian interference will stabilize the gas market. All
important events will happen in December, and until that time [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s
may relax. How will this affect [EURUSD][1]? Let's discuss it and make
up a trading plan.

## Weekly Euro fundamental forecast

At first glance, the Senate's approval of the idea of ​​raising the US
national debt ceiling by December has eased the tension in the financial
markets. In fact, this decision has exposed the problem they face.
Markets do a poor job of assessing events with significant consequences
that are unlikely to occur. The result is complacency, which often ends
in an explosion. This was the case with the referendum on Brexit, with
the presidential elections in the United States that ended with the
victory of Donald Trump and with the pandemic in 2020. Will the same
happen with the default? At least not now.

Since 1993, a way out of the national debt dead-end has been found 25
times, so the complacency of the markets is understandable. Yes, in 2011
the farce between Republicans and Democrats ended with a downgrade of
the US credit rating, but in 2013 the markets ignored the problem. And
they did the right thing. It should be noted that minor defaults have
already happened in American [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/), in 1812, 1933 and 1976, even
though Janet Yellen says otherwise. Besides, shocks are usually caused
by non-payments associated with revolutions and not with party
infighting. Nevertheless, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s have the opportunity to postpone the
topic of the public debt ceiling until December and concentrate on the
energy crisis and the mistakes of central banks.

What is happening in the global debt markets at the moment is the result
of regulators misjudging the situation. They were either wrong before,
arguing that inflation was temporary, or now, hinting at the tightening
of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) in the future. In fact, this tightening is already
taking place, which is clearly seen in the dynamics of bond yields. And
the split within the ECB is a direct consequence of the fact that
officials are beginning to realize their own mistakes. According to the
minutes of the September meeting of the Governing Council, several of
its members pushed for more aggressive cuts in asset purchases and
warned that current inflation forecasts (2.2% in 2021, 1.7% in 2022 and
1.5% in 2023) are wrong. A high CPI will be long lasting, and a regime
change should not be ruled out. For example, the 1970s with their supply
shock may return.

The opinion of the "hawks" is confirmed by the dynamics of inflation
expectations, which have recently been growing faster in Europe than in
the US.

Of course, the energy crisis, associated with the dependence of the Old
World on gas, had an impact on this. In theory, a faster rise in prices
in the eurozone than in the United States should push the ECB to
normalize and deprive the bears on [EURUSD][1] of such a trump card as
divergence in monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). The problem is that the next meeting of
the Governing Council will take place on December 2, and before that the
markets will return to their usual state. Complacency.

### [EURUSD][2] trading plan for the week

I do not think that the September US employment report will seriously
affect the balance of power in the main currency pair. Most likely, in
the second half of autumn, it will enter a state of consolidation,
expecting a December that will be full of events. It remains only to
understand where the intermediate minimum is located. Is it at 1.145 -
1.1485 or at the current levels?
