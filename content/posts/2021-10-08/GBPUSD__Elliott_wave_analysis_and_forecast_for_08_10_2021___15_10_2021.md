GBPUSD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 08.10.2021 –
15.10.2021Alex Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 1.3918 with a target of 1.3157 – 1.2821.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
1.3918 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 1.4050 –
1.4241.

 **Analysis:** Daily chart: the first wave of larger degree (1) is
formed, and a downside correction continues forming as wave (2). H4
chart: waves A of (2) and B of (2) are formed, and wave C of (2) is
developing. Apparently, the first wave of smaller degree i of C is
developing on the H1 chart, with a correction nearing completion as wave
(iv) of i inside. If the presumption is correct, the pair will continue
to drop to the levels of 1.3157 – 1.2821. The level of 1.3918 is
critical in this scenario as a breakout will enable the pair to continue
rising to the levels of 1.4050 – 1.4241.
