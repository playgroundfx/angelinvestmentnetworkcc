USDCAD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 08.10.2021 –
15.10.2021Alex Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 1.2650 with a target of 1.2478 – 1.2367.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
1.2650 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 1.3090 –
1.3250.

 **Analysis:** A descending correction appears to have formed as the
fourth wave 4 of larger degree on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) chart, with wave (С) of 4
completed and wave 5 unfolding inside. H4 chart: wave 1 of (1) of 5 is
formed, and a downward correction is developing as wave 2 of (1) of 5,
with wave b of 2 completed as part of it. Apparently, wave с of 2 is
forming on the H1 chart. Inside it, there is the first wave of smaller
degree (i) of c formed, a local correction (ii) of c completed, and the
third wave (iii) of c unfolding. If the presumption is correct, the pair
will continue to drop to the levels of 1.2478 – 1.2367. The level of
1.2650 is critical in this scenario as a breakout will enable the pair
to continue rising to the levels of 1.3090 – 1.3250.
