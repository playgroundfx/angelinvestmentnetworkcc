USDJPY: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 08.10.2021 –
15.10.2021Alex Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 112.08 with a target of 110.59 – 110.24.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
112.08 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 113.50 –
115.00.

 **Analysis:** Daily chart: apparently, a descending correction of
larger degree finished forming as wave B, and wave С started developing,
with the first wave (1) of С forming inside. The third wave of smaller
degree 3 of (1) continues developing on the H4 chart, with wave i of 3
formed and a correction completed as wave ii of 3 inside. Apparently,
wave iii of 3 started developing on the H1 chart, with wave (i) of iii
formed and a downside correction developing as wave (ii) of iii inside.
If the presumption is correct, the pair may be expected to drop to the
levels of 110.59 – 110.24. The level of 112.08 is critical in this
scenario as a breakout will enable the pair to continue growing to the
levels of 113.50 – 115.00.
