USDCHF: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 08.10.2021 –
15.10.2021Alex Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions from corrections above the
level of 0.9204 with a target of 0.9506 – 0.9685.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
0.9204 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of 0.9103
– 0.9018.

 **Analysis:** Daily chart: presumably, a descending first wave of
larger degree (1) of 5 is formed, and an ascending correction is now
developing as second wave (2) of 5. Wave C of (2) continues developing
on the H4 chart. Wave i of C is formed, a corrective wave ii of C is
completed, and wave iii of C is unfolding as parts of wave C of (2). The
third wave of smaller degree (iii) of iii appears to have formed on the
H1 chart, and a corrective wave (iv) of iii is developing at the moment.
If the presumption is correct, the pair will continue to rise to the
levels of 0.9506 – 0.9685 after correction. The level of 0.9204 is
critical in this scenario. Its breakout will allow the pair to continue
falling to the levels of 0.9103 – 0.9018.
