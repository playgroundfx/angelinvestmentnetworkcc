XAUUSD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 08.10.2021 –
15.10.2021Alex Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions from corrections above the
level of 1719.63 with a target of 1915.00 – 2075.27.

 **Alternative scenario:** Breakout and consolidation below the level of
1719.63 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of
1673.63 – 1602.20.

 **Analysis:** Daily chart: an ascending third wave of larger degree (3)
is formed, a descending correction developed as the fourth wave (4),
and, supposedly, the fifth wave (5) started unfolding. H4 chart:
apparently, the first wave of smaller degree 1of (5) is formed, a
corrective wave 2 of (5) is completed, and wave 3 of (5) started
unfolding. On the H1 chart, a local correction finished developing as
wave ii of 3, supposedly, and wave iii of 3 is starting to form, with
wave (i) of iii developing as part of it. If the presumption is correct,
the pair will continue to rise to the levels of 1915.00 – 2075.27. The
level of 1719.63 is critical in this scenario as a breakout will enable
the pair to continue declining to the levels of 1673.63 – 1602.20.
