Medium-term forecast for oil, gold, and EURUSD 05.02.2021Alex Rodionov

I welcome my colleagues! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest trading
signals for traders who trade in medium-term trends.

The eurozone consumer price index was in the positive zone for the first
time since September last year. Processes have begun that can increase
inflation without further increasing the QE program.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for next week: USCrude analysis

Medium and long-term oil trends are up. Growth is supported by a
reduction in US inventories and an OPEC+ plan to maintain oil production
restrictions. According to energy experts, as the developed world's
economies recover in 2021, the oil demand will grow.

WTI oil prices have consolidated above the resistance level Target Zone
4 [54.72 - 54.21]. The target for the new week is Target Zone 5 [59.82 -
59.31].

The trend key support is moving to the levels [52.18 - 51.72]. Consider
new purchases in the levels 53.90 - 53.62 (the border of the previous
sideways trend). The first target for purchases will be to update this
week's high.

### [USCrude][1] Trading tips for the upcoming week:

  1. Open buy positions according to the pattern in [53.90 - 53.62]. TakeProfit: 56.60, Target Zone 5 [59.82 - 59.31]. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. Open buy positions according to the pattern in [52.18 - 51.72]. TakeProfit: 56.60, Target Zone 5 [59.82 - 59.31]. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Gold price forecast for next week: XAUUSD analysis

Gold prices fell throughout the week due to the lack of demand for
precious metals from major players. Other reasons may be the slow
recovery of economies after the COVID-19 pandemic and the US dollar's
strengthening.

The medium-term gold trend reversed down since the ​​accumulation [1859
- 1818] zone was broken out. The price has consolidated below this zone.
The next target for the medium-term downtrend is Target Zone 2 [1759 -
1749].

Calculate the trend key resistance from yesterday's low and get the
boundaries [1906 - 1895]. Thus, there are two areas to search for sales
for the next week, the first of which is the broken out border of the
sideways trend [1825 - 1818].

### [XAUUSD][2] Trading tips for the upcoming week:

  1. Sell according to the pattern in the zone of [1825 - 1818]. TakeProfit: Target Zone 2 [1759 - 1749]. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. Sell according to the pattern in the zone of [1906 - 1895]. TakeProfit: 1785, Target Zone 2 [1759 - 1749]. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Euro/dollar price forecast for next week: EURUSD analysis

The eurozone consumer price index was in the positive zone for the first
time since September last year. At the same time, it turned out to be
higher than forecast by 0.5% YoY, at a value of 0.9% YoY. Processes have
begun that can increase inflation without further increasing the QE
program.

How does this affect EURUSD? The growth of inflation leads to a decrease
in the exchange rate of the euro. So, in the medium term, expect a
further euro price fall, but there's one "but".

This week the priority model for sale was worked out, mainly driven by
the [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/). Target Zone 2 [1.1981 - 1.1962] was reached and is still being
held by traders.

Next week, holding this area will allow considering long trades in the
correction, while the breakout and consolidation of the price below will
open the way for a new fall with the target in the Target Zone 3 [1.1797
- 1.1778].

The border of the downtrend is shifting to the levels [1.2128 - 1.2112].
If to consider corrective growth and then a further fall, then the best
sell prices are in the zone.

### [EURUSD][3] Trading tips for the upcoming week:

  1. If the support is held in Target Zone 2 [1.1981 - 1.1962] - buy according to the pattern. TakeProfit: Target Zone [1.2128 - 1.2112]. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. Sell according to the pattern in Target Zone [1.2128 - 1.2112]. TakeProfit: 1.1955. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.
