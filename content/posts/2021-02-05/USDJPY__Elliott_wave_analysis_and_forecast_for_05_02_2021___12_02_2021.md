USDJPY: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 05.02.2021 –
12.02.2021Alex Geuta

 **Main scenario:** short positions will be relevant below the level of
106.16 with a target of 101.74 – 100.00.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
106.16 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 107.01 –
108.18.

 **Analysis:** Daily time frame: presumably, a correction of larger
degree is completed in the form of wave (B). Wave (С) has started to
form, with the third wave 3 of (C) developing inside. The third wave of
smaller degree iii of 3 formed on the H4 time frame, and an ascending
correction is nearing completion as the fourth wave iv of 3. Apparently,
wave (c) of iv is nearing completion on the H1 time frame. If this
assumption is correct, the pair will continue to fall to the levels of
101.74 – 100.00 once the correction’s over. The level of 106.16 is
critical in this scenario as the breakout will enable the pair to
continue growing to the levels of 107.01 – 108.18.
