XAUUSD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 05.02.2021 –
12.02.2021Alex Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions from corrections above the
level of 1764.71 with a target of 1960.41 – 2073.73.

 **Alternative scenario:** Breakout and consolidation below the level of
1764.71 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of
1718.57 – 1668.45.

 **Analysis:** Daily time frame: presumably, the ascending third wave of
larger degree (3) formed, and a descending correction developed as wave
(4). The fifth wave (5) appears to be developing on the H4 time frame,
with wave 1 of (5) formed and a local correction nearing completion as
wave 2 of (5) inside. Apparently, wave c of 2 is nearing completion on
the H1 time frame. If the presumption is correct, the pair may be
expected to rise to the levels of 1960.41 – 2073.73. The level of
1764.71 is critical in this scenario, as the breakout will enable the
pair to continue declining to the levels of 1718.57 – 1668.45.
