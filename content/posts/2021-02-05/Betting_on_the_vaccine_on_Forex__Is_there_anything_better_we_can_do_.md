Euro skydives without a parachute. Review as of 05.02.2021Dmitri

Betting on the vaccine on Forex? Is there anything better we can do?

## The euro was so afraid of skydiving that it forgot to open a
parachute

Don't knock your head against the wall. Knock it against the corner -
that's more efficient. Trying to break the fundamental analysis wall,
people continued buying the euro in January as the currency had been
consolidating amid the second COVID-19 wave, lockdowns, and the growing
risks of the eurozone's economic recession. The [EURUSD][1] bulls said
that currencies didn't float in Forex - they drowned. As a result, the
pair was growing because of the dollar that drowned faster than the
euro. In the end, they had to find a corner to knock their heads at.

If nature starts taking care of itself, people will disappear. COVID-19
is the first warning. The pandemic has become the main factor in
exchange rate formation mechanisms, whereas the divergence in economic
growth and monetary policies had to step back. In 2020, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s eyed
the speed of coronavirus spread; in 2021, they are watching the pace of
vaccinations. Attempting to forecast assets' moves correctly, banks and
investment companies would turn to amateur experts in herd immunity and
study the correlation between the number of vaccinations and currency
rates to form new [trading strategies](https://www.fintechee.com/forex-trading-strategies/).

Church. Wedding ceremony. The priest asks solemnly:

> \- Do you take this woman to be your wife?

>

> The bridegroom replies:

>

> \- Can you probably suggest better candidates?

We can hardly find a better investment idea than the one based on the
pace of vaccinations in different countries. Such ideas work the best
for the pairs related to the pound sterling. The pound appears to forget
about the tense epidemiological situation, double recession risks, the
Scottish independence referendum, or the Irish border issue. It is
growing against the euro just because 14.5% of the UK population have
been vaccinated, against 2.4% in the European Union.

The guilty ones are usually those who work the most. London is trying to
redeem its poor COVID-19 management during the first wave. Brussels
appears to believe that vaccines are a mere parachute that allows it to
secure the [EURUSD][1] against falling after successful measures to
rescue the economy in mid-2020. Unfortunately, the euro was so afraid of
skydiving that it forgot to open a parachute.

The pound's case is significant, but betting on vaccines isn't always
efficient. Thus, 38% of Israel’s population is vaccinated. Still, after
rising to its record highs, the shekel got weak amid the Bank of
Israel's intention to spend a record $30 billion to drown its currency.
There's life in the old dog yet!

We shouldn't thus be eyeing the pace of vaccinations; we need to observe
the central banks' reaction closely. The former drivers in exchange rate
formation mechanisms continue working on Forex, so it would be stupid to
reject them. Even more so, because it's hard to be dumb these days: the
competition is tough!

All things must pass. The pandemic will be forgotten sooner or later,
just like the 2018-2019 trade wars. Investors will then return to the
good old drivers, such as monetary policies or economic growth rates.
That's how the market works. That's the way life goes on. Our life is
just a moment: a short moment between a midwife and a pathologist.
