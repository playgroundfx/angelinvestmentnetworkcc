Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 05.02.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

The cryptocurrency market continues following the scenarios outlined
earlier. Let us explore each cryptocurrency pair in more detail.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

The BTCUSD market is developing the upward impulse wave, namely, its
final leg. The corrective wave 4 has recently completed as a triple
zigzag [W]-[X]-[Y]-[X]-[Z]. There is unfolding the initial element of
the bullish impulse 5. The first two sub-waves of impulse 5 have
completed, wave [3] is still forming. The Bitcoin price should be rising
in the final fifth wave of the impulse wave [3] towards the level of
40109.00, which is the high made by the linking wave [X].

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 37285.00 TP 40109.00

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

The most recent section of the Ripple price chart displays the formation
of the initial element of the new bullish impulse. The upward impulse
wave 1 finished. Next, the market has started declining in the
corrective wave 2, which is unfolding as a simple zigzag [a]-[b]-[c].
Correction [b] must have completed as a double zigzag (w)-(x)-(y). The
price should be declining in the final sub-wave [c] to a level of 0.300.
One could enter sell trades in the current situation.

### Trading plan for **[XRPUSD][2]** today:

Sell 0.440, TP 0.300

## Elliott wave Ethereum analysis

The ETHUSD market continues forming the upward impulse wave. The
horizontal corrective wave 4 has recently completed as a triangle. The
market has started rising in impulse wave 5. Four legs out of five must
have completed in wave 5. Therefore, the price should be rising in the
final sub-wave [5] to a level of 1800.00. One could enter purchases in
the current situation.

### Trading plan for  **[ETHUSD][3] **today:

Buy 1632.36, TP 1800.00
