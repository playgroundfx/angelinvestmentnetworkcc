GBPUSD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 05.02.2021 –
12.02.2021Alex Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 1.3757 with a target of 1.3209 – 1.2878.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
1.3757 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 1.3850 –
1.3950.

 **Analysis:** Daily time frame: presumably, the first wave of larger
degree (1) has formed and a downside correction is starting to form as
wave (2). The fifth wave of smaller degree (v) of v of 5 finished
forming as an ending diagonal triangle on the H4 time frame. Apparently,
the first counter-trend wave (i) of i of A of (2) has formed on the H1
time frame. If this assumption is correct, the pair may be expected to
fall to 1.3209 – 1.2878 The level of 1.3757 is critical in this
scenario, as the breakout will enable the pair to continue rising to the
levels of 1.3850 – 1.3950.
