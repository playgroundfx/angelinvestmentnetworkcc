GBP/USD forecast: Pound breaks the old rulesDmitri Demidenko

## Pound Sterling forecast for today

### The [GBP/USD][1] is getting more responsive to foreign factors

The biggest Forex mystery in 2020 in the Pound Sterling. The Bank of
England officials suggest a quicker rebound of the UK GDP than it was
earlier expected, but the government bond yields are falling. Andrew
Bailey claims that the BoE was not planning negative rates at the MPC
meeting, but the money market pricing suggests such a possibility. BoE
says the £745-billion QE will finish this year, however, an increase in
the monetary stimulus signals that the central bank will continue the
monetization of government. The UK may leave the EU without a trade
deal, but the sterling is growing. The GBP price moves are puzzling, and
the first who solves the puzzle will make a big profit.

In theory, if the confidence in the positive economic outlook is getting
stronger, and the Treasury increases the issue volumes, the bond yields
should go up. Investors are selling safe havens, expecting higher
auction returns than earlier. In the UK, on the contrary, the government
bond yield has dropped so deep that it is now lower than the Japanese
bond yield.

The market hasn’t featured a strong reaction to Britain’s finance
minister Rishi Sunak's willingness to increase the financial assistance
by another £30 billion. A part of the money will be paid to the UK
workers who will return to their jobs; some funds will be spent on the
discount scheme to boost spending at restaurants, cafes, and pubs.
Britain will cut value-added tax on spending on hotels, restaurants, and
tourist attractions to boost demand for services hardest hit by the
lockdown. The threshold of the stamp duty tax on property purchases will
also rise.

Nonetheless, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s doubt that £1000 and £10 will be enough to
encourage people to return to their jobs or to go to a restaurant,
according to the 'Eat Out to Help Out' program. The GDP recovery trend
will depend on the COVID-19 situation.

### Sizes of fiscal stimulating programs

Boris Johnson, speaking with Angela Merkel, warned that the UK was ready
to leave the EU without a trade deal on Australian [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/), which is also
a negative factor for the pound bulls. Cutting off economic ties is
disastrous for business. Nonetheless, the GBP/USD is going up. What’s
the matter? I suggest that Brexit makes the sterling more responsive to
foreign factors than earlier. The GBP is much more volatile than other
G10 currencies, it is even called the “Great British Peso (GBP)”.

The sterling’s correlation with the [S&P 500][4] has increased. Earlier,
it was relevant to trade the US economic reports using the USD/JPY, but
now, it seems to be more beneficial to buy or sell the [GBP/USD][1]. The
sterling now depends on foreign factors, so, the growth of the global
risk appetite is a stronger driver than Brexit or the UK economic
weakness. I think the pound can reach $1.3 only if there positive [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/)
about Brexit and COVID-19 vaccine. Therefore, it makes sense to
gradually exit longs entered at levels $1.2535 and $1.235 as the
sterling is moving towards $1.272.
