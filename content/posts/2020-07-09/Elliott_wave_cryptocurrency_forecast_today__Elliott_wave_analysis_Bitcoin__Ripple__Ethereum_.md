###  **Elliott wave[BTCUSD][1] analysis**

![LiteForex: Elliott wave cryptocurrency forecast today. Elliott wave
analysis Bitcoin, Ripple, Ethereum.][2]

The BTCUSD market has completed the long-term corrective wave [4] as a
double three. There is likely to be developing a new uptrend. There
should have completed the impulse wave (1) and the upward corrective
wave (2). Presumably, the price should continue rising to a level above
9799. This is the previous high made by the zigzag-shaped linking wave
X.

There is now forming the upward impulse wave. There have completed a
small bullish impulse 1 and the down corrective wave 2, which is a
double zigzag [w]-[x]-[y]. There is developing the third wave, with the
smaller impulse wave [3] developing inside. In the near future, there
should be a corrective movement in the zigzag-shaped wave (4). Next, the
market should be rising in the final wave (5) of [3].

###  **Elliott wave[ETHUSD][5] analysis**

 **![LiteForex: Elliott wave cryptocurrency forecast today. Elliott wave
analysis Bitcoin, Ripple, Ethereum.][6]**

In the upward impulse wave of larger degree that is composed of five
sub-waves (1)-(2)-(3)-(4)-(5), the final wave (5) is developing as an
impulse [1]-[2]-[3]-[4]-[5]. The first two sub-waves of this impulse
look complete, and the market is forming the third wave now. In the next
few weeks, the market is likely to complete impulse [3], next, the price
should decline a little in the corrective wave [4]. An approximate
trajectory of the ETH future price movement is outlined in the chart.
