EUR/USD forecast: Euro has caught a tail-windDmitri Demidenko

## Fundamental Euro forecast for today

### The [EUR/USD][1] bulls are supported by good [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) from Asia and the
stabilization of European financial markets.

For a long time, the entire financial world has been following the US,
depending on the US stock indexes. However, the economic situation in
the US is like “hope for the better but prepare for the worse”, and
other countries are now coming in the game. The continuous growth of the
Chinese stocks over the last seven days and the yuan’s rise to its four-
month highs indicate the strength of China’s economy, which might become
the world’s financial leader in the future. At the beginning of July,
the Shanghai Composite, not the [S&P 500][2], is the best indicator of
the global risk appetite, the US stock index is following the Chinese
and not vice versa.

When they were moving in opposite directions in 2018-2019, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s saw
this as a signal that the US was winning the trade war. Donald Trump
could afford to use a carrot-and-stick [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) to force China to sign the
trade deal profitable for the US. Now, Washington can only use minor
threats, including hints at bans on TikTok or the entry of Chinese
students into the USA, as well as the decision to unpeg the Hong Kong
dollar to the US dollar, which would create problems for foreigners
working with the Chinese markets. Beijing, which didn’t respond to the
US attacks earlier, now makes loud statements that the current US
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), based on strategic misjudgments that lack factual evidence, is a
paranoia.

China is now more confident, gaining strength also because the Shanghai
Composite is steadily growing, and Donald Trump’s approval ratings are
falling. According to Goldman Sachs, the probabilities that Joe Biden
will capture the White House, and Democrats will gain control of the
Senate, are 43% and 62%, up from 30% and 61% in February. If Trump hints
at the escalation of the US-China trade war under the current
conditions, the [S&P 500][2] drop will ruin his plans for re-election.
The US stock index is now following its China’s peer, and experts say
the S&P 500 is not responsive to the deterioration of the
epidemiological situation in the USA. They explain it by the Fed’s huge
monetary stimulus that has pressed the Treasury yields down. However,
the US stock market rose when the Treasury yields were growing. This
signals that the [S&P 500][2] reacts to the US economic state, not to
the low interest rates.

A tail-wind from Asia followed by growth of the risk appetite is a
reason to sell safe havens, including the US dollar. The [EUR/USD][1]
has hit its monthly highs also because of Angela Merkel's statement.
Germany's chancellor says the eurozone has seen “huge economic upheaval”
and the governments cannot afford to “waste any time” discussing the
plans to protect the euro-area economy. Merkel underlined the need to
swiftly adopt the French-German €750-billion recovery plan. The decline
in the yield spread between the bonds of the euro-area peripheral
countries and Germany to the lowest levels since March signals that the
financial stress has eased.

Euro looks strong, it should try to break out the resistances at $1.1385
and $1.1405. If the resistances are broken out, the bulls will go ahead,
and the price will continue rising.
