Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 07.07.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

The cryptocurrency pairs should soon finish leading diagonals and start
declining in corrective waves.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

The upward wave (A) continues developing as a leading diagonal composed
of sub-waves 1-2-3-4-5. There should be developing the final wave of the
diagonal, the upward wave 5. Wave 5 looks like an ending diagonal, as
wave [4] finished further than wave [1]. The price should be moving in
wave [5] composed of sub-waves (3)-(4)-(5) to a level of 38100.00.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 34692.50, TP 38100.00

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

The XRPUSD market is developing the upward wave A as a leading diagonal.
There have completed sub-waves 1]-[2]-[3]-[4]. There is unfolding the
final sub-wave [5] as a five-wave impulse (1)-(2)-(3)-(4)-(5).
Therefore, the price should be rising in waves (3)-(4)-(5) to a level of
0.760. One could enter long trades in the current situation.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] **** today:

Buy 0.671, TP 0.760

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

There must be forming the initial part of the bullish simple zigzag
[A]-[B]-[C]. Wave [A] is likely to be a leading diagonal. There have
completed the first four parts. There should be forming the final wave
of the diagonal, sub-wave (5). The price could be rising to a level of
2555.00, marked by a short correction 2. One could enter buy trades in
the current situation.
