Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 07.07.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

Yesterday, the short-term oil trend reversed down.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

Yesterday, the short-term oil trend reversed down. As a result, the
Intermediary Zone 73.74 - 73.48 was broken out. The new target for sales
for the rest of the week is the lower Target Zone 71.09 - 70.56.

It is reasonable to sell oil on correction in the zone between the
Additional Zone and Intermediary Zone. This zone is located between
levels 73.76 - 75.35.

Oil purchases according to the methodology are not yet possible.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

Sell from the zone of 73.76 - 75.35. TakeProfit: Target Zone 71.09 -
70.56. StopLoss: 75.88.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

Yesterday, the gold price was being corrected down. As part of the
correction, the Intermediary Zone 1792 - 1790 was reached. Today look
for new purchases within the short-term uptrend with the target in the
Gold Zone 1820 - 1818.

The “1-2-3” or “false breakout” can serve as a pattern.

A breakout of the Intermediary Zone and the price consolidation below
are required for gold sales and trend reversal down. In this case, it is
reasonable to open short trades with a target in the lower Target Zone
1770 - 1765.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

Buy according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 1784 - 1781.
TakeProfit: Gold Zone 1820 - 1818. StopLoss: according to the pattern
rules.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

Yesterday, the short-term euro downtrend continued. As a result, the
July 2 low was updated, and the resistance zone 1.1904 - 1.1878 yielded
profits.

Now the price is correcting. Additional Zone 1.1855 - 1.1851 can serve
as a probable target of correction. After testing this resistance, it is
reasonable again to start looking for sales according to the pattern
with the target at the day's low and the Target Zone 1.1800 - 1.1781.

If the Additional Zone is broken out upside, then it can be assumed that
buyers wish to test the border of the downtrend 1.1890.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

Sell according to the pattern in Additional Zone 1.1855 - 1.1851.
TakeProfit: 1.1808, Target Zone 1.1800 - 1.1781. StopLoss: according to
the pattern rules.
