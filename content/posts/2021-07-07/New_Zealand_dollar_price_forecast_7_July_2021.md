Kiwi to be first to deal with Pandexit. Forecast as of 07.07.2021Dmitri
Demidenko

Adjustment of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) is a key driver of exchange rate formation
in Forex. In 2018-2019, it lost its importance due to trade wars, and in
2020 it becomes relevant again due to a pandemic. What does this mean
for [AUDNZD][1] and [NZDJPY][2]? Let us discuss the Forex outlook and
make up a trading plan

## Quarterly New Zealand dollar fundamental forecast

If in 2014 the financial markets were agitated by Scoexit, in 2016 it
was Brexit, then in 2021 it is Pandexit. Seven years ago, Scotland tried
to leave the UK, two years later, the UK took the first step towards
parting with the European Union. Today, central banks, confident that
emergency stimulus programs should end with the pandemic, are trying to
slowly abandon the ultra-easy monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).

Investors are quite justified in compiling a list of G10 regulators-
issuers who are ready to normalize monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). Its adjustment has
[historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/)ly served as the main driver of Forex pricing, although in
2018-2019 it was replaced by trade wars, and in 2020 by the coronavirus.
The victory over the pandemic is approaching, so it is time to return to
the previous key factors affecting exchange rates.

The first place in the list is taken by Norges Bank, which unequivocally
hints at a rate hike in the second half of this year. The third and
fourth are occupied by the Bank of Canada and the Fed. The Reserve Bank
of New Zealand moved up to second place after the release of strong
statistics on business confidence. A poll by the Economic Research
Institute showed a sharp shift in corporate sentiment in the second
quarter. In January-March, net pessimism about the general business
conditions was 7%, then in April-June, it was replaced by pure optimism
of 13%. As a result, BNZ and ASB Bank officials started talking about
the fact that the cash rate could be increased as early as November, and
the NZD reacted with a rapid growth against major world currencies.

Strong business confidence data allowed the derivatives market to
increase the chances of the first act of monetary restriction from 50%
to 90% at the November RBNZ meeting, the last in 2021. Investors believe
that by the end of 2022 rates will return to the pre-pandemic level of
1%. Wellington will be one of the first to deal with Pandexit, which is
a strong argument in favor of buying the New Zealand dollar.

Effective fight against COVID-19, New Zealand's booming economy and a
very hot real estate market create prerequisites for the start of
monetary normalization. New Zealand has the biggest house bubble,
according to Bloomberg research.

### Quarterly [AUDNZD][1] and [NZDJPY][2] trading plan

Only a deterioration of the global risk appetite prevented the NZD
buyers from developing an advantage. The [NZDUSD][3] and [NZDJPY][2]
pairs were unstable amid falling Asian stock indices. However, I don’t
think there will be a major correction in the stock market in the near
future, which is unfavorable for such risky monetary units as the NZD. I
believe that it is reasonable to wait for a divergence in monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) and [continue to sell][4][AUDNZD][1] with targets at 1.062 and
1.054, as well as buy [NZDJPY][2] with targets at 79.5 and 80.6.
