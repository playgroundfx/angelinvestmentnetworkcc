Aussie: from bad to worse. Forecast as of 22.09.2021Dmitri Demidenko

The Australian economy is to face a downturn amid new lockdowns and a
collapse in iron ore prices. Furthermore, the [AUDUSD][1] bulls are set
back by the problems delivered by the Fed and China. Let us discuss the
forex outlooks and make up a trading plan.

## Monthly Australian dollar fundamental forecast

The problems currently challenging Australia's economy do not allow the
[AUDUSD][1] bulls to reverse the downtrend. The world's stock indexes
are down, the topic of trade wars is again hot, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s worry about
the risks of China's Evergrande default. Therefore, the AUDUSD is
naturally down to the targets at 0.728 and 0.722, defined in the
[previous analytics][2], and could fall deeper.

The main headwinds for the Aussie come not from the US, where the Fed is
to signal the start of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) normalization, but from Asia.
Pressure from China and the risks of a slowdown in its economy send the
Australian dollar down as a proxy for the Chinese economy.

Australia is torn between two partners. The US is Australia's main
military partner, and China is its main trade partner. In response to
the creation of Aukus by Washington, Canberra, and London, Beijing asks
for the Trans-Pacific Partnership and declares that it seeks economic
cooperation, unlike the USA and Australia, which insist on war and
destruction. Therefore, Australia's economy seems to be in trouble.

A new round of trade wars between the USA and China and between China
and Australia is not what the Australian economy will benefit from.
Australia's growth is to face a downturn amid new lockdowns and a drop
in commodity prices, including iron ore. The first sign of a recession
was the drop in Australian employment by 146,000 in August against the
forecast of -90,000.

Potential default by Evergrande only worsens the situation. The largest
developer in China missed payments to its creditors on September 20 but
promised to pay debts on bonds on the 23rd. Markets reacted with growth,
including growth in AUDUSD, but the coupons may not be redeemed. MUFG
believes that [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s may find themselves jumping out of the frying
pan into the fire.

China's real estate sector accounts for about 29% of GDP, and Beijing
now faces the fallout of the impact of China's financial system on
developers, tech, and other companies. This gives the BofA reason to
downgrade its forecasts for China's growth from 8.3% to 8% in 2021 and
from 6.2% to 5.3% in 2022. The main reasons are the outbreak of
COVID-19, tight credit control over investments in infrastructure and
the real estate sector, as well as decarbonization policies that press
down the production of commodities. According to Market Securities,
Chinese GDP will slow down sharply (+ 0.3% Q-o-Q) in the third quarter,
significantly lower than Bloomberg experts' median estimate at + 1.1%.

### Monthly [AUDUSD][1] trading plan

Thus, even if the Fed does not change its rate forecasts at its
September meeting and does not announce the tapering of the QE, the
[AUDUSD][1] upward correction will be temporary. It is relevant to sell
the pair. The targets at [0.728 and 0.722][2] have been reached; the
next downside target is 0.714.
