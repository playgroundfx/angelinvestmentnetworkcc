Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 22.09.21Alex Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

The short-term trend for gold has changed to an uptrend because the
Intermediary Zone 1765 - 1762 was broken out.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

Yesterday, the priority model of shorting in the correction in Addtional
Zone 71.07 - 70.94 with the target at the minimum of September 20 worked
out. After the minimum of September 20 was updated, the price could not
consolidate below the Intermediary Zone 70.32 - 70.07. The Intermediary
Zone is the key support level of the trend. It has been held, therefore
the trend remains upward.

The oil price is growing and breaking through the resistance level of
71.20. When the price consolidates above the level, a “false breakout”
pattern will appear. In this case, consider buying oil with a target at
72.67.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

Buy according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 70.32 - 70.07.
TakeProfit: 72.67. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

The short-term trend for gold has changed to an uptrend because the
Intermediary Zone 1765 - 1762 was broken out. Now the price is
approaching the first target of the new trend — Target Zone 1787 - 1783.
After the Target Zone is tested, watch the market.

If buyers manage to consolidate above the Target Zone, then the rally is
likely to continue, targeting the Gold Zone 1806-1804.

If the Target Zone is held, then the price will go into correction. A
correction for traders is a chance to consider new longs at favourable
prices with a target in the area of the day's high.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

Buy according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 1761 - 1759.
TakeProfit: Target Zone 1787 - 1783. StopLoss: according to the pattern
rules.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

A short-term downtrend continues for the euro. Now bears are trying to
break through the Target Zone 1.1733 - 1.1715. If they manage to do it,
the next sales target will be the Gold Zone 1.1645 - 1.1636.

It is better to transfer shorts opened in the Additional Zone 1.1748 -
1.1744 to the breakeven point — there is a risk of price growth and the
Additional Zone breaking out to the upside. If this happens, the price
can be expected to move to the area of the Intermediary Zone 1.1797 -
1.1788. The Intermediary Zone is the border of the short-term downtrend.
Look for the euro shorts in this zone.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

  1. Hold shorts opened in Additional Zone 1.1748 - 1.1744. TakeProfit: 1.1701. StopLoss: breakeven point.

  2. Sell according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 1.1797 - 1.1788. TakeProfit: 1.1701. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.
