Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 22.09.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

The cryptocurrency pairs covered in the market are forming the middle
legs of the bearish impulses. Therefore, [cryptocurrency price](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/cryptocurrency-price/)s will be
falling over the next few days.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

The BTCUSD pair is forming the initial part of the large impulse wave.
Impulse 1 is complete, correction 2 has also completed, it has a complex
structure of triple zigzag. The market is going down in impulse 3. The
price should soon reach a level of 37233.00 and continue falling lower.
I recommend selling the pair in the current situation.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Sell 41910.01, TP 37233.00

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

After the linking wave (X) completed, there has started a new bearish
trend. There should be forming a descending impulse wave composed of
sub-waves 1-2-3-4-5. Impulse 1 and correction 2, composed of sub-waves
[W]-[X]-[Y], have finished. There is unfolding the third sub-waves,
namely, its middle leg, impulse [3]. An approximate trajectory of the
Ripple future price movement is outlined in the chart. The price should
be declining in sub-wave (3) to a level of 0.805.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] **** today:

Sell 0.906, TP 0.805

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

Corrective wave B completed in early September. Next, the price started
declining in the new impulse down wave. Sub-waves 1 and 2 have
completed, and impulse wave 3 is currently developing. The first two
sub-waves of a smaller degree have finished in wave 3, so the market
will continue falling in sub-waves [3]-[4]-[5], as outlined in the
chart. Wave [3] should finish at a level of around 2520.00; next,
following a short correction [4], the market will continue declining in
the final sub-wave [5].

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Sell 2843.08, TP 2520.00
