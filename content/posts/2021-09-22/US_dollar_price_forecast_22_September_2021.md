Dollar is to wake up Forex. Forecast as of 22.09.2021Dmitri Demidenko

The stock market is rising, while Forex is trading flat. It is clear
what [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s prefer currently. But things could radically change
already in September. Let us discuss the Forex outlook and make up a
[EURUSD][1] trading plan.

## Monthly US dollar fundamental forecast

While the synchronization of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) by the world's leading
central banks has put the international currency market to sleep, the
September Fed meeting may wake it up. Advanced economies' regulators
have responded similarly to the crisis and intend to slowly normalize
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) as economies recover. Until recently, no one expected
the Fed to raise the federal funds rate earlier than 2023 and the ECB -
earlier than 2024. As a result, [EURUSD][1] in 2021 marks the narrowest
trading range in [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/), and the average trading volume in foreign
exchange futures and [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/), according to the CME data, dropped to its
lowest level since 2009. Is it time to wake up?

### Dynamics of EURUSD trading ranges

When stocks are rising, and currency pairs are trading flat in narrow
ranges, it is clear what [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s prefer. Interest in Forex should
increase when central banks move in different directions. It is the
divergence in monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) that gives rise to the most violent
trends. Until June, there was no sign of discrepancy.

At its June meeting, the Fed tried to encourage Forex traders by sending
a signal of a possible rate hike as early as in 2022. Then, 7 out of 18
FOMC officials voted for this scenario. If at least two more join them,
half of the Open Market Committee will predict that the first act of
monetary restriction will take place as early as next year. Along with
the ECB's reluctance to change interest rates until at least 2024,
divergence will become a reality. Forex must wake up!

### June FOMC forecasts for federal funds rate

Yes, one could argue that the dot plot is for informational purposes and
is not a guide to making decisions, but the verdict is made by people.
And suppose FOMC officials are more worried that the new wave of
COVID-19 and its associated supply chain disruption will make high
inflation a long-term phenomenon. In that case, they will certainly want
to raise the interest rate sooner rather than later.

By far, the Fed's rate forecast is the biggest mystery facing financial
markets. Even the announcement of the QE tapering or its absence will
note come as a surprise to [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s. Most likely, the Fed will note the
economic progress in achieving its dual target and announce that this
circumstance creates the basis for a reduction in asset purchases under
the QE already in 2021. Another matter is the dot plot...

The shift of the potential rate hike from 2023 to 2022 could actually
hurt the credibility of Jerome Powell, who previously spoke of no link
between the end of the quantitative easing program and the start of a
federal funds rate hike. It is not preferable for a man preparing for
re-election as Fed chairman.

### Monthly [EURUSD][2] trading plan

I believe a change in the FOMC median forecast for the federal funds
rate will suggest the [EURUSD][1] downtrend is stable. Of course, the
euro could start rising at first if Jerome Powell manages to reassure
the markets. Nonetheless, the most likely scenario suggests that it
should be relevant to sell the pair with targets at 1.168 and 1.156.
