Gold doesn't ask for trouble. Forecast as of 28.07.2021Dmitri Demidenko

Gold in 2021 breaks stereotypes. Its price is falling in response to
accelerating inflation, declining real Treasury yields and growing risks
of a global economy's slowdown. Let us discuss the Forex outlook and
make up a gold trading plan

## Fundamental gold price forecast for today

Unlike the US dollar, which decided to collapse without waiting for the
Fed's decision, gold managed to stay within the trading range of
$1793-1813 per ounce. The nerves of gold traders turned out to be much
stronger than those of their counterparts from the foreign exchange
market, but it is all due to the chaos that surrounds gold in 2021. Gold
continues to break existing stereotypes, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s simply don’t know
what to do and prefer not to ask for trouble.

It is clearly stated in any textbook on fundamental analysis that the
gold serves as a hedging tool against inflation, precious metal's price
usually rises against the background of falling real yields of US
Treasuries. The same textbooks say that the growth of uncertainty and
the threat of the global economy's slowdown, as a rule, help [XAUUSD][1]
bulls. What is the current situation? US consumer prices have
accelerated to a multi-year high of 5.4%, but gold is falling. US debt
rates have hit historic lows in real [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/), but gold is falling.
Investors fear that the global economy will shift from reflation to
stagflation, a combination of high inflation and slow GDP expansion, but
gold is falling. Paradox?

### Dynamics of the Treasuries real yield

Typically, falling Treasury yields are forcing pension funds, insurance
companies and other institutional [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s to look for alternatives in
the form of equity securities or gold. In 2021, the beforementioned
institutions are giving preference to stock indices. Even with the
recent decline, the stock market resembles a jet that took off and is
coming out of an air pocket, but is still struggling to find a suitable
cruising altitude. The [S&P 500][2] falls are immediately bought out.
How can gold, which violates the principles of fundamental analysis,
compete with it?

In my opinion, gold's dependence on inflation is fundamentally wrong.
For [XAUUSD][1], it is not inflation itself that matters, but what the
Fed officials think about its prospects. Prior to the June FOMC meeting,
gold felt very confident amid the Fed's patience with accelerating
consumer prices. Since then, the gold price has plunged by 7% as the
Fed's view has changed. Will it change again, or will the FOMC follow
its own way, which does not exclude an increase in the federal funds
rate in 2022? The fate of gold will depend on the answer to this
question.

I do not think that because of the Delta, the US will begin to impose
new restrictions. The recovery of the US economy is reaching a peak,
which implies the normalization of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), which, in turn, will
support the US dollar. In Jackson Hole in August, Jerome Powell is
likely to announce the tapering of QE, while the return of the labor
market to pre-pandemic levels and high inflation will create
preconditions for raising rates in 2022.

### Gold trading plan for today

These conditions will continue to put pressure on gold in the medium
term. In the short term, the breakout of the upper border of the trading
range of $1793-1813 per ounce may become the reason for the opening of
long trades. On the contrary, gold price decline below the support at
$1,793 serves as a sell signal.
