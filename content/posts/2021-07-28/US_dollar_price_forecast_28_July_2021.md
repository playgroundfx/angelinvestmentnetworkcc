Dollar had a false start. Forecast as of 28.07.2021Dmitri Demidenko

The Fed went back to its passive approach, and the USD crashed. Some
speculators holding longs broke down. The [EURUSD][1] is up, but will
the growth be sustained. Let us discuss the Forex outlook and make up a
trading plan.

## Fundamental US dollar forecast today

The market expects the Fed to be patient but is unwilling to be patient
itself. The [EURUSD][1] broke out the consolidation range of
1.1755-1.1825 upside. The Dollar bulls were scared by the Fed’s possible
return to the former passive approach amid the Delta spread and a series
of the US disappointing economic data. They didn’t want to wait for the
outcomes of the FOMC July meeting. The dollar bears are going ahead. Let
us see what will happen next.

For almost six months since the beginning of 2021, the Fed had remained
passive, unwilling to respond to the US inflation growth, and the USD
was weakening. In mid-June, the US central bank shifted to a more
hawkish tone, and speculators started exiting the dollar shorts. If the
Fed goes back to its former wait-and-see approach, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s will have
to resume the former strategies, setting back the [EURUSD][1] bears. The
matter is what the Fed is going to do.

The Fed seems to have a number of reasons to put off monetary
tightening. The number of people infected with COVID-19 in the United
States is growing, and the vaccination rate is seriously slowing down.
America is no longer the leader: at the current speed of the vaccine
campaign, 75% of its population will be vaccinated in 8-9 months. For
comparison, the EU will need only 2 months to reach herd immunity.
Furthermore, inflation expectations are down, and [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are
seriously worried that the US economy peaked in the second quarter and
is to turn down next.

In my opinion, there are not enough arguments. First, the US economy is
still very strong. Durable goods orders have been on the rise for 13 of
the past 14 months, the housing prices have hit a new record, and
consumer confidence has been up to a new pandemic peak. The IMF raised
its forecast for the US GDP for 2021 from 6.4% to 7% while maintaining
estimates for the economies of Germany and France at the same level. The
economic expectations for Spain were revised down, and the forecasts for
Italy were improved.

### Change in IMF forecasts for 2021

The International Monetary Fund said the pandemic continues to pose a
major risk to the global economy, and the access to vaccines has become
a border along which the global GDP recovery is splitting into two
blocks. As a result, the forecast for advanced economies was raised from
5.1% to 5.6%; for emerging markets, the growth expectations were reduced
from 6.7% to 6.3%. Thus, the uneven recovery of the global economy and
the US exclusivity are the bullish drivers for the greenback.

Furthermore, the Fed will hardly change its [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) stance so frequently.
It would be strange if the Fed, after hinting in June at a rate hike in
2022, returns to its passive attitude in July and then again sounds
hawkish in the autumn. In my opinion, the Fed will remain optimistic but
will not ignore the risks associated with the Delta. The US central bank
acts strictly according to plan, and now, this plan provides for scaling
back the QE.

### [EURUSD][1] trading plan today

I suppose the [EURUSD][1] surge ahead of the results of the FOMC meeting
looks like a false start. Traders should trade the facts. If the euro
doesn’t consolidate above $1.1825 after Jerome Powell’s press
conference, it will be relevant to sell.
