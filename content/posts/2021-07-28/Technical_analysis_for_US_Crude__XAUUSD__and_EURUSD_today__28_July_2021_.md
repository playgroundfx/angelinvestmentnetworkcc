Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 28.07.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

Gold is trading in the sideways trend between the levels of 1810 and
1795.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

There has been formed an accumulation zone in the oil price chart
between the levels of 72.10 and 70.80. The price will reach the Gold
Zone 73.19 - 72.92 after a breakout of the resistance level of 72.10.
The breakout of the support level 70.80 will lead to a deep correction
to the Intermediary Zone 69.39 - 69.12.

Within the day, it is possible to enter trades from the borders of the
range with a target at the opposite border.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

Sell from the level of 72.10. TakeProfit: 70.80. StopLoss: 72.70.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

Gold is trading in the sideways trend between the levels of 1810 and
1795. Within the sideways trend, it is recommended to enter trades at
the borders of the range with a target at the opposite border. Since the
price is now approaching the upper border of the sideways trend and is
testing the Additional Zone 1806 - 1804, it is profitable to look for
sales with the target at level 1795 and the Intermediary Zone 1789 -
1786.

The alternative scenario suggests a breakout of the Additional Zone 1806
- 1804 and price consolidation above. In this case, it will be possible
to consider purchases with a target in the Intermediary Zone 1818 -
1816.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

Sell according to the pattern in the zone of 1806 - 1800. TakeProfit:
Intermediary Zone 1789 - 1786. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

A trading recommendation to buy the euro in the zone of 1.1803 - 1.1769
yielded profits. The July 26 (1st target) local high was updated, and
the price approached the Intermediary Zone 1.1851 - 1.1842 as close as
possible. So close that it should be considered that the area has been
tested.

Now the price is reacting to strong resistance and goes into correction
to an intraday uptrend. The target of the correction is the test of the
Additional Zone 1.1797 - 1.1792. Look again for the euro purchases in
the beforementioned AZ according to the pattern in order to update
yesterday's high.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

Buy according to the pattern in Additional Zone 1.1797 - 1.1792.
TakeProfit: 1.1840. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.
