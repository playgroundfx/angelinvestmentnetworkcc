Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 28.07.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

Three cryptocurrency pairs covered in the article must be rising in
value. Let study the chart structure of each pair in more detail.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

The BTCUSD market continues forming the upward wave (Y) that should
conclude the upward double zigzag (W)-(X)-(Y). The (Y) wave should be
unfolding as a standard zigzag A-B-C, where the first two sub-waves have
completed. The market should continue rising the final sub-waves [4] and
[5] to a level of 40057.36, where the final impulse wave C should
finish. At this level, wave (Y) will be 138.2% of wave (W). One could
consider purchases in the current situation.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 39716.00, TP 40057.00

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

The XRPUSD market continues forming the impulse upwave C, which is an
element of the horizontal pattern, flat A-B-C. There is developing the
final leg of the C impulse, sub-wave [5]. Wave [5] is unfolding as an
ending diagonal (1)-(2)-(3)-(4)-(5). The Ripple should rise in wave (5)
to a level higher than that marked by wave (3), that is, above level
0.677. One could open buy positions under the current conditions.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] **** today:

Buy 0.641, TP 0.677

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

The ETHUSD market is forming the final leg of the upward impulse [C].
The [C] wave is the final leg in the zigzag-shaped correction B of a
larger degree. Sub-waves (1)-(2)-(3)-(4) completed within wave [C], and
the final leg (5) is still developing. The Ethereum price should go up
to a level of 2425.00, where sub-waves [A] and [C] will be equal. It is
still relevant to enter buy trades with a target at 2425.00.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Buy 2296.16, TP 2425.00
