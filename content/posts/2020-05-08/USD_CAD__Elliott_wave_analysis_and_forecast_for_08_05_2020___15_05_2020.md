USD/CAD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 08/05/2020 –
15/05/2020Alex Geuta

## [USD/CAD][1] remains likely to fall. Estimated pivot point is at a
level of 1.4165.

 **Main scenario:** Consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 1.4165 with a target of 1.3730 – 1.3598.

 **Alternative scenario:** ****breakout and consolidation above the
level of 1.4165 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of
1.4562 – 1.4671.

 **Analysis:** On the D1 time frame, supposedly, a descending correction
finished developing in the form of second wave of larger degree (2), and
wave (3) started forming. Supposedly, the first counter-trend wave of
smaller degree 1 of (3) formed and a descending correction is developing
in the form of wave 2 of (3) on the H4 time frame. Apparently, on the H1
time frame wave b of 2 finished developing and wave c of 2 is forming,
with wave (iii) of c of 2 developing inside. If the presumption is
correct, the pair will continue to drop to the levels of 1.3730 –
1.3598. The level of 1.4165 is critical in this scenario as the breakout
will enable the pair to continue rising to the levels of 1.4562 –
1.4671.
