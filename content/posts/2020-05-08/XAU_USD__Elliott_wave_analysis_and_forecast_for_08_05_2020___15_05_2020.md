XAU/USD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 08/05/2020 –
15/05/2020Alex Geuta

## The pair [XAU/USD][1] remains likely to fall. Estimated pivot point
is at a level of 1747.08.

 **Main scenario:** consider short positions from corrections below the
level of  1747.08 with a target of 1561.72 – 1450.00.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
1747.08 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 1800.00
– 1850.00.

 **Analysis:** Supposedly, an ascending correction of larger degree
finished developing in the form of wave (B) on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame,
with wave С of (B) formed within. Apparently, the fifth wave v of C
finished developing on the H4 time frame and wave i of 1 of (C) started
forming. The first wave of junior level (i) of i of 1 has formed and a
local correction is nearing completion in the form of wave (ii) of i on
the H1 time frame. If the presumption is correct, the price will
continue falling to the levels of 1561.72 – 1450.00. The level of
1747.08 is critical in this scenario as the breakout will enable the
pair to continue growing to the levels of 1800.00 – 1850.00.
