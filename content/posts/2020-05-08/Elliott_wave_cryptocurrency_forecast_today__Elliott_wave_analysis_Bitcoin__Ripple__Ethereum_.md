The BTCUSD market is likely to have completed the long-term corrective
wave B that is a triple zigzag, which has been forming for almost two
months. The market is now turning down, and the price should soon start
declining in the new downtrend. That is, the final impulse wave C should
be developing in the next few weeks.

The upward corrective wave B finished as a triple zigzag
[W]-[X]-[Y]-[X]-[Z]. There is developing the bear impulse wave, namely,
its initial phase. The down impulse [1] has finished, as well as the
sideways correction [2] that is a double three. There is now developing
the third wave, with two small sub-waves (1) and (2) completed inside.
Therefore, the price should continue declining in the third wave for
some time.
