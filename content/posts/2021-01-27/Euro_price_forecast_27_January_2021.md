Dollar will spoil the party. Forecast for 27.01.2021Dmitri Demidenko

The FOMC's first meeting in 2021 is an important event for financial
markets. However, the Fed’s meeting will hardly change [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s’
sentiment. Let us discuss the Forex outlook and make up a [EURUSD][1]
trading plan.

## Fundamental US dollar forecast for today

Jerome Powell is trying to convince the financial markets that the Fed
will not take away the punch bowl just when the party gets going.
However, different vaccination paces and the growth-gap between the US
and euro-area economies suggest that the [EURUSD][1] bulls should not
expect the euro rally to be as fast as it was in November-December. The
IMF expects the US and China’s economies to exceed the forecasts made
for 2022 before the pandemic by 1.5% by the end of next year. Some
European economies will only be able to recover to pre-crisis levels in
2023.

In 1955,  William McChesney Martin, then chairman of the US Federal
Reserve,  noted that the central bank’s attempt to raise interest rates
too early to slow down inflation looks like taking away the punch bowl
just when the party gets going. Jerome Powell does not want to repeat
the mistakes of the former Fed’s chairs. For example, Ben Bernanke
crashed financial markets in 2013, saying that it was the right time to
start tapering the bond purchases. In early January, several FOMC
officials talked about pulling back on the asset purchase program, which
supported the US dollar. Powell aims now to dissuade [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s from this
idea.

However, 37% of Bloomberg experts believe that the Fed should start
winding down the QE as early as 2021. Such expectations are one of the
key drivers of the greenback strengthening.

Furthermore, the US dollar has more benefits. They are a potential
escalation of the US-China trade battle, divergence in the paces of
vaccination and economic recovery in the US and the euro area. Although
the upward revising of the forecasts for the global GDP in 2020 from
-4.4% to -3.5% and in 2021 from +5.2% to 5.5% by the IMF is good [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/)
for the [EURUSD][1] bulls, it is necessary to understand what will drive
the global economy. The leaders should be the USA and China, while the
euro-area economies should be lagging behind.

I do not believe the above factors are the ultimate benefits for the
greenback. The US dollar should benefit from the US-China battle
escalation, but the greenback could weaken if the global GDP rebounds
because of its safe-haven status. Such a scenario is more likely to work
out in the medium term. In the short run, the [EURUSD][1] trend depends
on the vaccination speed.

With this regard, the situation suggests the euro should be corrected
down. Pfizer said it is ready to ship 200 million doses to the US by the
end of May, two months earlier than initially estimated. On the
contrary, the vaccine's provision to the European Union is being delayed
due to problems with the manufacturer's plant in Belgium. AstraZeneca
said it would ship substantially fewer doses to Europe than it had
promised.

### [EURUSD][1] trading plan for today

I believe Jerome Powell’s dovish stance could push the [EURUSD][1] up
above the bottom of figure 22. However, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s should soon realize
that there won’t be such a rally as it was in November-December and
start selling the euro. It will be relevant to enter short-term sell
trades if the price fails to test the resistances at 1.221 and 1.2245.
