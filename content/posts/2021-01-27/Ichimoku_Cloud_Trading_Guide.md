Ichimoku Cloud Indicator in Forex ExplainedAlex Rodionov

Today, I will explain [how to](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-trading-how-to/) use the [Ichimoku Kinko Hyo](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/ichimoku-kinko-hyo.html) indicator, or
Ichimoku (Ichi Cloud) for short. I will cover in detail how the Ichimoku
Kinko Hyo mt4 works and what the Ichimoku trading system. I will also
write about the best [Ichimoku Kinko Hyo](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/ichimoku-kinko-hyo.html) settings. You will learn [how to](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-trading-how-to/)
read Ichimoku signals and [how to](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-trading-how-to/) trade Ichimoku cloud. And finally, I
will explain the Japanese candlestick signals in the Forex Ichimoku
trading system.

The article covers the following subjects:

## What is [Ichimoku Kinko Hyo](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/ichimoku-kinko-hyo.html): Definition and History

The [Ichimoku Kinko Hyo](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/ichimoku-kinko-hyo.html), or Ichimoku for short, is a standard trend
indicator included in the list of built-in indicators of the Meta Trader
and other trading platforms.

Forex Ichimoku trading system combines three technical tools in a single
[Ichimoku Kinko Hyo](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/ichimoku-kinko-hyo.html) (IKH) indicator to trade Forex.

[Ichimoku Kinko Hyo](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/ichimoku-kinko-hyo.html) is used to gauge the future price momentum and to
determine the future support and resistance zones to make profitable
trades.

According to ichimoku [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/), the term [Ichimoku Kinko Hyo](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/ichimoku-kinko-hyo.html) is Asian,
namely, Japanese. Ichimoku translates to “a glance”, Kinko means
“equilibrium”, while Hyo is Japanese for “chart”. Altogether, Ichimoku
Kinko Hyo translates to “a glance at a chart in equilibrium”.

This all-in-one technical indicator Ichimoku cloud is composed of five
lines, which are called tenkan-sen, kijun-sen, senkou span A, senkou
span B and chikou span.

Ichimoku is a Japanese forex analysis tool, which allows traders to
analyze charts faster and more accurately.

Using the Ichimoku trading system download is quite common in the forex
market, especially at the Asian trade sessions.

The Ichimoku developer,  Goichi Hosoda, designed the tool to analyze the
Japanese stock market. Hosoda utilized [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) and weekly charts in the
analysis. His disciples have been following this rule for the Ichimoku
trading so far. The Ichi cloud is much less effective in shorter
timeframes, because all indicator instruments and their periods were
initially tied to the number of working days in a month. If you plan to
use Ichimoku on smaller timeframes, you will need to change its default
settings and experiment with their different values for optimal results.
We will talk about the  ichimoku kinko hyo best settings later, but now
we will draw the following conclusion: the Ichimoku indicator is
designed for medium-term and long-term trading, i.e. for analyzing [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/)
and weekly charts.You don’t have to download ichimoku cloud indicator
mt4, as it is included into the platform indicators list.

### History of [Ichimoku Kinko Hyo](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/ichimoku-kinko-hyo.html) indicator

The Ichimoku cloud technical indicator was developed by Goichi Hosoda, a
Japanese journalist, in the late 1930s. The analyst published his
article in the trading journals, he was used to be known as Ichimoku
Sanjin.

The technical analysis indicator was named after his pseudonym. The
original aim was to predict the trend of the Japanese major stock index
Nikkei. The primary task of the Ichimoku cloud indicator is the
identification of a trend that is represented as the signal line, and
the secondary task is to show the support/resistance levels.

Although Ichimoku developed the tool before World War Two, he released
his findings to the general public much later, in 1968.  He spent 30
years perfecting the technique.

## Ichimoku Cloud Calculation & Formula

The Ichimoku cloud is composed of five lines, each of them is calculated
according to their own formula. The timeframe determines the ichimoku
kinko hyo settings.

Kijun sen is the average value of the highest high and the lowest low
for a specific time period. The default value in the ichimoku formula is
26.

Kijun-sen = (Max(High, M) + Min(Low, M)) / 2

Where:

Max(High, M) — the highest high for a period

Min(Low, M) - lowest low for a period

M - period.

Tenkan sen is calculated similarly, only the period is shorter (the
default is 9)

Tenkan-sen = (Max(High, N) + Min(Low, N)) / 2

Where:

(Max(High, N) - the highest high for a period

Min(Low, N) - lowest low for a period

N — is the period

Chikou Span is the current Close projected back by the period set
(default is 26)

Senkou Span A is the averaged value of Tenkan-sen and Kijun-sen,
projected ahead by the set period (26 by default).

Senkou Span A = (Tenkan-sen + Kijun-sen) / 2

Senkou Span B calculates the average of the highest high and the lowest
low over the period set (default is 52), plotted 26 periods ahead.

Senkou Span B = (Max(High, Z) + Min(Low, Z)) / 2

Where:

Max(Z) — the high for the chosen period.

Min(Z) — the low for the chosen period.

Z — period.

The suggested default values for the Ichimoku settings are offered by
the indicator developer, they are designed for the stock market. So, the
ichimoku cloud [best time](https://www.fixpro.org/post/forex-best-time-to-trade/) frame starts from D1 nad higher. You can
experiment with the periods, adjusting them to the type of market you
are going to analyze.

## Ichimoku Indicator Elements

The Ichimoku indicator is composed of several elements: three lines and
two Ichimoku clouds of different colors.

Two Ichimoku indicators are separate tools serving as moving averages.
However, they are not moving averages in fact. The Ichimoku cloud lines
have some peculiar features, which I will cover below.

The third line is a kind of oscillator to filter trading signals.

The clouds can be upward or downward, the color indicates the trend
prevailing in the market.

The below screenshot displays how the Ichimoku graph looks in the price
chart with the default settings.

### Tenkan Sen (Turning line)

Tenkan sen (the red line) averages the highest high and the lowest low
for the first time period. The default value 9.

The Tenkan sen indicates the short-term trend and its changes. It also
serves as support or resistance level, depending on which side the price
approaches it from.

Traders use the Tenkan sen signals to enter short-term trades at the
very beginning of the trend reversal or immediately after the end of the
correction to add up to the positions entered in the trend.

That is how Tenkan sen looks separately from other Ichimoku tools:

### Kijun Sen (Standard line)

Kijun Sen  (the blue line) averages the values of the highest high and
the lowest low for the second time period. The default value is 26.

The Kijun Sen indicates a more global trend, the medium-term trend. The
Kijun Sen period is longer than that of Tenkan, so the price breaks out
this level much more seldom. The trend changes also more seldom.

The Kijun sen signals are stronger. Traders see this line as an
independent support or resistance line. The signal is also delivered
when Tenkan sen and Kijun sen meet.

That is how Kijun sen looks separately from other Ichimoku tools:

### Senkou Span A (First leading line) and Senkou Span B  (Second
leading line)

Senkou Span A and Senkou Span B form the edges of the cloud. The A line
averages the values of Tenkan and Kijun, it is plotted 26 periods ahead.
The B line calculates the average of the highest high and the lowest low
over the past 52 time periods. It is also plotted 26 periods ahead.

These two lines can also serve as independent support and resistance
lines. However, the major function of these lines is to form the
Ichimoku cloud.

Depending on which line is higher (Ichimoku  Span A or Span B), the
Ichimoku cloud assumes one color or another, and suggests the likely
trend direction in the future.

In the Ichimoku cloud settings, you can set your own period for the
Senkou Span B line.

This is how the Senkou Span A and Senkou Span B lines look separately
from the other Ichimoku tools:

### Chikou Span (Lagging line)

Chikou Span (the green line). It is the so-called lagging span ichimoku.
It calculates today's closing price projected back 26 days on the chart.

This line serves as an oscillator. It indicates the price deviation from
the previous values. Differently put, traders look at price deviations
from this line to understand when the trend will exhaust and a
correction might start. Accordingly, they decide on whether they should
exit the trades and could trade against the trend. I will cover the
Chikou span signals in detail later.

This is how the Chikou span line looks separately from the other
Ichimoku tools:

### Kumo

In addition to the base lines, there are some other prominent elements
of the indicator, filled zones. They are the so-called Ichimoku clouds.
The cloud is the area between the Senkou lines А and B.

If Senkou A is below Senkou B, the zone is purple, which signals a
downtrend.

If Senkou A is above Senkou B, the zone is orange and the trend is up.

Ichimoku clouds predict long-term price trends. If the price is
currently above the cloud, and the cloud is orange, it is relevant to
buy. If the price is below the cloud, and the cloud is, accordingly,
purple, then it is relevant to sell.

The filled areas represent support and resistance zones for a long-term
trend.

For example, there is a clear gold price uptrend:

A clear gold downtrend:

When the cloud changes the color, the trader should expect a new long-
term trend

## How to use Ichimoku Cloud in Forex trading

We have studied technical aspects of the lines’ calculation. Now, let us
see what these lines are used for and what they mean.

In general, the Ichimoku cloud is designed to spot direction and
momentum in order to help you make buy and sell decisions more easily.
You can have a brief look at the chart and see the trend direction and
the price location relative to the support/resistance levels, and then,
you can look for a corresponding pattern to enter a buy or sell trade.

 **An important note.** The tool was designed to analyze quite long
timeframes, [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) and weekly charts of the Nikkei. Later, this algorithm
was applied to the forex chart analysis.

Besides, financial markets are more volatile than 90 years ago. The
Ichimoku Cloud still quite accurately anticipates middle- and long-term
trends, but it can also be employed in shorter Forex trading timeframes,
starting from H1.

I do not recommend using timeframes shorter than one hour. Perfect
timeframes to trade with the Ichimoku cloud are H1-D1.

You can trade any currency pairs.

### How to identify the trend using Ichimoku Cloud?

The long-term trend is defined using the filled zones, Ichimoku clouds.
If the price is trading below the cloud, the trend is down. If the price
ticker in the chart is trading above the cloud, the trend is up.

The color of the cloud is also important. A purple cloud means that the
price could fall soon. An orange cloud signals that the price should
start rising soon.

A perfect case for entering buy trades is when the price is trading
above the orange cloud.

When the price is trading inside a cloud it means there is no clear
trend.

The medium-term trend is defined by the Kijun line, and the short-term
trend is indicated by the Tenkan line. These lines are basically common
moving averages, but the calculation is different. They are the average
of high and low over a particular time. There is an opinion among the
speculators trading with the Ichimoku cloud that the Tenkan and Kijun
lines are more accurate than common EMAs.

You should also assess the direction of these lines and the angle. The
more acute is the angle, the stronger is the trend.

When Tenkan and Kijun are horizontal, there is the accumulation zone in
the market.

As the Ichimoku technical tool is a leading indicator, it can be used to
anticipate the market situation in the medium-term and long-term
outlook. The clouds projected into the future give clues on possible
movements of the trend.

The below screenshots present the examples of such projections:

### The role of dynamic levels of [Ichimoku Kinko Hyo](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/ichimoku-kinko-hyo.html)

All Ichimoku lines, except the Chikou span, may serve as important
levels. THey provide ichimoku kinko hyo info. It is suggested that the
Tenkan line is rather weak, while the Kijun line is a much more
important level.

Senkou A and Senkou B are key levels, which are the strongest. The cloud
itself is also a level.

Let us see how it works on an example:

### Flat zones - Ichimoku clouds

Flat zones are Ichimoku clouds, within which you can also trade. As you
know, when an instrument is trading flat, one should enter trades at the
borders of the trading range. If the price goes into the filled zone,
the Senkou A and Senkou B become reference levels, where one could enter
trades with targets at the opposite level.

The above figure displays the [GBPUSD][1] H1 chart. You can see that, on
April 23, 2022, the price broke through the Senkou A line and entered
the cloud.

Next, via the retest of the broken-out Senkou A, the price reached
Senkou B and even went beyond the cloud zone. At the next bar, however,
the price rolled back to the trading range, drawing a false breakout
pattern. The false breakout of the Senkou B was a signal to enter a sell
trade with the target at the opposing strong level.

Note that the price has twice tested the Senkou A line from above after
it broke the line out. A buy pattern was formed at the Asian session
and, later, at the European session. At the U.S. session, the market
sent a signal to sell the [GBPUSD][1].

### The role of the Chikou span oscillator

Basically, the Chikou line is a momentum indicator. Like any oscillator,
it is designed to indicate the price deviation from the average value.
Significant deviations create the overbought/oversold zones, which
indicates a potential correction or a trend reversal.

## Parameters and values: [Ichimoku Kinko Hyo](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/ichimoku-kinko-hyo.html) best settings

Let us enter the Ichimoku indicator parameters. We see three variables:

  1. Tenkan period (default value = 9)

  2. Kijun period (default value = 26)

  3. Senkou Span B period ( default value = 52)

The default settings of the Ichimoku cloud are quite effective, so I do
not recommend [beginners](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-for-beginners/) to change them. When you study the working
principle of the Ichimoku tool, you can experiment with its parameters.

Originally, Goichi Hosoda, when developing the indicator, referred to
the Japanese stock market and Japanese working days, which were six days
a week at that time. So, he took a period of 1.5 weeks for the Tenkan
line. The 26 period originally meant the number of working days in a
month, and 52 is the number of weeks in a year.

You can set the indicator parameters according to the current
conditions:

  * Tenkan = 5
  * Kijun = 20
  * Senkou Span B = 52

As a result, you will have the data changing more dynamically, but this
is not always better. Anyway, you should test the changed parameters and
compare them with the default values. Only after that, you can decide.

## How Ichimoku Cloud Works in Forex Trading: Signals & Strategies

Let us cover the Ichimoku [Forex trading](https://www.fintechee.com/forex-trading-strategies/) strategies

The Ichimoku indicator allows a trader to take a comprehensive approach
to market analysis. It indicates the current short-term trend, the
medium-term trend, and the long-term global trend.

So, using the Ichimoku cloud, you can build a Forex trading strategy
that will successfully work in any timeframe. Besides, you can easily
ichimoku indicator free download.

There are many trading systems based on the Ichimoku forex signals. I
will cover the top Ichimoku [trading strategies](https://www.fintechee.com/forex-trading-strategies/) and [how to](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-trading-how-to/) interpret
ichimoku cloud. I will also demonstrate [how to](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-trading-how-to/) trade with ichimoku kinko
hyo.

### Patterns of Tenkan and Kijun lines

Traders usually consider signals created by the Tenkan and Kijun lines
in two cases:

  1. When the lines cross;
  2. When the lines are facing in the same direction.

#### Tenkan Sen / Kijun Sen Cross

When the Tenkan line crosses the Kijun upside, there is a Golden Cross
pattern. This is a buy pattern.

When the Tenkan line crosses the Kijun downside, there is a Dead Cross
pattern. This is a sell pattern.

Based on the market situation, the above patterns may signal the trend
continuation or correction. They should be taken into account, but they
are not the strongest signals, so, I recommend trading according to the
patterns that are consistent with the general trend. To trade in the
correction, i.e. counter the trend, there should additional confirming
signals.

How to trade the Tenkan and Kijun crossing? You can enter a trade once
the signal bar closes in the free ichimoku charts. A stop loss is set
beyond the next local high or low. Another option is to enter a trade at
the breakthrough of the local high or low in the direction suggested by
the signal (i.e. if it is a buy pattern, you enter when the price breaks
through the local high).

There is no universal entry rule. You should make a decision according
to the particular market situation and your personal trading style.

#### Kijun and Tenkan alignment pattern

Kijun and Tenkan's alignment in the same direction means that the local
and middle-term trends are the same, which suggests entering a trade.
You should also analyze the long-term trend when you want to enter a
trade based on the alignment of the Ichimoku Kijun and Tenkan lines. The
long-term trend must confirm the idea to buy or sell a trading
instrument.

You can enter a trade immediately after a trending movement starts when
the lines have located in the same direction. You can also enter a trade
in the middle of the trend, but, in this case, you’d better expect a
correction or the test of the red or the blue line or the zone that is
created between these lines.

### Senkou Span A/Senkou Span B patterns

Signals sent by the Senkou Span lines and the cloud they create. The
Senkou span A and B lines could be the support or resistance levels,
depending on the trend. The Senkou Span A is a less important level, the
Senkou Span B is thought to be stronger, it marks the border of the
long-term trend.

The cloud’s color changes when the faster Senkou Span A crosses the
slower Senkou Span B, and so, there are early signals of the trend
reversal. Therefore, entering a trade after these lines cross will be at
the inceptive stage of a new trend. Here is the example of trading
signals occurred when the cloud’s color changes:

I recommend entering a trade after the Ichimoku cloud has changed the
color. A Stop Loss, in a perfect situation, is put at some distance from
the cloud. Note that the new cloud forms 26 periods ahead, so pay
attention to the moment when the signal to buy or sell the pound was
formed in the above screenshot.

### Senkou Span Cross

There is another signal, a leading one, when the price breaks out the
Senkou Span B. Differently put, it is an ichimoku uptrend cloud
crossover. The line itself is a dynamic level and marks the trend
border. Therefore, if the outer border is not broken, the trend is
likely to continue. If the price breaks through the filled zone, the
trend should reverse soon.

Let us study the examples of the rebound and the breakout of the Senkou
Span B line. I recommend you to pay attention to the breakouts and the
price further movement:

### Kumo Breakout

When the price is trading within the filled area, the cloud, it means
there is forming an accumulation zone or flat. When the price is trading
flat, one should enter trades at the borders of the range, and this
trading strategy is not as simple as trading with the trend.

To have a more or less wide trading range, you need to expect cloud
expansion and spot ichimoku cloud buy singlas. It is not always relevant
to enter trades when the price is within the Ichimoku cloud.

Trading in the range suggests entering trades in the direction of the
Senkou Span B when the price breaks out the Senkou Span A. When the
price reaches Senkou Span B you should be trading in the direction of
the first line and so on.

I do not recommend one to use limit orders or enter a trade immediately
after the price breaks out the Senkou Span A. First, the breakout could
be false. Second, the range within the cloud usually doesn’t allow
entering on the breakout with an acceptable Reward/Risk ratio (2/1 or
more).

Tenkan and Kijun in the Ichimoku cloud are still strong levels. It is
safer to enter trades at the levels around these lines.

The above screenshot displays two different cases. In the left figure,
the price was trading between Span A and Span B. In the right one, the
Tenkan and Kijun were also used as strong levels.

Trading inside the cloud is employed by professional Ichimoku traders
who know what they do. To detail the entry point, they use shorter
timeframes and the Japanese candlestick patterns to supplement an
ichimoku cloud strategy. I do not recommend newbies to trade in the
cloud, as this trading strategy is quite difficult. Beginner traders
should first master trading according to simpler and stronger signals
described above.

### Chikou Span Cross

As I wrote earlier, the Chikou Span serves as an oscillator in the
Ichimoku trading system. Therefore, the first thing you should pay
attention to is how the price has deviated from the green line. A wide
gap between the oscillator and the current price means there should soon
start a correction opposite to the main trend.

If you witness such a situation and the Japanese candlesticks generate
an additional pattern to buy or sell counter the major trend, you can
use this important signal and trade in the direction of the correction.

Another important signal within an ichimoku strategy appears when the
Chikou Span crosses the price chart. When the Chikou Span line crosses
the price chart from below, this is a buy signal. If the Ichimoku Chikou
comes from above, this is a sell signal.

You should remember that the oscillator is projected back 26 bars.
Approximately as many days, according to the Ichimoku tool developer,
large traders need to accumulate the position before the further strong
move.

In the above example, the bar marked with a purple vertical line marks
the point where the Chikou span breaks through the price chart either
upside or downside. The orange line marks the bar that generates a buy
or a sell signal, accordingly. The pattern appears quite seldom in
ichimoku charts, but it is a strong signal in the Ichimoku trading
strategies.

###  All the lines are arranged in the same direction

When all the indicator’s lines are facing in the same direction, there
is a strong pattern that suggests entering a trade in the trend
direction.

We see from the examples that the Ichimoku cloud, the Tenkan sen and
Kijun sen are directed in the same direction, which indicates the entry
direction.

### Signals summary

As you can see, there are quite many patterns generated by the Ichimoku
indicator. How to read ichimoku cloud? At first, it can be difficult for
a beginner to figure out which signal is delivered by a particular
combination of lines and clouds. What trade should you enter according
to a signal? How much time should you hold the trade you enter?

I have made a classification of Ichimoku strategy signals to help you in
future.

## Japanese candlesticks in the Forex Ichimoku trading system

Ichimoku Sanjin stressed the importance of using the Japanese
candlestick analysis when trading the Ichimoku signals. Without
analyzing the patterns generated by the Japanese candlesticks, the
probability that the trade entered according to an ichimoku strategy
will be successful is about 60%-70%. However, if professional trades
apply the analysis of Japanese candlesticks as an additional filter,
they can reach an 80% chance of success or even more.

Here, the Ichimoku trading strategy becomes more complicated, and you
will have to miss some signals. However, if you practice the candlestick
analysis, you will achieve better results as you will cut the potential
stop loss size, detail the entry point more accurately and exit the
trades on time.

I recommend you to confirm your trading ideas to buy or sell within any
ichimoku strategy employing the signals delivered by simple candlestick
patterns. You can also employ Price Action patterns. You do not have to
learn and trade all the patterns.

Three or five most common price patterns will be enough, provided you
use them often. After all, an indicator is just a derivative of the
price movements, and the price chart is always primary. Only the price
movements indicate the real market situation.

I covered in detail the most important price action patterns in the
previous educational article, [Price Action Forex strategies][2].

## Ichimoku trading strategy

Let us study a real example of trading with the Ichimoku indicator. The
[Ichimoku Kinko Hyo](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/ichimoku-kinko-hyo.html) download indicator is a kind of independent trading
system. So, we won’t employ any additional filters or analytical tools.
We should trade according to the signals described in the article.

I will try to demonstrate a simple Ichimoku mq4trading strategy. It is a
medium-term trading strategy, so it may take quite a long time to hold
the trade until there is a profit.

We shall not trade all the signals. Concerning this ichimoku strategy, I
will cover only the simplest patterns for a beginner, such as the Golden
Cross and the Dead Cross. A good not necessary entry condition is Kijun
and Tenkan's alignment in the same direction.

Primary condition, we shall strictly follow are:

  1. As Ichimoku is a trend indicator, we shall trade only with the long-term trend, which is indicated by the cloud’s color. The orange cloud signals buy entries, the purple cloud signals sell trades.

  2. A stop loss shouldn’t exceed reasonable limits. If it is greater than the weekly ATR, we won’t enter such a trade. We are going to trade in a calm market. What does it mean? It means that, following sharp price movements in the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) chart, we shall expect the moment when the market goes back to norm.

  3. After the price hits significant extremes in the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) chart, we should move the trade to the breakeven.

  4. A stop loss will be set either beyond the Kijun sen and Tenkan sen or beyond the cloud, according to which is closer to the entry point. In exceptional cases, a stop loss is placed beyond the nearest local high / low if the Tenkan Sen and Kijun Sen lines are too close to the current entry price.

  5. Reward/Risk ratio will always be 2/1. So, the potential take-profit is twice as big as a potential stop-loss. This makes it easier to set the target profit. 

So, I open the first position on gold (XAUUSD) according to the Ichimoku
strategy on December 27 2019. All indicator settings are standard. You
see from the below screenshot the chart drew a golden cross pattern to
buy on 12-13 December. However, the cloud indicates a long-term
downtrend. Next, I do the following. I expect until the cloud goes
orange, i.e. the long-term trend turns up. If the golden cross pattern
is still relevant, I entered the trend.

Some time later, the price breaks through a significant high, the high
of September 2019. I move the trade to the breakeven.

A day later, the trade is closed by the take profit.

Based on ichimoku charting, I enter the next trade on gold in six weeks.
There is a long-term uptrend, according to the orange cloud. A golden
cross forms on February 14. I open a buy position.

The price breaks through the local high, I move the trade to the
breakeven.

A few days later, the trade is closed by the take profit.

Now, I will demonstrate to you examples of the high market volatility.
According to rule 2 of the trading system, we shouldn’t enter trades in
a highly volatile market, as the stop-loss exceeds an average weekly
price change. 700-800 is a very high value for a stop loss. We shall
expect until the market stabilizes.

I miss another trade after the long-term reverses up again. The price
jumps back to the price levels, recorded in the February-March period
2019. Here, I don’t enter a trade because the size of the potential stop
loss is not appropriate.

I enter the next trade in the long-term uptrend after three months of
waiting.

The position is closed with a take profit by take profit. I forgot to
make a snapshot when I closed the trade, so I made it at the time of
writing.

As you see, it is quite simple to trade with the ichimoku kinko hyo
cloud. I demonstrated you a simple trading strategy based on two
Ichimoku signals, the Golden Cross and the Dead Cross patterns. These
signals must correspond to the ongoing global trend, as Ichimoku is
first of all a trend indicator.

If you trade only these two patterns, you will receive quite a few
signals for instruments in a year. However, the signals will be very
accurate. If you want to enter more trades, you should learn other
Ichimoku patterns and trade more financial instruments.

The most important rule is that you shouldn’t enter trades counter the
trend and when the market volatility is very high. You’d better wait for
some time and even miss a trade than take an unreasonable risk of a
loss.

## Conclusion and a trader opinion of [Ichimoku Kinko Hyo](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/ichimoku-kinko-hyo.html)

The [Ichimoku Kinko Hyo](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/ichimoku-kinko-hyo.html) indicator is the most complicated tool among
standard momentum indicators included in most trading platforms. This is
a free indicator, which is an advantage.

Although the Ichimoku signals seem complicated to read, any trader can
understand the Ichimoku indicator.

Of course, I recommend all traders to study and use in practice this
powerful technical tool. Basically, it is a complete trading strategy
suitable for all [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s. It considers trading with the trend, flat,
and trading in the correction.

If you are a newbie, I recommend you to start studying the Ichimoku
indicator and strategies trading with a long-term trend. When you go
through this stage and gain more trading experience, you can employ
other patterns as well.

Do not forget to confirm your trading ideas to buy or sell with
candlestick patterns. This will allow you to be more confident when
making trading decisions and get a better Reward/Risk ratio. I think
using a Price Action Forex strategy when you consider entries at the key
levels will help you increase the final profit.

It can take you quite a long time to master the Ichimoku trading system,
but it is obviously worth studying, as the chance of a win is about 80%
