Short-term forecast for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 27.01.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

Oil medium-term trend is up. The growth target is Target Zone 4 [54.72 -
54.21]

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

Oil medium-term trend is up. The growth target is Target Zone 4 [54.72 -
54.21]. Now the price is trading in the correction.

Favorable prices are needed to make new purchases. According to the
methodology, they are in the trend key support [49.39 - 48.94] zone.

The short-term trend is up. The target of the trend is Target Zone 3
[55.00 - 54.53]. Last week, traders tested the key support of the
Intermediary Zone trend [51.66 - 51.43]. The price didn’t break out the
zone.

The prices are growing this week. Yesterday resistance located in the
Additional Zone [52.66 - 52.55] was broken out. Look for patterns to buy
oil with the first target at January's high.

An alternative scenario: a return under the Additional Zone resistance
[52.66 - 52.55] and the formation of a sell pattern. In this case, sell
oil with a target at last week's low.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

  1. Buy according to the pattern in Additional Zone [52.66 - 52.55]. TakeProfit: 53.90, Target Zone 3 [55.00 - 54.53]. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. If there is a return under the resistance Additional Zone [52.66 - 52.55], sell according to the pattern. TakeProfit: 51.43. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

Gold is testing the broken-out accumulation zone [1859 - 1816] from top
to bottom. Look for purchases within the medium-term uptrend with the
target at Target Zone 2 [2005.8 - 1994.3].

Sell metal if the traders break out the level of 1818 and consolidate
the price below.

The local short-term trend is up. Now the traders are testing the
support Additional Zone [1849 - 1847]. Today look for purchases in this
zone with the target at Target Zone [1912 - 1902].

If the Additional Zone is broken out, the price will go into a deeper
correction in the Intermediary Zone [1825 - 1820]. This is the border of
the trend. If it is reached, look for purchases as well.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

  1. Hold up medium-term purchases entered in the zone of [1859.2 - 1816.9]. TakeProfit: Target Zone 2 [2005.8 - 1994.3]. StopLoss: 1830.

  2. Enter short-term buy trades according to the pattern in Additional Zone [1849 - 1847]. TakeProfit: 1874, Target Zone [1912 - 1902]. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

The euro is currently trading in the zone of good sell prices [1.2229 -
1.2146] according to the methodology.  Expect a sell pattern to be
formed.

The short-term trend is up. Yesterday the trend key support [1.2109 -
1.2101] was tested. This led to a reaction from traders. Accordingly,
the EURUSD rate has grown.

Today, close part of the purchases according to the pattern, transfer
the rest to breakeven and hold up until the price reaches the maximum of
January 22.

If there is a repeated decline of prices to the IZ area, then look for
purchases again.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

  1. Hold up a part of purchases entered according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone [1.2109 - 1.2101]. TakeProfit: 1.2187. StopLoss: at breakeven.

  2. Open buy positions according to the pattern [1.2109 - 1.2077]. TakeProfit: 1.2187. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.
