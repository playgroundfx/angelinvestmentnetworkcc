Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 27.01.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

The BTCUSD, ETHUSD, and XRPUSD cryptocurrency pairs have not completed
the fourth corrective waves. So, the prices could go down in the next
few days.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

The BTCUSD market is forming a global bullish impulse, with corrective
wave 4 developing inside. Wave 4 is unfolding as a bearish triple zigzag
[W]-[X]-[Y]-[X]-[Z]. The first four sub-waves of this pattern have
completed, and there is now forming the final motive wave [Z]. Wave [Z],
like other motive waves [W] and [Y], may conclude as a standard zigzag
(a)-(b)-(c). The price should go up in a short corrective wave (b);
next, the market should decline in the impulse wave (c) to a level of
28000.00. The target is at the support line drawn across the peaks of
waves [W] and [Y].

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Sell 32144.00 TP 28000.00

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

In the long term, the XRPUSD is forming a global zigzag A-B-C, where the
first two sub-waves have completed. There is now forming the impulse
wave C. The C wave's first three legs have already completed, and the
corrective wave 4 is still developing. Wave 4 is a bearish triple zigzag
[w]-[x]-[y]-[x]-[z]. Over the next few days, there should be forming the
final leg [z] as a downward zigzag (a)-(b)-(c). Wave [z] should conclude
at a level of around 0.230, which is at the support level.

### Trading plan for **[XRPUSD][2]** today:

Sell 0.264, TP 0.230

## Elliott wave Ethereum analysis

The ETHUSD market is forming an upward impulse composed of the sub-waves
1-2-3-4-5. There is now forming the corrective wave 4, which has a
complex structure composed of the sub-waves [w]-[x]-[y]-[x]-[z]. There
is now developing the final sub-wave [z], which is unfolding as a simple
zigzag (a)-(b)-(c). The corrective wave (b) should soon complete, and
the market will start declining in the impulse wave (c). The price
should go down to a level of 1100.00, which is the support level.

### Trading plan for  **[ETHUSD][3] **today:

Sell 1318.50, TP 1100.00
