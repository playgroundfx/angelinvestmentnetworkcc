Economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the week 07.09.2020 – 13.09.2020Jana Kane

##  **Review of the main events of the Forex economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the
next trading week (07.09.2020 – 13.09.2020)**

 **Trading on key Forex [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/): next week we are expecting the publication
of important macro statistics from Japan, Eurozone, China, Great
Britain, Germany, US, as well as the results of meetings of the Bank of
Canada and the ECB.**

The recovery of the American economy continues. This was evidenced by
the data published last Friday from the US labor market. The number of
jobs in the US economy in August increased by more than 1.3 million, and
the relatively high unemployment rate fell to 8.4% from 10.2% in July
and a record high of 14.7% in April. Investors reacted positively to
this information: American stock indices rose, but still could not level
the fall on Thursday.

The dollar also reacted positively to the publication of data from the
US labor market, and the DXY dollar index ended last week in positive
territory.

In the long run, low interest rates and a gradual recovery in the global
economy will support risky stock market assets, but the dollar is likely
to remain under pressure, maintaining negative dynamics and a tendency
to weaken further.

Next week, two of the world's largest central banks (Bank of Canada and
the ECB) will hold their regular meetings and decide on the interest
rate. Economists do not expect the leaders of these banks to make any
changes to the current monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), although unexpected decisions
are also possible. Any movements or signals toward further easing of the
policies of these banks will cause increased volatility in the financial
markets and weakening of the CAD or EUR, respectively.

Investors will also pay attention to the publication of important macro
statistics from Japan, Eurozone, China, Great Britain, Germany, and the
US.

 **Traders should pay attention to the publication of the following
macro indicators:**

 ***during the coming week, new events may be added to the [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) and
/ or some scheduled events may be canceled**

###  **23:50 JPY Japan GDP Q2 2020 (final estimate)**

GDP is considered an indicator of the general state of a country's
economy and estimates the rate of its growth or decline. The report on
gross domestic product published by the Cabinet of Ministers of Japan
expresses in monetary [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) the total value of all final goods and
services produced by Japan over a certain period of time. An upward
trend in GDP is considered a positive factor for the national currency
(yen), while a low result is considered negative (or bearish).

In the previous 1st quarter of 2020, the country's GDP contracted by
-0.6% (-2.2% yoy) after falling by -1.8% (-7.1% yoy) in the 4th quarter
2019.

Japan's GDP is expected to contract by -0.7% in the second quarter of
2020 (-27.8% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)). The preliminary estimate implied a
decrease in GDP in the 2nd quarter by -7.8% or -27.2% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/).

The data point to quite a noticeable slowdown in the Japanese economy
since the end of 2019, and this is a negative factor for the yen and the
Japanese stock market.

If the data turns out to be even weaker, then the yen may decline
significantly in the short term. Better-than-forecast data may
strengthen the yen (in the short term).

However, it should also be noted that in recent weeks, financial market
participants have paid little attention to [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) and weak macro
statistics, abandoning defensive assets, including the yen, in favor of
riskier and more profitable stock market assets.

###  **Tuesday, September 8**

###  **09:00 EUR Eurozone GDP for the 2nd quarter (final estimate)**

GDP is considered an indicator of the overall health of the Eurozone
economy. The growing trend in GDP is considered positive for the EUR; a
low result weakens the EUR.

Recently, the macro data coming from the Eurozone have been showing a
gradual recovery in growth in the European economy after a sharp drop
earlier this year. However, the decision made by the EU leaders in July
to provide additional support to the economy (a recovery package in the
amount of 1.8 trillion euros was approved) will help stabilize the
economy of the Eurozone. As a result of quarantine restrictions,
restraint in spending by companies and consumers, as well as the
collapse of exports, the economy is on the cusp of the deepest economic
downturn since World War II.

The euro reacted positively to this decision. Nevertheless, according to
the forecast of economists, the GDP of the Eurozone is expected to
decrease in the 2nd quarter by -12.1% (-15.0% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) after an
increase of +0.1% (+1.0% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) Q4 2019 and a -3.6% decline
(-3.1% YoY) in Q1 2020. The preliminary (first) estimate of the Eurozone
GDP in the 2nd quarter also amounted to -12.1% (-15% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)).

If the data turns out to be weaker than the first estimate, the euro may
decline. The data better than the first estimate may strengthen the euro
in the short term, although there is still a long way to a full recovery
of the European economy even to pre-crisis levels (quarterly growth
within 0.2 - 0.4%).

###  **GBP Inflation report (exact time unknown)**

The Governor of the Bank of England and members of the Monetary Policy
Committee of the Bank of England will speak in parliament to comment on
the current economic situation and economic outlook. At this time, the
volatility in trading on the pound may rise sharply. Apart from GDP, one
of the main benchmarks for the Bank of England regarding the prospects
for monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) in the UK is inflation. If the tone of the report is
soft, the British stock market will gain support and the pound will
decline. Conversely, tough rhetoric of the Bank of England
representatives regarding inflation control implying an increase in the
interest rate in the UK will lead to the strengthening of the pound.

###  **Wednesday, Spetember 9**

###  **01:30 CNY Consumer Price Index (CPI)**

The National Bureau of Statistics of China will release the next monthly
data reflecting the dynamics of consumer prices in China. A rise in
consumer prices could trigger an acceleration in inflation, which could
force the People's Bank of China to take measures aimed at tightening
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). Increased growth in consumer inflation may cause
appreciation of the yuan, a weak result will put pressure on the yuan.

China's economy is the second largest in the world after America's.
Therefore, the publication of important macroeconomic indicators of this
country has a noticeable impact on world financial markets, primarily on
the position of the yuan, other Asian currencies, the dollar, commodity
currencies, as well as on Chinese and Asian stock indices. China is the
largest buyer of raw materials and a supplier of a wide range of
finished products to the world commodity market.

In January 2020, the growth of the consumer inflation index amounted to
+1.4% (+5.4% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)), and in May - the value of the CPI index
decreased to -0.8% (+2.4% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)).

Deterioration in macroeconomic indicators, including a decrease in
consumer inflation, may negatively affect the positions of the yuan, as
well as commodity currencies such as the Canadian, Australian, and New
Zealand dollars. To a greater extent, this applies to the Australian
dollar, since China is Australia's largest trade and economic partner.

According to the forecast, another acceleration in the growth rate of
the consumer price index is expected in August: +1.0% (+3.1% in annual
[terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) against +0.6% (+2.7% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) in July after its sharp
fall in the previous months.

The growth of the consumer inflation index will positively affect the
quotes of the yuan, as well as commodity currencies, primarily the
Australian dollar. However, a relative decline in CPI may negatively
affect them.

###  **14:00 CAD Bank of Canada's decision on interest rate. Bank of
Canada's accompanying statement**

The Bank of Canada will decide on the interest rate. In March, the bank
lowered the rate 3 times, bringing it to the level of 0.25%, in order to
mitigate the economic damage from the novel coronavirus pandemic.

In an accompanying statement, the central bank of Canada said that the
decision "aims to support the financial system, which plays a central
role in lending to the economy, as well as to create a foundation that
will allow the economy to return to normal." The central bank also said
in a press release that the spread of the coronavirus and the plummeting
global oil prices combined are weighing heavily on Canadians and the
Canadian economy.

"I will not argue about describing these actions as QE," said Stephen
Poloz, head of the Bank of Canada at the time (since June 3, 2020, this
post has been occupied by Tiff Macklem). If the government bond market
"does not function smoothly, with a narrow supply and demand spread,
then the rest of the system also does not work as it should," Poloz
said, explaining the need for QE.

Initially, at least 5 billion Canadian dollars per week will be
allocated for these purposes (the [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of purchases will be adjusted
taking into account the changing situation).

Quantitative easing and a significant cut in the interest rate should
contribute to the weakening of the national currency.

The impact of the coronavirus on the Canadian economy and the country's
labor market (in March, unemployment rose to 7.8% from 5.6% in February,
and the number of employed, as reported by Statistics Canada, fell by
1.01 million), as well as weakness housing market put pressure on the
Bank of Canada towards further easing of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).

However, the Bank of Canada is expected to keep its interest rate at
0.25% at its meeting on Wednesday.

Tough tone of the accompanying statement by the Bank of Canada on rising
inflation and the prospects for further tightening of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
will cause the Canadian dollar to strengthen. If the Bank of Canada
signals the need for a soft monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), the Canadian currency will
decline.

###  **11:45 EUR ECB's decision on interest rates**

The ECB will publish its decision on the key rate and on the deposit
rate. Tough position of the ECB on inflation and the level of key
interest rates contributes to the strengthening of the euro, soft
position and the cut in rates weaken the euro. In September 2019, the
European Central Bank lowered its key interest rate on deposits by 0.1%
to -0.5% and began buying bonds worth 20 billion euros a month, renewing
the so-called quantitative easing program.

In a subsequent press conference, former European Central Bank President
Mario Draghi said the balance of risks to the eurozone's economic
outlook "remains negatively biased," implying the possibility of
additional stimulus if needed.

The ECB's September rate cut was the first since March 2016, and “until
inflation is in line” with the target, which is just below 2%, the rate
will remain low. Now inflation in the Eurozone is stubbornly holding
around 1%, and the new forecasts of the ECB on rates and the QE program
can be seen as a signal of the inclination to further soften [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).

After Brexit, escalating trade conflicts and political instability in
the Eurozone are the main threats to the European economy.

Speaking earlier at the European Parliament, Christine Lagarde, who
became the new president of the European Central Bank in November, said
the ECB's monetary stimulus continues to have a beneficial effect on the
Eurozone economy. “I agree with the ECB Governing Council's view that a
stimulating monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) will remain appropriate over the long term,”
Lagarde said.

An additional factor that may put pressure on the ECB to further ease
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) is the coronavirus pandemic. Back in March, the ECB
signaled the possibility of [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) easing, and the bank's representative
admitted that the bank's management could lower the already negative
interest rates even lower.

Following the results of this ECB meeting, the key interest rate will
probably remain at the same level of 0%. The ECB's rate on deposits for
commercial banks is also likely to remain at -0.5%. At the same time, it
is highly likely that at this meeting the ECB will announce a new
program to stimulate the economy.

###  **12:30 EUR ECB press conference**

During the press conference, a surge in volatility is possible not only
in the euro quotes, but also in the entire financial market, if the ECB
leaders make an unexpected statement. Similar previous decisions by the
ECB on interest rates and subsequent press conferences have moved the
euro rate by 3-5% in a short time. The ECB leaders will assess the
current economic situation in the Eurozone and comment on the ECB's rate
decision.

The soft tone of the statements will have a negative impact on the euro.
Conversely, the tough tone of the ECB officials on the central bank's
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) will strengthen the euro.

###  **16:30 CAD Speech by the Governor of the Bank of Canada Tiff
Macklem**

Tiff Macklem replaced Stephen Poloz as Governor of the Bank of Canada on
June 3, 2020. Macklem faces essentially the same tasks as his
predecessor in this post.

The Canadian economy, as well as the entire global economy, showed signs
of a slowdown in the first half of this year, driven by the downturn in
business activity due to the coronavirus pandemic. Earlier this year,
Stephen Poloz said that the Canadian economy is robust enough to keep
rates unchanged despite the worsening global economy. However, the
situation is changing rapidly, and not for the better. It will be
interesting now to listen to Macklem's opinion on the sustainability of
the Canadian economy and the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the central bank.

If Tiff Macklem touches on the topic of the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the Bank
of Canada, the volatility in the quotes of the Canadian dollar will rise
sharply. His tough tone will help strengthen the Canadian dollar. Soft
rhetoric of Tief Maclem's speech and the intention to conduct soft
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) will negatively affect the CAD quotes.

He might also provide some clarifications for [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s after the next
meeting of the Bank of Canada on September 9.

###  **06:00 GBP UK GDP in Q2 (final release)**

GDP is considered an indicator of the overall health of the British
economy. The upward trend in GDP is considered positive for the GBP. The
UK's GDP was one of the highest in the world until 2016, when the Brexit
referendum was held. Then its growth slowed down, and with the onset of
the global coronavirus pandemic, the growth rate of British GDP went
into negative territory altogether.

The UK's annual GDP is forecast to decline by -20.4% in Q2 2020 (after
zero in Q4 2019 and a -2.2% drop in Q1 2020). This is a negative factor
for the GBP.

The main factors that can force the Bank of England to keep rates low
are weak GDP and labor market growth, as well as low consumer spending.
If the GDP data turns out to be weaker than the forecast, it will put
even more downward pressure on the pound. Strong GDP report will
strengthen the pound.

###  **06:00 EUR Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices  (HICP) in Germany
(final release)**

This index is published by the EU Statistics Office and is calculated on
the basis of a statistical method agreed between all EU countries. It is
an indicator for assessing inflation and is used by the Governing
Council of the ECB to assess the level of price stability. A positive
result strengthens the EUR, a negative one weakens it.

In May, the HICP index (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) increased by +0.5%, in June by
+0.8%, in July - by 0%. Forecast for August: -0.1%. Since this is the
second, final assessment, which coincides with the first assessment, the
euro is unlikely to react strongly to the publication of this indicator.
If the data turn out to be better than the forecast, the euro may
strengthen in the short term. The growth of the indicator is a positive
factor for the euro. The data indicate that inflationary pressures are
still low in Germany. The data is worse than the forecast and the
previous value will negatively affect the euro.

###  **12:30 USD Consumer Price Index (ex food and energy)**

Consumer Price Index (CPI) determines the change in prices of a selected
basket of goods and services for a given period and is a key indicator
for assessing inflation and changes in consumer preferences. Food and
energy have been excluded from this indicator to provide a more accurate
estimate. A high score strengthens the US dollar, while a low score
weakens it. In January the value of the indicator was +0.2% (+2.3% in
annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)), in February +0.2% and +2.4% (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)), in March
-0.1% (+2.1% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)), in April -0.4% (+1.4% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)).
Forecast for August: +0.2% and +1.6% (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)), which indicates
some improvement after the fall of the index in March and April. If the
August data turn out to be weaker than the forecast, then the dollar is
likely to react with a short-term but strong decline. The data will
strengthen the dollar better than the forecast.
