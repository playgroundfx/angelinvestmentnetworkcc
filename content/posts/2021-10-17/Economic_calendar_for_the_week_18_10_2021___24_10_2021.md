Economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the week 18.10.2021 – 24.10.2021Jana Kane

##  **Review of the main events of the Forex economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the
next trading week (18.10.2021 – 24.10.2021)**

The dollar closed last week in the negative territory with a 0.2%
decline. But for the American stock indices, the week was successful.
Stock indices rose for the second week in a row.

According to the minutes of the September meeting published on
Wednesday, the leaders of the US central bank are ready to begin the
gradual curtailment of the quantitative easing program, under which the
Fed makes monthly purchases of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed
securities in the amount of $120 billion. As the Fed Chairman Jerome
Powell said at a press conference on September 22, the central bank
notes that bond purchases may be cut “at the next meeting,” which is in
November. However, the minutes also show that only half of the 18 Fed
executives expect interest rates to rise by the end of 2022.

The American economy created about 4.9 million jobs through September,
which helped restore about half of the jobs lost during the pandemic;
the unemployment rate fell to 4.8% in September (from 5.2% in August and
5.9 % in June). Given the significantly higher consumer inflation, this
is enough to start cutting back on the Fed's bond purchases, but not
enough to start raising interest rates.

On the one hand, the Fed's [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) is still soft, given the ultra-low
interest rate, on the other hand, the reduction in the volume of
purchases of bonds will also means a reduction in the dollar liquidity
on the financial market, which should contribute to the strengthening of
the dollar.

Now market participants will carefully study the macro statistics from
the US ahead of the November (November 2-3) Fed meeting in order to
assess the extent of the expected reduction in the volume of existing
stimuli and to better understand the Fed's intentions regarding its
future plans.

Next week, financial market participants will pay attention to the
publication of important macro statistics from China, the UK, the USA,
Germany, Eurozone, and Canada.

 ***during the coming week, new events may be added to the [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) and

###  **02:00 CNY China GDP for the 2nd quarter. Retail Sales Index**

The National Bureau of Statistics of China will present data on GDP
growth in the 3rd quarter of 2021. In the 2nd quarter of 2020, China's
GDP grew by +11.5% (+3.2% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)), in the 3rd - by 2.7% (+4.9%,
respectively), after a decrease by -6.8% (-9.8% YoY) in the 1st quarter.
China's GDP is expected to grow +0.5% (+5.2% y/y) in the 3rd quarter of
2021, after growing +1.3% (+ 7.9% y/y) in the 2nd m quarter and +0.6%
(+18.3% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) in the 1st quarter of 2021.

China is the largest buyer of raw materials and a supplier of the widest
range of finished products to the world commodity market. China's
economy is already the first in the world, according to many sources,
pushing the American economy to second place. Therefore, the publication
of important macroeconomic indicators from China can have a strong
impact on the entire financial market.

The relative decline in GDP may negatively affect the yuan quotes, as
well as the quotes of commodity currencies and currencies of the Asia-
Pacific region, since it may indicate a slowdown in the growth rate of
the Chinese economy.

The growth of the indicator will have a positive effect on the Chinese
yuan, as well as on the world, primarily Asian stock indices, as well as
on the quotes of commodity currencies such as the New Zealand and
Australian dollars. China is the largest trade and economic partner of
Australia and New Zealand and a buyer of commodities from these
countries.

Therefore, positive macro statistics from China may also have a positive
effect on the quotes of these commodity currencies, although the
expected data indicate a slowdown in the world's largest economy, and
this is a negative factor for stock markets and quotes of commodity
currencies.

Retail Sales Index is published monthly by the National Bureau of
Statistics of China and measures total retail sales and cash receipts.
The index is often considered an indicator of consumer confidence and
economic well-being and reflects the health of the retail sector in the
near term. A rise in the index is usually positive for the CNY; a
decrease in the indicator will negatively affect the CNY. The previous
value of the index (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) was +2.5% (after an increase of +8%
in the last months of 2019 and a fall of -20.5% in February 2020).
Forecast: In September 2021, retail sales in China increased by +3.0%
(yoy), indicating an ongoing recovery, albeit at a slower pace than in
previous months of 2021, after a sharp drop in February-March 2020 of
the year. If the data turns out to be even better, the CNY will
strengthen even more.

###  **00:30 AUD Minutes of the October meeting of the Reserve Bank of
Australia**

This document is published two weeks after the meeting and the decision
on the interest rate. If the RBA positively assesses the state of the
labor market in the country, the rate of GDP growth, and also shows a
hawkish attitude towards the inflation forecast in the economy, the
markets regard this as a higher probability of a rate hike at the next
meeting, which is a positive factor for the AUD. The bank's soft
rhetoric regarding, above all, inflation puts pressure on the AUD.

During the last (October) meeting, the RBA kept the key interest rate
and the target level of yield on three-year government bonds unchanged,
at around 0.10%.

It should be noted that in September the RBA leaders decided to start
reducing the weekly purchases of government bonds. The buyback program
will now amounts to A$ 4 billion per week (up from A$ 5 billion
previously) until at least mid-February 2022. Head of the RBA Philip
Lowe promised that "the RBA will review the volume of bond purchases in
mid-February," noting a sharp deterioration in economic conditions.

Lowe reaffirmed the central bank's intentions not to raise interest
rates before 2024.

Many economists have already called this decision by the RBA to cut the
volume of stimulus a mistake.

Wages continue to rise slowly and household debt has risen to an all-
time high, which also puts higher interest rates in the longer term.

According to Philip Lowe, "there is no serious argument in favor of
tightening monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) in the short term." In his opinion, "some
time will pass before interest rates are raised."

Nevertheless, if the published minutes contain unexpected information
concerning the issues of the RBA's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), the volatility in
the AUD quotes will increase.

###  **Wednesday, October 20**

###  **01:30 CNY The People's Bank of China interest rate decision**

Since May 2012, the People's Bank of China has been steadily cutting
interest rates in support of Chinese manufacturers. The last time the
bank lowered the rate in April 2020 (by 0.20% to 3.85% at the moment).

In 2020, amid international trade conflicts and a slowdown in the global
economy, the world's largest central banks took the path of easing their
monetary policies in order to support national economies and increase
the competitiveness of goods exported from these countries.

The People's Bank of China is also in line with this process. The
depreciation of the yuan has become especially relevant in the last 2
years, when the confrontation between the two most powerful economies in
the world began. One of the measures to mitigate the negative
consequences of increased duties on the import of Chinese goods into the
United States was the depreciation of the national currency of China.
This measure was intended, among other things, to maintain the same
volumes of imports of Chinese products to the United States, which would
cost American buyers less due to the difference in the rates of the
national currencies of the United States and China.

The coronavirus pandemic has become an additional strong negative
factor.

Probably, at this meeting, the People's Bank of China will keep the
interest rate at the same level of 3.85%, although a rate cut is also
possible.

Nevertheless, if the People's Bank of China makes unexpected statements
or decisions, volatility may increase in the entire financial market.
Investors will also be interested in the bank's assessment of the
consequences of the coronavirus for the Chinese economy and its [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
in the near future.

###  **06:00 GBP Consumer Price Index. Core Consumer Price Index**

Consumer Price Index (CPI) reflects the dynamics of retail prices for a
group of goods and services that make up the British consumer basket.
The CPI is a key indicator of inflation. Its publication causes active
movement of the pound in the foreign exchange market, as well as the
London Stock Exchange FTSE100 index.

In the previous reporting month (August), the growth in consumer
inflation amounted to +0.7% (+3.2% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)). Forecast for
September: +0.4% (annualized).

Despite the relative decline, this reading indicates growing
inflationary pressures, which is likely to support the pound. Indicator
value below the forecast could provoke a weakening of the pound, as low
inflation will force the Bank of England to adhere to a soft monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).

Core CPI is published by the Office for National Statistics and
determines the change in prices for a selected basket of goods and
services (excluding food and energy) for a given period. It is a key
indicator for assessing inflation and changes in purchasing preferences.
A positive result strengthens the GBP, a negative one weakens it.

In August, Core CPI (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) increased by +3.1%. Probably, the
publication of the indicator will have a positive effect on the pound in
the short term, if its value is higher than the forecast and previous
values. Forecast for September: +3.0% (annualized). The indicator value
below the forecast and / or previous values ​​may provoke a weakening of
the pound.

###  **12:30 CAD Consumer price indices in Canada**

Core Consumer Price Index (Core CPI) from the Bank of Canada reflects
the dynamics of the retail prices of the corresponding basket of goods
and services (excluding fruits, vegetables, gasoline, fuel oil, natural
gas, mortgage interest, intercity transportation, and tobacco products).
The inflation target for the Bank of Canada is in the range of 1-3%. The
rise in CPI is a harbinger of a rate hike and a positive factor for the
CAD. Consumer Price Index increased in August 2021 by +0.2% (+4.1% in
annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)). If the expected data turns out to be worse than the
previous values, it will negatively affect the CAD. The data better than
the previous values will strengthen the Canadian dollar. Forecast: CPI
rose by +0.1% in September (+4.3% on an annualized basis), which is
likely to have a positive impact on the CAD.

###  **19:00 AUD Speech by the head of the RBA Philip Lowe**

In his speech, Philip Lowe will assess the current situation in the
Australian economy and point out further plans for the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
of the department.

Market participants would also like to hear Lowe's views on central bank
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and Australia's first
recession in 30 years. According to Lowe, "there are no serious
arguments in favor of tightening monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) in the short term," and
"it will be some time before interest rates are raised."

Any signals from him regarding a change in the plans of the RBA's
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) will cause a sharp increase in volatility in the AUD
trading and on the Australian stock market. If he does not touch on the
topic of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), the market reaction to his speech will be
weak.
