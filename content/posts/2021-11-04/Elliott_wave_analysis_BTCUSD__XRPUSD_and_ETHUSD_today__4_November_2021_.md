Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 04.11.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

 ****

The BTCUSD market continues forming corrective wave 4 as a double three
[W]-[X]-[Y]. Correction 4 has started after bullish impulse 3 completed.
Sub-waves [W] and [X] have completed as double zigzags within wave 4.
Next, the market has started declining in the bearish wave [Y], which
should be developing for some time. Therefore, one could enter short
trades at the current levels with a target at 56638.00.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Sell 62629.00, TP 56638.74

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

 ****

The XRPUSD market has completed the upward corrective wave [Z], which is
the final leg of the triple zigzag [W]-[X]-[Y]-[X]-[Z]. After the [X]
wave finished, the market has been rising in the [Z] wave composed of
sub-waves (А)-(В)-(С). There should soon start a new bearish wave, and
the price will be declining over the next few days towards the target
level of 1.1420. Therefore, one could enter short trades at the current
levels. The target is at the end of corrective wave 4 of a smaller
degree.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] **** today:

Sell 1.2258, TP 1.1420

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

 ****

The ETHUSD market is forming the long-term sideways corrective wave (4)
is an expanding triangle composed of sub-waves А-В-С-D-E. After the D
wave completes at the most recent chart section, the market must be
declining in the final wave E of the triangle. Wave E can be developing
as any corrective pattern. Therefore, it is relevant to enter short
positions with a target at 3882.00.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Sell 4569.32, TP 3882.00
