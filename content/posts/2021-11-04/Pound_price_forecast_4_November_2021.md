Pound acts blindfold. Forecast as of 04.11.2021Dmitri Demidenko

The Bank of England is on the verge of tightening its monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).
If the BoC officials decide to raise the rate, it will be the first act
of monetary restriction among the world's major central banks since the
start of the pandemic. How will [GBPUSD][1] price react? Let us discuss
the market outlook and make up a trading plan.

## Fundamental gold forecast for today

The Bank of England, by its admission, approached the November meeting
blind. Its officials predict that inflation will accelerate to 5%, but
this is not a fact. In addition, the UK jobs report will be released
only in the middle of the month. That's when the report will show what
happened to more than 1 million workers after their support program was
terminated. Blind decision-making increases the risk of political
mistakes.

The BoE has put itself into trouble by making hawkish statements,
including Andrew Bailey’s speech to stop rising inflation. Markets are
100% confident that the central bank will raise the interest rate from
0.1% to 0.25% on November 4. This will mark the Bank of England's first
monetary restriction since 2018 and the first monetary tightening among
major central banks since the outbreak of the pandemic.

### Forecasts for REPO rate changes in November

Unlike [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s, Bloomberg experts are not so sure about the rise in
borrowing costs at the November MPC meeting. 51% of them expect the
interest rate to remain at the same level, and the most popular vote
ratio is 7 to 2 in favor of keeping it.

The BoE's inaction is fraught with the further acceleration of
inflation, while an excessively rapid monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) tightening could
trigger a technical recession. Moreover, the UK is one of the first
major developed countries to use fiscal consolidation. This circumstance
plays into the hands of the MPC doves. On the contrary, the hawks began
to take advantage of the acceleration in consumer prices and the
positive PMI data. In October, the UK composite PMI rose to a new all-
time high of 57.8. Most likely, the fourth quarter will bring positive
[news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) to the economy, and it will be able to withstand monetary
restrictions.

### Dynamics of the UK inflation

A 15 bps increase in the interest rate will neither lead to a sharp GDP
slowdown nor a sharp inflation decline. However, this is an important
signal that the Bank of England does not intend to remain passive. It is
determined to act, and this is good [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) for the pound. On the other
hand, market expectations that borrowing costs will rise to 1.25% in
2022 may seem overly aggressive to the BoE. There is a possibility that
after the tightening of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), the bank may start acting
dovish, stating that the rate could rise and fall in the future. We
shouldn't rule out a hawkish surprise from Andrew Bailey in the form of
a faster abandonment of QE than is currently expected.

The divergence of opinions among [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s, experts, and MPC members
creates uncertainty and contributes to increased volatility, which has
always been bad [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) for the pound. It is not surprising that it falls,
allowing the sales strategy [outlined in the previous article][2] to
work. In my opinion, keeping the interest rate at 0.1% will allow
[GBPUSD][1] to reach level 1.35. Continue entering shorts on the pound
sterling. On the contrary, the increase in borrowing costs will allow to
sell the pair on the rise and enter [GBPJPY][3] and [GBPCHF][4] longs.
