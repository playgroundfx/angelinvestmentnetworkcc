## Fundamental US dollar forecast for today

### Limited depth of the S&P 500 correction, the rebound of the euro-
area GDP, and old patterns support the EUR/USD

The best way to predict the future is to create it. The Fed believes the
US GDP will take a long time to recover, but the White House still hopes
for a V-shaped recovery. But both Jerome Powell and Steven Mnuchin are
doing their best to support the US economy. The Fed’s Chairman announced
the Fed should lower the minimum loan size, which will improve the
ability of the Main Street Lending Program to support the businesses.
The Treasury Secretary expressed the intention to expand the fiscal
stimulus by late July. The U.S. consumer sentiment index has performed
the biggest monthly rise since 2011. Senate passed the extension of the
Paycheck Protection Program until August 8. Amid the above positive
factors, the US stock indexes stabilized at the end of the second
quarter, and so, the [EUR/USD][1] has not dropped below the bottom of
figure 12.

In the April-June period, the  [S&P 500][3] rose by 20%, which is the
best performance since 1998. Although the deterioration of the
epidemiological situation set the US stock buyers back, the major
bullish factors still work. The cheap liquidity and hope that the worst
has been over can push the US stocks up. Donald Trump is also interested
in the rise of the stock indexes. History proves that the current party
in power won the election in 87% of cases if the S&P 500 grew, but did
not decrease, over the three months before the voting date. According to
the most recent survey by the American Association of Individual
Investors (AAII), just 24% of [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are bullish. That's well below
the historic average of 38%. If there is good [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) about the coronavirus
vaccine, there will be more buyers.

### Quarterly dynamics of the S&P 500

The  [S&P 500][3] price trends have a significant impact on the US
dollar and the [EUR/USD][1] moves, especially now, when the greenback is
the major safe-haven due to the Fed. The euro bulls would be discouraged
without the support of the US stock indexes. However, the depth of the
stock market correction is limited, so the EUR/USD bulls still hope to
continue the rally. Especially since the single European currency has
its own benefits as well.

The euro-area is gradually defeating COVID-19, and it could follow the
example of China’s economic recovery, as China has won the fight with
the coronavirus earlier. China’s manufacturing PMI was up to its three-
month high in June. China Purchasing Managers Index has been above level
50 since March, which means the economy is expanding. Although the
recovery process is not fast in China, it should take a shorter time in
the euro area amid the huge stimulus of the EU governments and the ECB.

### Dynamics of GDP growth in China and other countries

The divergence in economic growth is an important factor in Forex
pricing. We should not also forget about psychology in trading. The
[daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) [EUR/USD][1] price chart shows the so-called golden cross
candlestick pattern, when a relatively short-term moving average, the
50-day MA, crosses above a long-term one, the 200-day MA. According to
BofA Merrill Lynch, the euro rose in 5 out of 6 cases in 45-50 days
after such a signal. The use of old patterns encourages the bulls to
hold the longs, supporting the consolidation in the range of
1.117-1.129.
