###  **Elliott wave[BTCUSD][1] analysis**

 **![LiteForex: Elliott wave cryptocurrency forecast today. Elliott wave
analysis Bitcoin, Ripple, Ethereum.][2]**

In the long-term corrective wave [4] that is unfolding as a double
three, the final wave (Y) is developing as a double zigzag W-X-Y. The
sub-waves W and X have completed, the final zigzag Y is yet developing.
The upward correction [b] should completed soon. After that, the market
should turn down and resume declining in the impulse wave [c] to the
support level as it is outlined in the chart.

The chart displays the structure of the down corrective wave (B) that is
unfolding as a double down zigzag W-X-Y. After the sub-waves W and X
completed, there started a corrective movement in the final bear wave Y
that is a double zigzag [W]-[X]-[Y]. The price can well rise a little in
the (B) correction. After that, the price should be declining in the
impulse wave (C) to a level of around 0.155, as it is outlined in the
chart.

###  **Elliott wave[ETHUSD][5] analysis**

The current structure of the ETHUSD market suggests that the price is
now following the corrective wave of a larger upward impulse
(1)-(2)-(3)-(4)-(5). Correction (4) is likely to be developing as a
double three W-X-Y, where sub-waves W and X have completed, and the sub-
wave Y is about to complete shortly. In the near future, the upward
zigzag [b] should complete soon. After that, the Ethereum price should
go down in impulse [c] to a level of around 216.76.
