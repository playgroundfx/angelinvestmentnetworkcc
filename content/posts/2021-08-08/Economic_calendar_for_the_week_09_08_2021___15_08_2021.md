Economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the week 09.08.2021 – 15.08.2021Jana Kane

##  **Review of the main events of the Forex economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the
next trading week (09.08.2021 – 15.08.2021)**

The dollar strengthened sharply after the publication of the US
Department of Labor report last Friday, which exceeded the forecasts.
Non-farm jobs in the US rose 943,000 in July, while unemployment fell to
5.4% from 5.9% in June. Economists had expected a growth of 845,000 jobs
and unemployment to fall to 5.7%. The dollar strengthened most
significantly against the euro and the yen. As a result, the DXY dollar
index, which consists about 57% and 13% of the euro and the yen,
respectively, increased immediately by 0.6% (+68 points at the end of
the week), rising to 92.80 and again returning to the highs of the last
month.

Gold quotes also dropped significantly. The XAU/USD pair dropped below
1762.00, showing the most significant decline since June 20, both amid a
strengthening dollar and rising US Treasury yields following the
publication of a strong report on the US labor market. Investors and
many economists believe strong employment figures could force the Fed to
raise interest rates faster than anticipated, as well as begin cutting
back on its current $120 billion monthly asset purchase program.

The July job growth was the largest since August 2020. Such strong
indicators show that next week, when few important macro indicators are
to be published, the dollar is likely to continue to strengthen.

Next week, financial market participants will pay attention to the
publication of important macro statistics from China, Germany, the US,
and the UK.

 ***during the coming week, new events may be added to the [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) and
/ or some scheduled events may be canceled**

 ****GMT time**

###  **Monday, August 9**

###  **01:30 CNY Consumer Price Index (CPI)**

The National Bureau of Statistics of China will release another monthly
data reflecting the dynamics of consumer prices in China. The rise in
consumer prices could trigger an acceleration in inflation, which could
force the People's Bank of China to take measures aimed at tightening
fiscal [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). Increased growth in consumer inflation may cause
appreciation of the yuan, a weak result will put pressure on the yuan.

China's economy, according to various estimates, is already the largest
in the world, pushing the US economy into second place. Therefore, the
publication of important macroeconomic indicators of this country has a
significant impact on world financial markets, primarily on the
positions of the yuan, other Asian currencies, the dollar, commodity
currencies, as well as on Chinese and Asian stock indices. China is the
largest buyer of raw materials and a supplier of a wide range of
finished products to the world commodity market.

In January 2021, the growth of the consumer inflation index amounted to
+1.0% (-0.3% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)), in February +0.6% (-0.2% in annual
[terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)), in May -0.2% (+1.3% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)), and in June -0.4% (+1.1%
in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)).

Deterioration in macroeconomic indicators, including a decrease in
consumer inflation, may negatively affect the positions of the yuan, as
well as commodity currencies such as the Canadian, Australian, and New
Zealand dollars. To a greater extent, this applies to the Australian
dollar, since China is Australia's largest trade and economic partner.

According to the forecast, the consumer price index is expected to grow
by +0.2% in July (+0.8% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)).

The rise in the consumer inflation index will have a positive effect on
the quotes of the yuan, as well as commodity currencies. However, the
data is worse than forecast and the relative decline in CPI may
negatively affect them.

###  **Tuesday, August 10**

No important macro statistics planned to be released.

###  **Wendesday, August 11**

###  **06:00 EUR Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) in Germany
(final estimate)**

This index is published by the EU Statistical Office and is calculated
on the basis of a statistical method agreed between all EU countries. It
is an indicator for assessing inflation and is used by the Governing
Council of the ECB to assess the level of price stability. A positive
result strengthens the EUR, a negative one weakens it.

The preliminary forecast for July was: +3.0% (against +2.1% in June,
+2.4% in May, +2.1% in April, +2.0% in March, +1.6% in January and
February, -0.7% in December and negative values ​​in the second half of
2020) in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/). If the data turn out to be better than the
forecast, the euro may strengthen in the short term. The growth of the
indicator is a positive factor for the euro. The data suggests
increasing inflationary pressures in Germany. The data worse than the
forecast and the previous value will negatively affect the euro.

###  **12:30 USD Consumer Price Index (ex food and energy)**

Consumer Price Index (CPI) determines the change in prices of a selected
basket of goods and services for a given period and is a key indicator
for assessing inflation and changes in consumer preferences. Food and
energy have been excluded from this indicator to provide a more accurate
estimate. A high value strengthens the US dollar, while a low value
weakens it. In June 2021, the value of the indicator was +0.9% (+4.5% in
annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)), in May +0.7% (+3.8% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)), and in April +0.9%
(+3.0% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)), which indicates some improvement in the
situation after the index fell in March and April 2020 amid the
coronavirus pandemic and the rise in consumer prices. If the data turns
out to be weaker than the forecast, the dollar is likely to react with a
short-term decline. Better-than-forecast data will strengthen the
dollar. Forecast for July: +0.4% and +4.3% (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)), which is
likely to have a positive impact on the USD.

###  **Thursday, August 12**

###  **06:00 GBP UK GDP for Q2 (preliminary estimate)**

GDP is considered to be an indicator of the overall health of the
British economy. The upward trend in GDP is considered positive for the
GBP. The UK's GDP was one of the highest in the world until 2016, when
the Brexit referendum was held. Afterwards its growth slowed down, and
with the onset of the global coronavirus pandemic, the growth rate of
British GDP went into negative territory altogether.

2Q preliminary forecast: +4.8% (+22.1% YoY) after falling -1.6% in Q1
2021, -19.8% in Q2 and growth of +1.3% in the 4th quarter of 2020. The
main factors that can force the Bank of England to keep rates low are
weak GDP and labor market growth, as well as low consumer spending. If
GDP data turns out to be worse than forecast, it will put downward
pressure on the pound. Strong GDP report will strengthen the pound.

###  **Friday, August 13**

###  **14:00 USD University of Michigan Consumer Confidence Index
(preliminary release)**

This indicator reflects the confidence of American consumers in the
economic development of the country. A high level indicates economic
growth, while a low level indicates stagnation. Previous values ​​of the
indicator: 81.2 in July, 85.5 in June, 84.9 in March, 76.8 in February,
79.0 in January 2021. An increase in the indicator will strengthen the
USD, while a decrease in the value will weaken the dollar. This
indicator is expected to be released in August with a value of 81.3.
There is a steady trend towards a gradual recovery in the growth of the
indicator, which is positive for the USD. The data worse than the
forecast may negatively affect the dollar in the short term.
