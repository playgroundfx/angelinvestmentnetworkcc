Elliott wave [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) forecast for Bitcoin, Ripple and EthereumRoman Onegin

## Elliott wave forecast for BTCUSD, ETHUSD, XRPUSD for today

###  **Elliott wave[BTCUSD][1] analysis**

 **![LiteForex: Elliott wave cryptocurrency forecast today. Elliott wave
analysis Bitcoin, Ripple, Ethereum.][2]**

The BTCUSD market is likely to be forming a large bear zigzag А-В-С. The
impulse wave A has completed, the corrective wave B is still unfolding.
Wave B consists of five sub-waves [w]-[x]-[y]-[x]-[z], as it is a triple
zigzag. After the second linking x-wave finished, there has been forming
the bullish zigzag [z] that is not yet complete. The market should rise
a little in the bullish impulse (c) towards the level of the previous
high made by wave [y], that is to a level around 7448.00.

###  **Elliott wave[XRPUSD][3] analysis**

 **![LiteForex: Elliott wave cryptocurrency forecast today. Elliott wave

The XRPUSD market situation is similar to that of the BTCUSD, there is
also developing a long bullish corrective wave after the down impulse
finished. This is the fourth wave in the beat impulse (С), so it is
labeled 4. Wave 4 is a triple zigzag, composed of five sub-waves. The
bullish zigzag [z] is now forming, being the fourth element of the 4
correction. The market should be rising in the (c)-wave of the [z]
zigzag towards a level of 0.204, that is to a level around the previous
high hit during the formation of correction 4.

###  **Elliott wave[ETHUSD][5] analysis**

 **![LiteForex: Elliott wave cryptocurrency forecast today. Elliott wave

The ETHUSD market is moving up in the corrective wave 4, which is a
bullish triple zigzag. The sub-waves [w]-[x]-[y]-[x] has completed. If
we analyze the [z] wave in more detail, we will see that it is a zigzag
compared of three sub-waves (a), (b) and (с). The market should be
rising in the final leg of this zigzag, the (c)-wave, towards a level of
189.64, as the [z]-wave is rarely a truncation in zigzags, so, the
previous high can well be exceeded.
