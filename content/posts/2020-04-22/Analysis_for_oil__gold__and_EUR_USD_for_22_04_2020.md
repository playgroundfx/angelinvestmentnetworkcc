Analysis for oil, gold, and EUR/USD for 22.04.2020Alex Rodiоnov

###  **USCrude –** **oil**

As you see from the chart, the oil price continues falling and hits
fresh lows. The price reached Target Zone 4 [6.49 – 5.93] yesterday.
Below this zone, there is the last support zone, Target Zone 5 [0.89 —
0.22].

The oil price is now trading at $5 per barrel. In the short-term
downtrend, the price reached Gold Zone 4 [3.69 – 3.41]. After that, the
price has been corrected to the key resistance [7.54 – 7.17]. Until the
price breaks out this resistance, I don’t recommend selling oil. It will
be relevant to buy oil when level 7.54 is broken out.

I neither recommend selling oil. Oil is now oversold.

 **[USCrude][3]Trading ideas for today:  **

If Intermediary Zone [7.54 — 7.17] is broken out, buy. TakeProfit:
Target Zone [11.67 - 10.92]. StopLoss: below the next local low.

###  **XAUUSD –gold**

Gold price reached the key support of the medium-term uptrend [1663. 9 -
1655.6]. During the rest of the week, I recommend looking for buy
entries according to the pattern with the target at the high if last
week and in Target Zone 5 [1757.2 — 1751.2].

![LiteForex: Analysis for oil, gold, and EUR/USD for 22.04.2020][4]

Gold is now trading in the short-term downtrend. After the price reached
Target Zone [1663.9 – 1655.6], it was been corrected up to Additional
Zone [1684.4 – 1682.2]. The price is now trading in the resistance zone.
If the zone is not broken out, the price should break through the
yesterday’s low.

Otherwise, the price should be corrected up to Intermediary Zone [1709.6
— 1705.0], and this is the key resistance of the trend.

 **[XAUUSD][6] Trading ideas for today: **

Open medium-term buy positions in Target Zone [1663.9 — 1655.6]
according to the pattern. TakeProfit: 1738.0, Target Zone 5 [1757.2 -
1751.2]. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

###  **EURUSD – euro/dollar**

EURUSD is not falling now, although the middle-term trend is down. The
price is now trading between two strong levels: [1.0957 - 1.0940] and
[1.0803 – 1.0786]. If you have sell trades entered in the resistance
zone, I recommend exiting a part of them and move the rest to the
breakeven.

![LiteForex: Analysis for oil, gold, and EUR/USD for 22.04.2020][7]

The short-term trend is down. The price is trading between the trend key resistance [1.0912 – 1.0903] (the price hasn’t tested it) and the lower Target Zone [1.0808 – 1.0790].

Today, I recommend looking for sell entries in the strong resistance
zones.

It will be relevant to buy the euro if the price breaks out IZ and the
US session closes it above the zone. If so, the target will be the upper
Target Zone [1.1012 — 1.0994].

![LiteForex: Analysis for oil, gold, and EUR/USD for 22.04.2020][8]

 **[EURUSD][9] Trading ideas for today: **

Hold down a part of middle-term sell trades entered in Target Zone
[1.0957 - 1.0940]. TakeProfit: 1.0773. StopLoss: at breakeven

> IZ - Intermediary Zone: responsible for the price momentum reversing

>

> TZ - Target Zone: a zone that is 75% likely to be reached after IZ
breakout.

>

> GZ - Gold Zone: zone in the medium-term momentum.

>

> All zones are calculated based on the average [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) price of the
instrument and margin requirements of the futures.
