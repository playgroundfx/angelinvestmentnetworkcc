Economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the week 14.06.2021 – 20.06.2021Jana Kane

##  **Review of the main events of the Forex economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the
next trading week (14.06.2021 – 20.06.2021)**

 **Trading on key Forex [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/): next week we expect the publication of
important macro statistics from the UK, US, Germany, Eurozone, China,
Japan, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, as well as the results of the
meeting of the central banks of the US, Japan, and Switzerland.**

The US dollar strengthened last week, while the DXY dollar index added
40 points over the week. Last week, meetings of the central banks of
Canada and the Eurozone were held, but neither the Bank of Canada nor
the ECB decided to change the parameters of their current monetary
policies, appealing to the instability of the recovery of their regional
economies against the background of the third wave of coronavirus.

It is noteworthy that at the press conference after the ECB meeting last
Thursday, its President Christine Lagarde said that the European economy
is lagging behind the American in recovery. In the US, annual inflation
in May jumped to 5%, the highest in nearly 13 years, while inflation in
the Eurozone is only 2%.

Now the focus of [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) attention is shifting to next week's Fed
meeting, at which the central bank officials are likely to also keep
loose monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) in place. The Fed has maintained its key rate at
0.25% since March 2020, purchasing at least $120 billion in government
bonds and mortgage bonds every month since June 2020.

Nevertheless, the opinions of market participants regarding the short-
term prospects of the dollar after the Fed meeting were divided.
Approximately half of them believe that the Fed's decision and its
statement, which may contain a signal that the discussion of the
stimulus reduction will begin earlier than expected, will not affect the
dynamics of the dollar. In their opinion, one should also expect the
dollar to weaken against currencies that rise along with commodity
prices or have high yields.

Nevertheless, unexpected and more radical statements on the part of the
Fed are possible.

If tough signals follow from the Fed, it will lead to the closure of a
significant part of the short positions in the dollar and to its
strengthening. The tougher the statements made by the Fed leaders
following the June 16 meeting, the more the dollar will strengthen.

Thus, the focus of the financial market participants next week will be
on the Fed meeting, which will end with the publication of the decision
on rates.

Nevertheless, optimism prevails on global stock exchanges, associated
with expectations of a further recovery in the global economy, both
against the backdrop of the unfolding vaccination against coronavirus in
Europe and North America, and over the soft [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the world's
largest central banks.

Next week, financial market participants will also pay attention to the
publication of important macro statistics from the UK, US, Germany,
Eurozone, China, Japan, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, and on the
results of meetings of the central banks of Japan and Switzerland, as
well as the Fed.

 **Traders should pay attention to the publication of the following
macro indicators:**

 ***during the coming week, new events may be added to the [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) and
/ or some scheduled events may be canceled**

 ****GMT time**

###  **Monday, June 14**

No important macro statistics planned to be released.

###  **Tuesday, June 15**

###  **01:30 AUD Minutes of the June meeting of the Reserve Bank of
Australia**

This document is published two weeks after the meeting and the decision
on the interest rate. If the RBA positively assesses the state of the
labor market in the country, the rate of GDP growth, and also shows a
hawkish attitude towards the inflation forecast in the economy, the
markets regard this as a higher probability of a rate hike at the next
meeting, which is a positive factor for the AUD. The bank's soft
rhetoric regarding above all inflation puts pressure on the AUD.

Market participants believe that the RBA will not raise interest rates
until 2024, as promised by central bank officials. Wages continue to
rise slowly, and household debt has risen to an all-time high, which
also puts higher interest rates in the longer term.

"The economic recovery will be uneven and unstable," and "unemployment
may remain high for a long time," said the leaders of the RBA after one
of the last meetings of the bank, promising that "the rate will not be
raised until the Central Bank sees progress in moving towards full
employment and stable inflation rates in the 2-3% range ”.

According to the head of the RBA Philip Lowe, "there are no serious
arguments in favor of tightening monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) in the short term." In
his opinion, "some time will pass before interest rates are raised."

Nevertheless, if the published minutes contain unexpected information
concerning the issues of the RBA's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), the volatility in
the AUD quotes will increase.

###  **06:00 GBP Report on the average wages of the British for the last
3 months. Unemployment rate**

On a monthly basis, the UK Office for National Statistics (ONS)
publishes a report on average earnings covering the last 3 months, with
and without bonuses.

This report is a key short-term indicator of the dynamics of changes in
the level of wages of employees in the UK. Earnings growth is positive
for the GBP, while a low reading is negative. Forecast: the June report
suggests that the average wages with bonuses increased over the last
calculated 3 months (February-April) by +4.9% (against +4.0%, +4.5%,
+4.8% , +4.7%, +3.7%, +2.8%, +1.3%, +0.1% in previous periods); without
bonuses - increased by +5.3% (against +4.6%, +4.4%, +4.2%, +4.1%, +3.6%,
+2.8%, +1.9%, +0.9%, +0.2% in previous periods). Thus, the expected data
is close to the average values ​​of the indicators. They also point to
the growing dynamics of the level of wages, which is a positive factor
for the pound, as it contributes to the growth of inflationary
pressures. If the data turns out to be better than forecast, the pound
is likely to strengthen in the foreign exchange market. Data worse than
forecast will negatively affect the pound in the short term.

Also at this time, data on unemployment in the UK are published. In the
3 months from February to April, unemployment is expected to be at 4.7%
(against 4.8%, 4.9%, 5.0%, 5.1%, 5.0%, 4.9%, 4.8%, 4.5%, 4.3%, 3.9%,
3.9% in previous periods). Since 2012, the UK unemployment rate has
declined steadily (from 8.0% in September 2012). This is a positive
factor for the pound, the rise in unemployment is a negative factor.

If the data from the UK labor market turn out to be worse than the
forecast and / or the previous value, the pound will be under pressure.

In any case, at the time of the publication of data from the British
labor market, an increase in volatility in the pound quotes and on the
London Stock Exchange is expected.

###  **06:00 EUR Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) in Germany
(final release)**

This index is published by the EU Statistical Office and is calculated
on the basis of a statistical method agreed between all EU countries. It
is an indicator for assessing inflation and is used by the Governing
Council of the ECB to assess the level of price stability. A positive
result strengthens the EUR, a negative one weakens it.

The preliminary estimate for May was +2.4% (against +2.1% in April,
+2.0% in March, +1.6% in January and February, -0.7% in December and
negative values ​​in the second half of 2020) in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/). If the
data turn out to be better than the forecast, the euro may strengthen in
the short term. The growth of the indicator is a positive factor for the
euro. The data indicate that inflation in Germany is accelerating, which
is positive for the euro. The data is worse than the forecast and the
previous value will negatively affect the euro.

###  **12:15 GBP Speech by head of the Bank of England Andrew Bailey**

Financial market participants expect Andrew Bailey to clarify the
situation regarding the further [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the UK central bank.
Volatility during the speech of the head of the Bank of England usually
rises sharply in the quotes of the pound and the London Stock Exchange
FTSE index, if he gives any hints of tightening or easing of the Bank of
England's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). Andrew Bailey will probably also give
explanations regarding the earlier decision by the Bank of England on
the interest rate and will touch upon the state and prospects of the
British economy after Brexit and the phased lifting of quarantine
restrictions due to the coronavirus. If Bailey does not touch upon the
issues of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), the reaction to his speech will be weak.

###  **12:30 USD Retail Sales. Retail Control Group**

This report (Retail Sales) shows the total sales of retailers of all
sizes and types. Changes in retail sales are the main indicator of
consumer spending. The report is a leading indicator, and in the future
the data may be greatly revised. A high result strengthens the US
dollar, a low one weakens it. A relative decrease in the indicator may
have a short-term negative impact on the dollar, while an increase in
the indicator will have a positive effect on the USD. In the previous
month (April), the indicator grew to zero (after an increase of +10.7%
in March, +7.6% in January and a fall of -2.9% in February), which
indicates that the improvement in this sector of the American economy
after the partial lifting of strict quarantine restrictive measures in a
number of states. Outlook for May: -0.4%, which is likely to negatively
affect the USD if the forecast is confirmed.

Retail sales is the leading indicator of consumer spending in the United
States showing changes in retail sales. The Retail Control Group metric
measures volume across the entire retail industry and is used to
calculate price indices for most products. A strong result strengthens
the US dollar, and vice versa, a weak report weakens the dollar. A
slight increase in indicators is unlikely to accelerate the growth of
the dollar. The data worse than the values ​​of the previous period
(-1.5% in April, +6.9% in March, -3.5% in February, +8.7% in January)
may negatively affect the dollar in the short term. Forecast for May: +
0.3%.

###  **Wednesday, June 16**

###  **02:00 CNY Retail Sales Index**

This index is published monthly by the National Bureau of Statistics of
China and measures total retail sales and cash receipts. The index is
often considered to be an indicator of consumer confidence and the level
of economic well-being and reflects the state of the retail sector in
the near term. A rise in the index is usually positive for the CNY; a
decrease in the indicator will have a negative impact on the CNY. The
previous value of the index (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) was +17.7% (after an
increase of +8% in the last months of 2019 and a fall of -20.5% in
February 2020). Forecast: In May 2021, retail sales in China increased
by +14% (YoY), which indicates that the indicator continues to actively
recover after a sharp drop in February-March 2020. If the data turns out
to be even better, the CNY will strengthen even more.

###  **06:00 GBP Consumer Price Index. Core Consumer Price Index**

Consumer Price Index (CPI) reflects the dynamics of retail prices for a
group of goods and services that make up the British consumer basket.
The CPI is a key indicator of inflation. Its publication causes active
movement of the pound in the foreign exchange market, as well as the
London Stock Exchange FTSE100 index.

In the previous reporting month (in April), the growth in consumer
inflation (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) amounted to +1.5%. Forecast for May: +1.8%
(annualized).

This value indicates growing inflationary pressure, which is likely to
support the pound. Indicator value below the forecast could provoke a
weakening of the pound, as low inflation will force the Bank of England
to adhere to a soft monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).

Core CPI is published by the Office for National Statistics and
determines the price change of a selected basket of goods and services
(excluding food and energy) for a given period. It is a key indicator
for assessing inflation and changes in purchasing preferences. A
positive result strengthens the GBP, a negative one weakens it.

In April, Core CPI (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) increased by +1.3%. Probably, the
publication of the indicator will have a positive effect on the pound in
the short term, if its value is higher than the forecast and previous
values. Forecast for May: +1.3% (annualized). The indicator value below
the forecast and previous values ​​may provoke a weakening of the pound.

###  **12:30 CAD Consumer price indices in Canada**

Core CPI from the Bank of Canada reflects the dynamics of the retail
prices of the corresponding basket of goods and services (excluding
fruits, vegetables, gasoline, fuel oil, natural gas, mortgage interest,
intercity transportation, and tobacco products). The inflation target
for the Bank of Canada is in the range of 1-3%. The rise in CPI is a
harbinger of a rate hike and a positive factor for the CAD. Core
Consumer Price Index increased by +1.6% in January 2021, +0.7% in
December 2020, +1.5% in November, +1.0% in October and September (in
annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)). If the data for May turns out to be worse than the
previous values, it will negatively affect the CAD. The data better than
the previous values will strengthen the Canadian dollar. Forecast: Core
CPI rose +1.9% in May (YoY), which is likely to have a positive impact
on the CAD, despite the relative decline in the indicator.

###  **18:00 USD The Fed's decision on the interest rate. The Fed's
comments on monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). Summary of Economic Projections from the
Federal Open Market Committee**

In March 2020, the Fed sharply lowered the interest rate (to 0.25% from
1.75% in February), and also announced the allocation of $700 billion
for the purchase of US government bonds and mortgage-backed securities.
Subsequently, the Fed has repeatedly announced additional measures to
support the American economy and inject cheap liquidity into the
financial system. Usually, with the easing of the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), the
national currency becomes cheaper and its quotations go down.

In 2020, the dollar declined as [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s withdrew funds from defensive
assets, buying more risky and profitable assets of the stock market,
which continued to grow despite the threat of a second wave of the
coronavirus epidemic and the associated economic slowdown. The role of
the dollar as a defensive asset was also declining. However, in 2021,
the dollar is strengthening, which is associated with an increase in the
yield of US government bonds, and the Fed has not yet responded to this
in any way.

The rate is widely expected to remain at 0.25% at this meeting.
Nevertheless, during the period of publication of the decision on the
rate, volatility may sharply increase throughout the financial market,
primarily in the American stock market and in the dollar quotes,
especially if the decision on the rate differs from the forecast or
unexpected statements are received from the Fed leaders.

Powell's comments may affect both short-term and long-term USD trading.
A more hawkish stance on the Fed's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) is seen as positive
and strengthening the US dollar, while a more cautious position is seen
as negative for the USD. Investors are eager to hear Powell's views on
the Fed's future plans for this year.

The FOMC Economic Projections include the Fed's report on inflation and
growth over the next 2 years from the FOMC and, just as importantly,
shows the individual views of FOMC members on interest rates.

###  **18:30 USD Press Conference of the FOMC**

The press conference of the US Federal Open Market Committee lasts about
an hour. In the first part, the ruling is read, followed by a series of
questions and answers that can increase market volatility. Any hints by
Powell about the possibility of a change in the current monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
will cause an increase in volatility in the dollar quotes and in the
American stock market.

###  **22:30 CAD Speech by Tiff Macklem, head of the Bank of Canada**

The Canadian economy, as well as the entire global economy, slowed down
in 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic. Earlier, Tiff Macklem said that
the Canadian economy is quite stable. However, the situation has changed
rapidly, and not for the better. It will be interesting now to hear
Macklem's opinion on the sustainability of the Canadian economy and the
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the central bank.

If Macklem touches on the topic of the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the Bank of
Canada, the volatility in the quotes of the Canadian dollar will rise
sharply. His tough tone will help strengthen the Canadian dollar. The
soft rhetoric of Tief Maclem's speech and the propensity for soft
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) will negatively affect the CAD quotes.

Probably, he can also provide some guidelines for [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s on the eve
of the next meeting of the Bank of Canada, which will be held on March
10.

###  **22:45 NZD New Zealand GDP for Q1**

The release of the data will cause increased volatility in the NZD.
Considering the recent rise in prices for commodities and agricultural
products (especially for dairy products, which is the most important
component of New Zealand exports), as well as the fact that New Zealand
is the least affected by the coronavirus pandemic compared to other
major economies, it is likely that New Zealand's Q1 GDP report will come
out with positive numbers.

It is expected that GDP in the 1st quarter of 2021 grew by +0.1%
(previous values ​​-1.0%, +13.9%, -11%, -1.2%, +0.1) and by +0.5% in
annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) (previous values ​​-0.9%, +0.2%, -11.3%, 0%, +1.7%). The
data so far remains controversial, although they indicate a continued
gradual recovery in the New Zealand economy after falling in the first
half of 2020. The data worse than the forecast will negatively affect
the NZD quotes.

###  **Thursday, June 17**

###  **00:00 AUD Speech by the head of the RBA Philip Lowe**

In his speech, Philip Lowe will assess the current situation in the
Australian economy and point out further plans for the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
of the department entrusted to him. Any signals from him regarding a
change in the plans of the RBA's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) will cause a sharp
increase in volatility in the AUD trading and on the Australian stock
market. If he does not touch upon the topic of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), then the
market reaction to his speech will be weak.

Market participants would also like to hear Lowe's views on central bank
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and Australia's first
recession in 30 years.

In early November, the RBA's key interest rate was cut to a record level
of 0.1%, and the target level of yield on 3-year government bonds was
also lowered to 0.1%. The decision to lower the rate and set the current
target for government bond yields was made to support businesses and
Australian citizens amid the rapid spread of the coronavirus pandemic.

According to Lowe, "there are no serious arguments in favor of
tightening monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) in the short term," and "it will be some time
before interest rates are raised."

###  **01:30 AUD Employment rate. Unemployment rate**

The employment rate reflects the monthly change in the number of
Australian citizens employed. The growth of the indicator has a positive
impact on consumer spending, which stimulates economic growth. A high
value is positive for the AUD, while a low value is negative. Forecast:
In May, the number of employed Australian citizens increased by +30,000
(after falling by -30,600 in April, by -264,100 in May 2020 and an
increase by +29,100 in January 2021).

Also at the same time, the Australian Bureau of Statistics will publish
a report on the unemployment rate - an indicator that estimates the
ratio of the unemployed population to the total number of able-bodied
citizens. The growth of the indicator indicates the weakness of the
labor market, which leads to a weakening of the national economy. The
decline in the indicator is a positive factor for the AUD. Forecast:
unemployment in Australia in May was at the level of 5.5% (against 5.5%
in April, 6.6% in December, 6.8% in November, 7.0% in October, 6.9% in
September , 6.8% in August, 7.5% in July, 7.4% in June, 5.2% in March,
5.1% in February), although it is approaching pre-coronavirus levels. In
general, the indicators can be called positive. In other large
economies, the labor market has deteriorated on a large scale due to the
coronavirus.

The leaders of the RBA have repeatedly stated that, in addition to the
situation in international trade, the Australian economy and the central
bank's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) plans are influenced by the indicators of the
level of household debt and expenditures, the growth of workers' wages,
as well as the state of the country's labor market.

In November 2020, the RB of Australia cut its key interest rate by
another 0.15%, to a new record low of 0.1%, due to the coronavirus. In
the opinion of the RBA management, an unemployment rate of 4.5% or lower
is required to raise wages and accelerate inflation to the target range.
Unemployment in the country is not decreasing, and a return of inflation
to the middle of the target range of 2% -3% is not even in the distant
horizon.

The AUD is likely to react positively to the publication of data from
the country's labor market. If the values ​​of the indicators turn out
to be worse than the forecast, the Australian dollar may significantly
decline in the short term. Better-than-expected data will strengthen AUD
in the short term.

###  **07:30 CHF SNB's decision on interest rate. SNB's statement on
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)**

The current rate on deposits is in negative territory and amounts to
-0.75%. At the previous meeting in March, the rate remained unchanged.
The central bank of Switzerland has consistently advocated for a soft
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) in the country, and traditionally considers the rate of
the national currency "overvalued". Recently, the franc has largely lost
its status as a safe-haven currency, and the threat of intervention, of
course, is holding back the franc from excessive growth. According to
the SNB leaders, the franc is “still very overvalued” and intervention
in the foreign exchange market remains “an important means of
maintaining the low attractiveness of investments in francs and easing
upward pressure on the currency”.

Traders will also scrutinize the SNB statement in order to pick up
signals regarding further SNB monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) plans. Tough rhetoric of
the statement will strengthen the franc. The soft tone and the
propensity to continue the extra soft monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the SNB will
negatively affect the franc. High volatility is expected in the foreign
exchange market and, above all, in trading in the franc, if the
management of the SNB makes unexpected statements.

###  **08:00 CHF Press conference of the SNB**

After the publication of the decision on the rate, the press conference
of the Swiss National Bank will begin. During the press conference and
speech by SNB Chairman Thomas Jordan, the volatility in the CHF trading
increases, and traders wait for signals regarding the future plans of
the SNB's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). Jordan’s tough rhetoric will strengthen the
franc. The soft tone of the speech and the propensity to continue the
extra soft monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the SNB will negatively affect the franc.

High volatility is expected in the foreign exchange market and, above
all, in the franc trading if Thomas Jordan makes unexpected statements.

###  **Friday, June 18**

###  **03:00 JPY Bank of Japan's decision on interest rate. Bank of
Japan's Press Conference and Monetary Policy Comments**

The Bank of Japan will decide on the interest rate. At the moment, the
main rate in Japan is in negative territory, amounting to -0.1%. Most
likely, the rate will remain the same. If it is cut and deepens into
negative territory, such a decision will cause a sharp decline in the
yen in the foreign exchange market and an increase in the Japanese stock
market. In any case, during this period of time, a jump in volatility is
expected in trading in the yen and in the Asian financial market.

Since February 2016, the Bank of Japan has kept the deposit rate at
-0.1%. The target yield for 10-year bonds is currently around 0%. In
2020, the Bank of Japan set an annual target for [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/) purchases of 12
trillion yen and expanded its aid program to coronavirus-affected
businesses to 110 trillion yen from 75 trillion yen. Under this program,
companies can obtain unsecured loans at zero interest rates. The goal of
the program is to support commercial companies whose bankruptcy rates
have skyrocketed in Japan in recent months, including due to the
coronavirus pandemic. The recent accompanying statement from the Bank of
Japan said that the bank's management will continue to "increase the
monetary base until inflation stays above 2%." “We will not hesitate to
take additional mitigation measures if necessary,” the bank also
traditionally said in a statement.

During the press conference, the head of the Bank of Japan Haruhiko
Kuroda will comment on the bank's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). The Bank of Japan
continues to adhere to its super-soft monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). As Kuroda has
stated on several occasions, "it is appropriate for Japan to patiently
continue with its current loose monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)." Markets usually react
actively to Kuroda's speeches. Surely, he will again touch upon the
topic of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) during his speech, which will cause an increase
in volatility not only in the yen trade, but also throughout the Asian
and world financial markets.

If the bank's executives decide that the Japanese economy is stable and
the momentum of inflation towards the 2% target is not diminishing, they
will refrain from changing [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).

###  **06:00** **JPY Press conference of the Bank of Japan**

During the press conference, the head of the Bank of Japan Haruhiko
Kuroda will comment on the bank's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). Despite the measures
taken earlier by the bank to stimulate the Japanese economy, inflation
remains low, production and consumption are falling, which negatively
affects export-oriented Japanese manufacturers. Markets usually react
actively to Kuroda's speeches. If he touches on the topic of monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) during his speech, volatility will increase not only in the yen
trade, but throughout the Asian and global financial markets.
