Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 28.01.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

All three cryptocurrency pairs covered in the article should be
declining in the impulse waves, which will conclude the triple zigzags.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

The BTCUSD market continues forming the corrective wave 4 as a triple
zigzag. The sub-waves [W]-[X]-[Y]-[X] have completed. The down wave [Z]
is developing now. The [Z] wave is unfolding as a simple zigzag
(a)-(b)-(c), where the impulse wave (a) and the correction (b) have
completed, and the market should be forming the impulse wave (c). The
price can go down to a level of 28000.00, which is a support.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Sell 31392.00 TP 28000.00

* * *

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

There is developing the impulse wave composed of five sub-waves
1-2-3-4-5. There is currently forming a long corrective wave 4 as a
bearish triple zigzag [w]-[x]-[y]-[x]-[z]. There is unfolding the final
motive wave [z] as a simple zigzag (a)-(b)-(c). Wave [z] should end at a
level of 0.230, which is a support. One could enter short trades in the
current situation.

### Trading plan for **[XRPUSD][2]** today:

Sell 0.255, TP 0.230

* * *

## Elliott wave Ethereum analysis

The ETHUSD market continue forming the corrective wave 4 as a triple
zigzag [w]-[x]-[y]-[x]-[z]. The first four legs of the pattern have
completed, and there is currently unfolding the final sub-wave [z]. Wave
[z] should complete as a simple zigzag (a)-(b)-(c). The price should be
declining in the impulse wave (c) to a level of 1100.00, which is at the
support line drawn across the peaks of the sub-waves [w] and [y]. One
could consider sell trades in the current situation.

### Trading plan for  **[ETHUSD][3] **today:

Sell 1279.22, TP 1100.00
