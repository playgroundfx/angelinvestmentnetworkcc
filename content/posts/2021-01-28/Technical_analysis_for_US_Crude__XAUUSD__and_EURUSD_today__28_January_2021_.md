Short-term forecast for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 28.01.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

Yesterday, euro traders worked out the zone [1.2165 - 1.2146]. Traders
showed an active reaction to the zone ahead of the Fed's interest rate
decision.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

Oil is correcting to a medium-term uptrend. A pattern is required for
selling, and a breakout of level 51.88 is needed for pattern forming.

According to the margin zones, the oil short-term trend is up. However,
the situation is the opposite. The most significant highs and lows are
going down.

Take your time with opening trades today. A pattern and a breakout of
the key support [51.66 - 51.43] are required to sell oil.

To buy, traders need to form a new bullish pattern by breaking out
yesterday's high of the day.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

Buy after price consolidation above yesterday's high. TakeProfit: Target
Zone 3 [55.00 - 54.53]. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

Gold is trading in the accumulation zone. A pattern is required for
purchases. Wait for the price to leave the accumulation zone up or down.

Let's take a look at the chart of a shorter timeframe and analyze the
situation. It shows a short-term uptrend with the target at the upper
Target Zone [1912 - 1902].

Now the price is trading in the correction in the zone of good buy
prices [1849 - 1820]. Look for a pattern to buy gold.

Alternative scenario: a breakout of the trend key support [1825 - 1820]
will reverse the short-term trend down, and the prices will drop to the
lower Target Zone [1775 - 1765].

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

  1. Hold up medium-term purchases entered in the zone of [1859.2 - 1816.9]. TakeProfit: Target Zone 2 [2005.8 - 1994.3]. StopLoss: 1830.

  2. Open short-term buy positions according to the pattern in the zone of [1849 - 1820]. TakeProfit: Target Zone [1912 - 1902]. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

Yesterday, euro traders worked out the zone [1.2165 - 1.2146]. From this
zone, traders' reactions passed before the decision on the Fed's
interest rate was made. As a result, the last week's low was repeated.

The price is correcting again but look for new euro sales in __ the
trend key resistance [1.2229 - 1.2213].

Despite the strong sell momentum yesterday, the euro short-term uptrend
remains. The US session closed in the area of the trend key support
[1.2109 - 1.2101].

Today continue to search for purchases according to the pattern with the
target at the upper Target Zone [1.2229 - 1.2213].

Sell the instrument when the traders break out the Intermediary Zone and
consolidate below. In this case, the target will be the lower Target
Zone [1.2029 - 1.2013].

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

Open buy positions according to the pattern in [1.2109 - 1.2077].
TakeProfit: 1.2187, Target Zone [1.2229 - 1.2213]. StopLoss: according
to the pattern rules.
