Horizontal volumes indicator in Forex tradingGleb Kabanov

## How to use horizontal volume to increase trading performance?

Hello, my distinguished colleagues. Today, I want to share my experience
of trading with the horizontal volume indicator. This method can be
universally applied, but it has different features for different markets
that affect trading a particular instrument. Using a horizontal volume
is an efficient tool that will help you make wise trading decisions in
the financial markets.

First, I would like to dwell on some theoretical aspects. As a rule, an
[individual trader](https://www.fintechee.com/services/individual-trader/) has limited financial resources and the amount of time
he/she can spend on the market analysis to decide to buy or sell. The
only source of information about the market sentiment and the price
changes is usually the price chart.

Most traders do not use fundamental analysis in trading, thinking it to
be of little use in making trading decisions. However, the success of a
particular trade depends on how the trader interprets the price chart
analysis data. So, formalization, algorithm, and the ability to read the
chart are extremely important for any trader.

Trading with technical analysis, traders usually use price chart
patterns and indicators that mostly reflect the price movements.
However, the trading volume indicates not the price, but the amount of
trades entered for an instrument. Assume that one order is put every
minute, and the price goes up by $1. If we look at the price chart in
the 5-minute timeframe, we shall see that the price goes up by $5, which
will be indicated by a bar, candlestick, or line.

However, the amount of an asset traded during this period, and so, the
amount of money spent on the price movement will be unknown. It can be
5, 50, or 150 contracts bought and sold at a given price. Why are these
data essential, and how can we use them in trading?

First of all, let us clarify the Trading Volume meaning. Trading volume
is the amount of a trading asset sold and bought during a particular
period. Time is a vital element of this indicator, and I will explain
why.

Most traders trade in the derivatives market and only a part of them
trade in the stock market. We see the price rates in the LiteForex
trading terminals when trading Forex or CFDs are derived from the
derivatives market prices, whose contracts are closely related to the
amount of money, liquidity, and placement period.

The price is determined when there is a buyer and seller who make a
deal. If the market liquidity is low, the price will move in jerks. If
buyers and sellers can’t find each other, the transactions will be rare.
If the cash amount is high, the price will run smoothly, and it will be
easy to find a counter-party.

Its short-term nature determines Forex liquidity. We see the [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) of
the price in the trading terminals. However, there are no longer
support/resistances consisting of real money, which are reflected in
three-month [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/). Differently put, there is a price, but there are no
traders at this price.

Looking at the price in the terminal [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/), we see only the trace of a
transaction once executed, its shadow, if you like. However, if you
consider the price level as a struggle between buyers and sellers, where
the price can stop, there is no real money at this level in more than
three months.

>  **So, nobody will struggle for this level. The oil market has similar
relevance of liquidity data over time. The gold market is a little
different, which is determined by the investment nature of trading gold.
But in general, the gold market’s time structure can also be simplified,
limiting the calculation of liquidity indicators to a three-month
[history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/).**

The first conclusion we can draw analyzing the support and resistance
levels as the levels for a struggle between buyers and sellers. Three
months is the deadline for which these levels will make sense in the
technical analysis. All quotes recorded longer ago won’t be relevant.

As my experience shows, you can consider three-month [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) levels to
analyze the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) timeframe. To examine the four-hour timeframe, the
levels of two-month [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) will be relevant. For the hourly timeframe,
the [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) one month will be enough.

For intraday trading, it will be enough to analyze the [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) of one-
two weeks. Consider these periods not only for the [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) data
analysis but also to analyze the prospects of the position you opened in
the market.

In this regard, analyzing weekly charts in the derivatives market is a
waste of time and resources. However, in the stock market, where
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s open long-term positions, the weekly quotes make sense. I
prefer to study the price movements in the stock market for six months,
a maximum of a year. For me, the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) chart is enough.

We explored the timeframes relevant for the chart analysis and found out
that we should analyze the [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) of no longer than three months. Now,
we shall explore the horizontal volume and how it is displayed in the
trading terminals. Well, trading volume indicates the market activity
and the liquidity traded at a particular level.

So, the higher is the volume, the more traders put their orders at the
level, and the more critical it for our chart analysis. Vertical volumes
indicate the number of transactions completed during a specific period.
Horizontal volumes sum up trade volume during a period and distribute it
at a particular price level. (fig. 1)

fig.1: EURUSD rate, timeframe Н4 – horizontal and vertical volumes.

Let's study the [EURUSD][1] market situation. The horizontal volume
indicator at the bottom of the chart shows that market liquidity has
significantly increased since February 24. We can conclude that the
uptrend is rather strong, as the higher is the liquidity, the stronger
is the price move. Besides, we can see the horizontal volumes, displayed
by the histogram on the right, are high at levels 1.1081, 1.1002, and
1.0839, which can serve as support and resistance levels.

Note that on March 12, 2020, the price rebounded up from level 1.1081,
having just touched it. It means that a big trader decided to insure the
long position from the price fall and bought a significant euro volume.
Therefore, if the big trader presumes that the [EURUSD][1] rate will
continue rising, level 1.1080 should be an excellent support. So, one
can put a stop loss below the next level of volume accumulation, which
is above 1.1000.

Why did I choose Jan 15 as a point for calculating the volume? I
selected that date because the first two weeks of the new year feature
low liquidity. The money comes into the market starting from the third
week.

I should note, however, the choice of the starting point of the
reference point is subjective. It doesn’t have rigid rules; everything
depends on the trader’s personal preferences. The trader, however,
should understand why he/she has chosen a particular date.

The reference point is usually the beginning of a [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) month, the
beginning of a trend, or any other period that makes trading sense.

Now, let me explain [how to](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-trading-how-to/) use the horizontal volumes indicator in the
hourly timeframe. (fig. 2). The starting point is the beginning of the
uptrend, Feb 20. As the histogram shows, the maximum trading volume is
around 1.1180.

Below, there is the support level of the longer timeframe, 1.1082, and
1.1002. For the [EURUSD][1] sell trades, these levels can serve as
targets. A stop loss should be above 1.1180. A right stop loss level is
around the high at 1.1216.

Therefore, if you combine the support and resistance levels indicated by
the horizontal volumes with other technical analysis methods, you will
have a more precise market situation. Your analysis will base on not
only technical tools of the price chart analysis but also on the market
liquidity. So, your trading performance will be higher.

In conclusion, I want to answer a reasonable question, where do the
volumes come from if the Forex market does not have a centralized
trading place. There is one little trick here. As a rule, the most
correct will be the so-called real trading volumes in futures contracts
and stocks, but you have to pay for such volumes because real-time data
are quite expensive.

However, instead of real volumes, you can use the so-called tick volume,
which measures the number of price ticks over a specified period. As my
personal experience shows, there is a little difference between real and
tick volumes. So, you can save up time and money.

You can download free horizontal volumes indicator on the [developer
[website](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/website-for-forex-trading/)][2]. Install the horizontal volumes indicator for MT5 or MT4 in
the LiteForex trading terminal and use it. The only limitation of this
method is that the indicator will start calculating the volumes only
from the moment it is installed.

The sooner you install this indicator on your trading chart, the faster
it will help you make money. I wish you good profits. However, remember
the money management rules, as no trading indicator or strategy
guarantees a 100% chance of success!
