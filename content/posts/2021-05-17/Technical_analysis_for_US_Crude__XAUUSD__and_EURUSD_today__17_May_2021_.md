Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 17.05.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

Oil opens a new trading week in a short-term downtrend.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

Oil opens a new trading week in a short-term downtrend. Now, the price
is trading between the Additional Zone and the Intermediary Zone. These
zones together represent the zone of good sell prices, from which it is
profitable to look for a pattern and sell oil with a target at level
63.32.

For oil purchases, the bulls must break out the resistance level of
66.02 and consolidate the price above. In this case, the trend will
reverse up, and the Target Zone 68.94 - 68.41 will become the target for
purchases.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

Open sell positions according to the pattern in 66.02 - 64.43.
TakeProfit: 63.32, Target Zone 61.31 - 60.78. StopLoss: according to the
pattern rules.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

The gold sellers were discouraged last week. As a result, the
Intermediary Zone 1823-1820 was broken out, but the market did not go
down and instead broke out the resistance of 1833-1831. Today, the price
has already reached the Target Zone 1858-1853.

The further trend will depend on the traders' ability to consolidate the
price above the Target Zone. If this happens, the next target will be
the Gold Zone 1878 - 1876.

If the resistance is held, the price will go to the correction with the
first target in the Additional Zone 1844 - 1843.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

  1. Buy according to the pattern in Additional Zone 1844 - 1843. TakeProfit: 1853. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. Buy according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 1832 - 1830. TakeProfit: 1853. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

The trading week starts with the short-term euro downtrend, the target
of which is to test the Target Zone 1.2005 - 1.1988. Last Friday,
traders reached the trend key resistance 1.2148 - 1.2139. The price
didn't break out the zone. Today, look for the euro sales according to
the pattern with the first target at level 1.2062.

Buy EUR/USD only after the trend reversal up. This requires traders to
break out the trend key resistance and consolidate the price at the US
session higher. In this case, the target for purchases will be the upper
Target Zone 1.2245 - 1.2227.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

Sell according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 1.2148 - 1.2139.
TakeProfit: 1.2062, Target Zone 1.2005 - 1.1988. StopLoss: according to
the pattern rules.
