Gold reached green zone. Forecast as of 17.05.2021Dmitri Demidenko

The situation in which the Fed is able to remain patient for a very long
time, and inflation is growing at a rapid pace, is favorable for the
[XAUUSD][1] bulls. How long will this last, and what is the gold's
growth potential? Let us discuss the Forex outlook and make up a gold
trading plan

## Quarterly gold fundamental forecast

Why did the markets ignore inflation throughout Donald Trump's
presidency? Now [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are only talking about accelerating consumer
prices and the core CPI to the highest levels since 2008 and 1996,
respectively. In fact, you need to understand that over the past three
decades, the financial world has existed in a low-inflation environment,
which has affected stocks, bonds, and, of course, gold prices. A
pandemic could become a systemic shock that will change the worldview.

Low inflation allows the printing press to operate at full capacity. The
cheap liquidity flooding financial markets is at the heart of stock
indices and US Treasuries' bullish trends. When the value of Treasuries
rises, their yield falls, creating a favorable environment for the gold.
Almost free money contributed to the emergence of cryptocurrencies,
which some [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s were quick to call an alternative to gold as a
hedge against inflationary risks. However, Bitcoin collapsed after Elon
Musk made several negative comments about the coin. Do you really think
that a tool that depends on the whim of an eccentric billionaire can
protect your savings from inflation?

Of course, the CPI acceleration gives rise to rumors about the Fed's
monetary tightening, which is negative [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) for gold. But at a time when
macro statistics periodically disappoint, and the Fed continues to
declare the temporary nature of the acceleration of consumer prices,
[XAUUSD][1] buyers feel confident. Most importantly, the markets trust
the central bank: inflation expectations over the next five years,
measured using bonds, are 2.65% and 2.37%.

### Dynamics of inflation expectations

Hedge funds and [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/) bulls are well aware that the passivity of the
Federal Reserve and the slow recovery of the US economy from the
pandemic are creating favorable conditions for the precious metal.
Speculative gold net positions have reached more than a 3-month high,
and capital inflows to specialized exchange-traded funds have continued
for six consecutive days.

A favorable environment for gold allows one to wonder if its price will
return above $2,000 per ounce? It is quite possible, although the risks
certainly remain. The main one, in my opinion, is psychology-related.
Goldman Sachs believes that the market is moving from preparing to
accelerate inflation to actually implementing this process. Will
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s who have not seen a 5% CPI since 1991 randomly dump stocks and
bonds, leading to higher Treasury yields and a stronger dollar?

### Quarterly gold trading plan

In my opinion, do what the Fed is doing – remain cool under pressure.
The pandemic has made serious adjustments to macro statistics. In order
to understand what the trend of a particular indicator will be, wait for
six months. I propose to be patient and periodically add up to gold
longs, entered at levels [$1750][2] and [$1800][3] per ounce. The
initial targets are $1905 and $1955.
