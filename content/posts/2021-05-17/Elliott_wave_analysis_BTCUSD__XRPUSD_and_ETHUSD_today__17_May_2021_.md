Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 17.05.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

Bitcoin and Ethereum may soon start rising in corrective waves.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

The BTCUSD market is forming a downtrend. There should be forming the
initial part of the impulse down wave, with waves 1 and 2 completed
inside. Wave 1 is an impulse, wave 2 is a simple zigzag. There should
have finished wave of a smaller degree, impulse [1]. This signals that
there should start an upward correction [2]. The price should be rising
in wave [2] to a level of 55500.00, where it will reach the Fibonacci
ratio of 76.4% of wave [1].

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

The XRPUSD market is forming a long-term horizontal contracting
triangle, composed of the sub-waves (A)-(B)-(C)-(D)-(E). In such kind of
triangles, each next wave is smaller than the previous one. So, wave (B)
is smaller than wave (A). Wave (C) is smaller than wave (B). There is
now unfolding wave (D) which should be smaller than wave (C). Wave (D)
is likely to be 76.4% of the previous wave (C). Wave W has completed in
wave (D), wave X is bout to finish soon. The market is about to start
rising in wave Y to a level of 1.6328, where the entire wave (D) will be
76.4% of wave (C).

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] today:

## Elliott wave Ethereum analysis

The ETHUSD uptrend must have finished. After the red sub-waves 1-2-3-4-5
completed in the blue wave (5), the market has turned down and started
forming a new downtrend. The sub-waves 1 and 2 have been completed.
Next, there started developing the sub-waves of smaller degree [1] and
[2]. Wave [1] has completed, so the market should be rising in the
bullish correction [2] to a level of 3750.00, where wave [2] will be
61.8% of impulse [1]. Therefore, one could enter long trades.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:
