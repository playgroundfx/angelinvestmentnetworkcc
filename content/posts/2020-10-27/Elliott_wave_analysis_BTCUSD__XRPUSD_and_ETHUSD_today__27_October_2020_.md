Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 27.10.2020Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I suggest entry signals
to trade each cryptocurrency.

Bitcoin may soon complete the bullish impulse wave [3], then the market
will experience a correction. Continue watching the cryptocurrency pair.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

 ****

In the last section of the chart, we see a bullish impulse wave C
developing, it consists of sub-waves [1]-[2]-[3]-[4]-[5]. An impulse
wave [3] is now developing. At the moment, sub-waves (1)-(2)-(3)-(4)
look fully completed, and wave (5) has just begun to form. In the near
future, [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) may rise to the level of 13760, where the final part of
the impulse [3] will be located, after that I expect a slight corrective
decline in wave [4], as shown in the chart.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 13120.25, TP 13760.00

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

 ****

An upward corrective wave B is developing. It is a triple zigzag
consisting of sub-waves [W]-[X]-[Y]-[X]-[Z]. The final part of this
zigzag, wave [Z], may take the form of a double combination. Now the
price is going down in the last impulse from the zigzag linking wave
(x). In the near future, I expect the decline to be completed, then the
actionary wave (y) may rise towards the level of 0.273. Consider opening
longs.

### Trading plan for **[XRPUSD][2]** today:

Buy 0.248, TP 0.273

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

 ****

Within the downward simple zigzag, corrective wave B is developing, it
takes the form of a double zigzag [W]-[X]-[Y], where sub-waves [W] and
[X] are already fully completed and wave [Y] is not yet completed. It is
longer than the first two sub-waves and has a simple zigzag structure
(A)-(B)-(C). Perhaps the corrective wave [4] which is part of the
bullish impulse 5 of (C), has been completed - this is a signal for a
rise in wave [5]. It is likely that the cryptocurrency pair will reach
the level of 443.00

### Trading plan for  **[ETHUSD][3] **today:

Buy 392.85, TP 443.00
