The yen returns home. Analysis as of 27.10.2020Dmitri Demidenko

Japanese [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s’ high demand for US stocks used to limit the
potential of the yen’s consolidation. In 2020, much has changed, though.
How will that affect the [USDJPY][1]? Let’s discuss that and make a
trading plan.

## Monthly fundamental forecast for yen

The Japanese yen has been slowly consolidating for a few past years,
making me think that we are living in turbulent times.

Trade wars, pandemic, and recession maintain high demand for safe-haven
assets. So, it’s not surprising that the [USDJPY][1] have fallen almost
by 8% in the past three years. It’s the second-best result among the G10
currencies after the franc. Also, there’s a substantial gap between the
yen and the third-[ranking](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/crypto-exchange-ranking/) euro, with its +1.8%.

The yen has played the role of the main safe-haven asset for a long
time. It felt confident amid its proximity to China and China’s problems
related to the trade war. [USDJPY][1] bears’ most vulnerable spots were
the BoJ’s ultra-soft monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) and capital outflows amid the local
assets’ low investment appeal. In 2020, the situation went the other way
round: the Fed’s sharp cut of the federal funds rate allowed the dollar
to reclaim its status of the most reliable asset, while the global
market’s yield fall results in the Japanese money repatriation and the
yen’s consolidation.

The high correlation between the [USDJPY][1] and the [S&P 500][2] used
to be due to Japanese residents’ unhedged buying of US stocks. The local
debt market’s rates were low or negative, the [Nikkei 225][3]’s
investment appeal was doubtful, and hedging costs were high. As a
result, Japanese insurance companies and pension funds led by Government
Pension Investment Fund, or GPIF, were looking for investment
opportunities outside the country. A large fiscal stimulus flattens out
bond yields worldwide, drops the cost of foreign currency hedging to the
5-year bottom, and makes hedging conditional on implied volatility’s
exceeding its historic analog.

So, Japanese [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s would buy American stocks without hedging risks,
but now they’ve got such an opportunity. That lowers the pair’s
correlation with the [S&P 500][2] and doesn’t allow speaking about the
yen’s weakness in the economic recovery period.

Capital flows are now directed to Asia. It’s not only about flatter
yields but also about the growth in demand for Japanese stocks. In the
week ended 9 November, non-residents invested ¥1.42 trillion in Japanese
shares, which is the highest value over the past 18 months. They may
have been influenced by Warren Buffet’s intention to buy local
retailers’ securities, or by high demand for mergers and a low share of
foreigners in the market structure.

### Monthly trading plan for [ **USDJPY**][1] ****

Add here GPIF’s limit on foreign assets buying, and we’ll see that
capital flows are reversing in Asia's direction. That circumstance
allows me to sell the [USDJPY][1] with targets at 103 and 102 if Joe
Biden wins the US presidential election, which will most likely weaken
the USD.
