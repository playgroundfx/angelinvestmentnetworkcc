Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 04.10.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

Ethereum and Bitcoin are forming middle sub-waves in bullish impulses.
Ripple is developing the final motive wave in the double zigzag.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

The BTCUSD market must be forming a large corrective wave [B] composed
of three major sub-waves (A)-(B)-(C). The hourly timeframe displays the
final part of the bullish impulse (A) and corrective wave (B), completed
as a zigzag A-B-C. There is forming the upward wave (C) as an impulse
1-2-3-4-5. So far, this impulse has been half-completed. The price could
go up to a level of 50379.41, where impulse wave 3 completed. Next,
following a short correction 4, the market could go up in wave 5 as
outlined in the chart.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 47437.50, TP 50379.41

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

 ****

The XRPUSD market completed the linking wave (X) in early September.
Next, the price started declining in the new corrective wave. There must
be forming the double zigzag W-X-Y. The motive wave W seems to have
completed as a zigzag [A]-[B]-[C]. There is forming the bullish linking
wave X as a double zigzag [W]-[X]-[Y]. The motive wave [Y] should finish
as a double zigzag at a level of 1.200. Next, the price will go down in
wave Y. At level 1.200, wave X will retrace wave W by 61.8%.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] **** today:

Buy 1.033, TP 1.200

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

The ETHUSD market is forming the corrective wave B as a simple zigzag
[A]-[B]-[C]. Impulse [A] and a zigzag-shaped correction [B] must have
completed. There is unfolding the upward impulse wave [C]. The third leg
of the [C] wave, sub-wave (3) could complete at a level of 3675.74. One
could enter buy trades with a target around the above-indicated level.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Buy 3328.21, TP 3675.74
