Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 04.10.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

After reaching level 1.1565, the euro is trading in the upward
correction and testing the Additional Zone 1.1611 - 1.1606.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

On Monday morning, the short-term oil uptrend continues. Its target is
the resistance level of 76.41. If it is broken out, then the next target
will be the Target Zone 78.59 - 78.08.

Now buyers are trying to break out the zone of 75.79 - 75.53, which
prevents the price from rising. If this zone is held during the day, the
oil price decline that began last week will continue and the September
30 low will be updated.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

Open sell positions according to the pattern in 75.79 - 75.53.
TakeProfit: 73.43. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

After updating the September 30 high, the gold price went into
correction. Now XAU is approaching the Additional Zone 1755 - 1754.
After the test of the zone, first of all, look for gold purchases
according to the pattern with the target at today's high.

If the Additional Zone is broken out, then the correction will continue
with the target in the Intermediary Zone 1745 - 1743. Look for purchases
in this support zone because the trend is up.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

Buy according to the pattern in Additional Zone 1755 - 1754. TakeProfit:
1765. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

After reaching level 1.1565, the euro is trading in the upward
correction and testing the Additional Zone 1.1611 - 1.1606. If the
Additional Zone is held, the downtrend will continue and last week's low
will be updated.

However, if buyers have enough funds to break out the Additional Zone
upside, the correction will continue in the Intermediary Zone 1.1659 -
1.1650.

After testing the Intermediary Zone, watch for market reaction. The
further fate of the EUR/USD trend will depend on this reaction.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

  1. Sell according to the pattern in Additional Zone 1.1611 - 1.1606. TakeProfit:  1.1565. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. If the Additional Zone 1.1611 - 1.1606 is broken out and the price consolidates higher, buy from the level of 1.1608. TakeProfit: Intermediary Zone 1.1659 - 1.1650. StopLoss: 1.1596.
