Four benefits of greenback. Forecast as of 04.10.2021Dmitri Demidenko

The [EURUSD][1] downtrend looks really strong, and nobody wants to buy
now. Furthermore, the US dollar could have new benefits soon. Let us
discuss the Forex outlook and make up a trading plan.

## Monthly US dollar fundamental forecast

Financial markets could be moving in the same direction longer than
anyone can imagine and then turn sharply when no one expects. The euro-
area inflation growth to 3.4% in September, the highest value over the
past 13 years, Treasury yield drop, and the US stock indexes rally
should have encouraged the [EURUSD][1] bulls. However, the bullish
attacks look rather weak. The greenback can get new benefits, in
addition to the existing ones.

Along with the expectations of the start of the Fed monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
normalization and high demand for safe-haven assets, the US dollar can
be supported by the return of the American exclusivity factor to the
markets. While [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s continue to worry that Evergrande's troubles
will slow down the Chinese economy and press down global GDP, US
domestic data look quite optimistic. US economic surprise index is
higher than the euro-area one, which is another driver of the
[EURUSD][1] downtrend.

US consumer expenditures growth rate increased from 0.1% to 0.8% M-o-M
in August. Bank of America customer credit and debit card data show it
was 19.8% higher in the last week of September than two years ago. For
comparison, according to the results of the last week of summer, the
indicator increased by 10.1%. The growth in consumer spending is
facilitated by a decrease in the number of COVID-19 cases in the USA
from 161,000 new cases per day in August to 106,000 at the end of
September. Rising consumer expenditures are a sure sign that weak
economic data in the third quarter will be followed by the US GDP growth
in the fourth one. Along with the problems of China's and global
economies, this factor will strengthen the greenback.

It should be noted that the epidemiological situation also affects
employment growth. Bloomberg experts predict that by the end of
September, the US employment growth will accelerate to 488,000, which is
twice as much as at the end of the summer and is quite enough for the
Fed to start scaling back the QE in November.

Another greenback advantage could be the return of the trade wars topic.
It has been a long time since Joe Biden took office as the US President,
but his administration has not yet announced its [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) towards China.
They should do this in early October. Washington will hardly cancel the
tariffs imposed by Donald Trump on $ 370 billion of China's imports. The
latter, by the way, did not fulfill its obligations on purchases of US
products by 40% in 2020 and, most likely, will not do so in 2021.
Therefore, the trade conflict could well be escalated, strengthening the
greenback.

### Monthly [EURUSD][1] trading plan

Therefore, the [EURUSD][1] should continue falling. The downtrend has
not been exhausted, and it is still relevant to sell the pair on the
corrections or at the breakout of the support at 1.156. The downside
target is 1.145.
