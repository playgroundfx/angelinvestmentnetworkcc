S&P 500 is on the rise. Forecast as of 04.10.2021Dmitri Demidenko

A lot depends on the [S&P 500][1]. It shows [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s' risk appetite and
reflects the strength of the US economy. The position of emerging-market
currencies also depends on the index. What's next for the US stock
market in 2022? Let us discuss the market outlook and make up a trading
plan.

## Fundamental S&P 500 forecast for a year

The [S&P 500][1]'s September fall (almost 5%) is the worst since March
2020. It has cast doubt on the strategy of unrestrained buying of US
stocks in the absence of other alternatives. It is obvious that 2022 for
the S&P 500 will not be as good as 2021, because many of the bullish
factors have already been taken into account. Is there a serious
correction in the stock market or will it get off with just a fright?
Will small corrections continue to attract buyers?

Fed's cheap liquidity, a booming US economic recovery, impressive
corporate profits and low debt market rates are the main drivers of the
[S&P 500][1]'s rally (more than 15%) since the beginning of the year.
The rapid rise in debt market rates at the end of September was the main
driver of S&P 500 correction, as [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s gradually realize that low
bond yields can no longer serve as a safety cushion for stocks.

Liquidity flows decline, as well as the QE tapering, are expected in
2022. The economy is returning to its normal state. It will absorb more
money than before. The balances, including in the form of reinvestment
by the central bank of income from the securities to be redeemed, will
continue to flow to the stock market.

Despite the potential acceleration of US GDP in the fourth quarter after
an unimpressive third, the US economy can hardly be expected to grow
3-4% next year. It will affect corporate profits along with high prices,
supply chain problems and labor shortages. The profits will no longer be
huge, but they will continue to grow. This is good [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) for the [S&P
500][1]. History shows that the index never fell when the financial
performance of companies improved.

### Dynamics of the [S&P 500][1] and earnings per share

 _Source: Nordea Markets._

Treasury yields are likely to continue to go up. However, opinions on
this matter were divided. After an impressive rise in the last decade of
September, some [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s felt that reaching the 2% mark on 10-year
securities was a done deal. Others, on the other hand, are not sure if
the rally will continue. They argue that when the Fed's neutral rate is
below 2%, it is difficult to expect yields to be substantially higher.
You need to understand that firstly, higher borrowing costs are negative
for stocks, as they reduce profits. Secondly, they have a positive
effect, as they indicate the strength of the US economy.

Thus, less liquidity, lower growth rates of US GDP and corporate
profits, and higher debt rates suggest that, firstly, the [S&P 500][1]
will not be able to rise by 15% in 2022. Secondly, the volatility of the
stock index will be significantly higher than in 2021. As a result, the
previous strategy to buy as soon as the price fell slightly will be
ineffective.

### [S&P 500][1] trading plan for a year

Over the 12-month investment horizon, I expect a wide 4150 - 4650
trading range in the [S&P 500][1] and recommend looking closely at
cyclical stocks in the fourth quarter and sales of tech stocks if US
Treasury yields rise.
