Google stock forecast: 2021 and BeyondJana Kane

Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) is the winner of the internet and has many
exciting innovations. Google Cloud is also rapidly gaining ground. More
and more people are using the internet, and Google is the #1 search
engine. The company manages to rake in a lot of money with
advertisements, among other things.

The article covers the following subjects:

What is the future of Google? This article discusses the tech giant’s
latest quarterly revenue and looks at the [Google stock][1] price
prediction.

## Google (Alphabet): Recent Price History

Despite the coronavirus crisis, sales in 2020 increased by more than
12.7% to $182 billion. Earnings were up 17.2% to $40.27 billion. This
strong growth still justifies the somewhat higher valuation (P/E) of the
company. A positive development is also that the turnover is
increasingly better distributed over different divisions. In 2018,
Google Services (chiefly advertisements) still accounted for almost 96%
of the total turnover. In 2019 this share fell to below 94%, and in 2020
this division still accounted for 92.4% of the turnover.

This development is mainly due to the strong growth of Google Cloud. In
2020, sales increased by 46% to $13.05 billion. However, Alphabet
invests and innovates independently and tries to conquer more of the
market share quickly.

The Other Bets division faced an operating loss of $4.47 billion in
2020, but this loss now appears to be declining. Also, the
commercialization of some important products seems to be getting closer.
Recently, Alphabet announced that Ford and Google are going to work
together. Ford will purchase cloud services from Google, among other
things, and the companies will also share knowledge in data processing,
AI, and machine learning.

### Why Alphabet?

Google started as early as 1996 as a research project of Larry Page and
Sergey Brin, who studied together at Stanford University. The students
invented a system in which servers searched the internet and sorted it
according to the user’s search query. They called this system PageRank.
They initially called their search engine BackRub but later changed it
to Google, which was officially founded in 1998.

In 2004 and 2006, respectively, the Google stock was listed on major US
indices Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500. Google’s IPO was incredibly successful
after initial skepticism due to the collapsed internet bubble. Since the
Google stock was $85 per share, the price has risen by approximately
2367%.

The company now is much more than just a search engine. A few years ago,
Google decided to place the various activities in one holding: Alphabet,
which now owns more than 400 different companies. Since 2015, Google has
been a subsidiary of the parent company Alphabet. We can split
Alphabet’s business into two parts: Google LLC & Other Bets.

Google LCC is the company behind the Google search engine. Other
important activities under this branch are Android, YouTube, Google
Cloud, and Google Ads.

### Other Bets

Other Bets are all other activities that are often not really profitable
yet but are hopeful for the future. Alphabet has been investing part of
the advertising income in new projects.

One of Alphabet’s best-known projects is perhaps Waymo, better known as
“Google Driverless Car.” Test drives have been performed since 2015.
Earlier this year, Waymo raised another $2.25 billion from outside
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s. With the capital raised, the company intends to further
invest in its personnel and technology to make self-driving cars a
success.

### Google Cloud Platform (GPC)

Google’s parent company has also decided to take significant steps in
the Cloud. A lot of money is made in that branch, and Alphabet cannot,
of course, lag behind competitors. GCP provides solutions for storage,
analytics, big data, machine learning, and app development.

## Google Stock Technical Analysis

First, we'll do technical analysis of the Google stock on the monthly
timeframe.

There's been a stable bullish trend since the beginning of 2015. The
growth of trading activity confirms an uptrend's big potential.

The intensity of Google shares' ascending movement increased
significantly last year. Unsurprisingly, IT may be the only sector that
took advantage of the pandemic and global lockdown. However, growth that
fast overheats the market.

The pandemic will end sooner or later, and the fundamental picture will
no longer be so favorable. However paradoxical this may sound, people
getting back to the office may finally prevent Google stock from growing
further and become a reason for correction. Other indirect signals of
Google's future fall are:

No signs of the global bullish trend's reversal. That means the most
realistic forecast is that a short-term correction movement will
develop.

### Google stock forecast for next three months

Three-month predictions for GOOG stock will be based on the weekly
chart.

RSI values indirectly confirm the Google stock's projected fall. A
resistance level, from which RSI retraced at the end of April 2021, was
formed in the overbought area in January 2020 (the green line in the
indicator's window).

Considering those factors, I doubt that the indicator will retest that
level shortly. At the same time, I have to mention typical bearish
divergence that occurred in 2020 when RSI moves didn't confirm an update
of maximums in the price chart.

Divergence would also be a powerful bearish call and confirmation of a
correction signal in the current situation. Still, don't forget that the
price has to test or even update [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) maximums for divergence to
happen.

So, the likeliest scenario for the next three months is an update of the
[historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) high with a target at 2,500 – 2,550, subsequent savage
correction, and reaching a psychological level of 2,000 US dollars in
August. Those will be decisive factors in the development of
[Google][2]'s potential.

If the Google price chart crosses the dotted trend line and consolidates
below 2,000 USD, i.e. breaks an ascending trading channel, the next
projected price target will be approaching the main trend line at 1,200
- 1,250 USD. In that case, the prospects of a price fall will be
interesting enough for us to open short-term short positions.

 ****

The current likeliest scenario is that market correction will start
after [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) maximums have been updated, with August's target at the
lower limit of the bullish trading channel. Then, an upward movement
will resume.

A breakout of the level of 2,000 USD is a less likely scenario. That's a
strong psychological level where the price has consolidated during three
months in 2021. A breakout will be a solid bearish signal of the local
trend's reversal. Technical analysis hasn't provided any trend reversal
signals so far.

There's another scenario that can't be neglected: the price might be
moving along the green resistance line at 2,450 as it did from November
2020 up to January and from February to March 2021. The same fractal is
unlikely to repeat itself three times in a row, so that scenario
shouldn't be taken as the main one.

### GOOG Stock Technical Analysis for 2021

Let's continue our technical analysis in the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) chart and try to
predict how Google stock price will behave in 2021.

Let's study the Google stock's price [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) and do analysis using
[Bollinger Bands](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/bollinger-bands.html). Then, we'll use those data to draw projections for each
month.

The price is currently located near the upper limit of the bullish
channel. Buyers are under big pressure. The level of 2,550 USD limits an
ascending movement. The price is unlikely to cross it. [GOOG][2]
projected value will most likely go from 2,000 USD to 2,450 USD most of
the year. Two critical events, which may affect the technical chart's
further movement, should be expected.

The first one may happen from August to October when the price will be
located near the lower limit of the trend channel or even cross it for a
short time. The chart will most likely pull back from the support level
later and continue moving upwards.

The other critical event will occur at the end of 2021 or the beginning
of 2022, when the prediction chart will either cross the all-time high
and continue a bullish movement or retrace from it and go flat for a
long time.

The table below presents an expected Google trading range for each
month.

## How Did the Price of Google Stock Change Over Time? Historical Price.

Many [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s analyze [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) data and use it in their stock trading
strategy to make more realistic and reliable GOOGL share price
predictions.

## Factors that Can Affect the Google Stock Price

### №1 - Google global marketing strategy

Since 2015, Google has been integrated as a company in the Alphabet
group. This new organizational structure allows Google to continue to
focus on its main activities, which are related to web users’ habits.
Therefore, it can target its investments in research and development and
its global marketing strategy, more specifically, without being
disturbed by external elements.

### №2 - Sales & New products launches

Still, in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of future possibilities, the Google group can also take
advantage of tablets and smartphones’ current growth, for which strong
demand should continue to increase next year. In 2018 alone, more than
1.7 smartphones would be sold worldwide, according to sector
specialists; most of them will, of course, be equipped with the Android
operating system. If the development of these projects will be
successful, the stock price will rise.

### №3 - Google platforms development

Google exposes itself to various risks in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of searches from
particular applications. More and more users are now using specific
applications to perform their online searches. This poses a real danger
to Google’s search engine and can have significant consequences for its
traffic. These types of software and applications are conquering more
and more market share from the web giant.

### №4 - Courts and administrative risks

Another threat to be aware of is administrative procedures that can
damage the image of the Google brand. Google overcame allegations of
abuse of power a few years ago. This concerned certain practices
denounced by the European Commission, such as the fact that Google
deliberately ranked highly competitive results lower in the search
results.

### №5 - Local & Global competitors

A final threat to consider when making a fundamental analysis concerns
the very tough competition in this business sector. Google managed to
fend off competition from different players; however, it is still
obliged to maintain its market share through innovation with various
products and services. After all, many new companies try to position
themselves in search engines and social networks in innovative ways.

## Are Google (Alphabet) Stocks a Good Investment?

Alphabet (GOOGL) is an outstanding stock. The company has a rock-solid
balance sheet, and net profit last year, in 2020, was over $40.2
billion. With a stock market value of $1,365 billion and a net profit of
$40.2 billion, we arrive at a P/E of 34. At first glance, the share
seems a bit pricey, but it is not so bad due to the strong revenue
growth. The expected P/E for 2021 is 30 and even 27 for 2022, with a net
profit of $50 billion.

Not bad, but we can also value the stock differently. Without the losses
of Google Cloud and Other Bets, earnings would be about 11 billion
higher at $52 billion. Alphabet also sits on a mountain of $136 billion.
If we subtract this from the stock market value and add back the debt of
$14 billion, we get an Enterprise Value of $1,243 billion. The Google
