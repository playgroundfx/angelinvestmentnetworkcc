Dollar has no crib sheet. Forecast as of 03.06.2021Dmitri Demidenko

Patterns are as well used in fundamental analysis as in technical
analysis. Unfortunately, the current post-recession recovery is unique.
It doesn't have any analogs and, therefore, any behavior [algorithms](https://www.fintechee.com/algorithms-for-trading/). How
will it affect the [EURUSD][1]? Let’s check it out and make a trading
plan.

## Fundamental forecast for dollar for today

It's good to have a crib sheet in your pocket and check it every time
you aren't sure of your opinion. By “crib sheet”, I mean any precedents
established in the past. If there haven't been any similar events in
[history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) before, one might get nervous. The collapse and the subsequent
boom that we have seen recently don't have any analogs, and [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s
don't know where to look. The market is governed by fear, so we just
need to get used to the [EURUSD][1]'s roller-coaster that has occurred
in the past three out of four Forex trading sessions.

The US labor market recovery after recessions in 1990-1991, 2001, and
2007-2009 was followed by weak demand. That prompted workforce
reductions and kept unemployment high for many years. Unsurprisingly,
economists and politicians predicted last year that the labor market
would require much time to recover. However, employment rates have grown
by 1.8 million since the beginning of 2021. The indicator misses 8.2
million to reach pre-recession levels. At the same time, Dallas Fed
estimates that 2.6 million workers have retired and will never get back
to work.

The same concerns inflation. Markets don't know if we are going back to
the 70ies for real or we should trust the Fed, believing a PCE boost is
temporary. April's growth of the index for personal consumption
expenditures to 3.6% was impressive, but cutting off the extreme values
-- the sectors where inflation increased much, such as used car sales --
will show a completely different picture.

We'll see that inflation hasn't affected the whole economy. So, why
should Fed want to fight it?

I think the [EURUSD][1]'s fluctuations are connected with the fear of
uncertainty. The current post-recession economic recovery doesn't have
[historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) analogs, and [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s don't know [how to](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-trading-how-to/) behave. The
situation might get worse in the near time when more and more people
start wondering what the Fed will do in the presence of strong US
macrostatistics. Will it abandon its [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of tolerance?

May's US labor market report may become decisive. If labor stats are
weak, Treasury bond yields and the USD rate may fall, as they did a
month ago, expecting that the Fed will continue an easy money [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) for
a long time as the economy still needs support. But what if the stats
are good and the employment rates growth exceeds Bloomberg experts’
consensus forecast of 650 thousand? Will the [EURUSD][1] correct? Or
have USD quotes already included all positive factors, so only bad [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/)
may prompt significant fluctuations?

### Trading plan for [EURUSD][1] for today

So, we’ll know the answer soon. The [EURUSD][1] consolidates in the
range of 1.217-1.225 ahead of the important release, and I would wait
for it. My advice would be staying off the market.
