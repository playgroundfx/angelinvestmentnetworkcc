Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 03.06.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

Yesterday, an oil buy pattern yielded profits and the price updated its
June 1 local high.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

Yesterday, an oil buy pattern yielded profits and the price updated its
June 1 local high. The next target within the short-term uptrend is the
Gold Zone 69.73 - 69.46. If the Gold Zone is broken out, then the growth
will continue, and the target will be Target Zone 2 72.64 - 72.11.

If the price does not break out the GZ, then expect a correction. A
correction is an opportunity to consider new purchases according to the
pattern.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

  1. Buy according to the pattern in Additional Zone 67.94 - 67.81. TakeProfit: 69.25. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. Buy according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 66.62 - 66.35. TakeProfit: 69.25. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

The gold traders have held the short-term uptrend's key support
1894-1889. However, the price is now falling and set to retest the
support. Currently, it is unprofitable to buy gold, because there is a
risk of a trend reversal.

Today, watch the retest of the Intermediary Zone 1894 - 1891. In case of
a false breakout of yesterday's low, enter gold purchases. In case of
level 1889 breakout, sell gold with a target at the lower Target Zone
1871 - 1867.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

Watch the market.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

A short-term euro downtrend continues. Its first target is the test of
level 1.2134, the second is the test of the Target Zone 1.2090 - 1.2072.

Yesterday, an impulse was formed from the Intermediary Zone 1.2229 -
1.2220. As part of the impulse, a support level of 1.2173 was indicated,
from which the price rebounded. If this level is broken out today, a
“1-2-3” sell pattern will form.

If instead of falling, the euro begins to strengthen and, as a result,
the Intermediary Zone is broken out, the short-term trend will reverse
up. In this case, cancel all sales and enter purchases with a target at
the upper Target Zone 1.2326 - 1.2308.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

Sell according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 1.2229 - 1.2220.
TakeProfit: 1.2134, Target Zone 1.2090 - 1.2072. StopLoss: according to
the pattern rules.
