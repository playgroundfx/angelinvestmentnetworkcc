XOM Stock Forecast: The Future of Oil and Gas in the Green Energy
EraJana Kane

For many years, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s didn’t have to worry much about the Exxon
Mobil Corp, mainly thanks to the company’s consistently large profits.
But now there are at least two things that are making some [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s
nervous — the demand for clean energy infrastructure and the global
economic slowdown.

The oil giant seems to be slow to react to changes in the energy
landscape, having shown very little interest in investing in renewable
energy up until recently. For the first time in 2021, [Exxon][1]
disclosed the emissions from its products and created a business unit
for carbon emissions-reducing technologies. The question is: will it be
enough?

And in reaction to plummeting fossil-fuel demand, Exxon slashed its
planned capital spending by about a third and cut as much as 15% of its
workforce. Once again: will this improve the firm’s financial outlook?

We’ll find the answers in the numbers. In this article, we’ll be looking
at [XOM][2] stock forecasts to gauge what analyst recommendations and
various publications say about the company’s future. How will Exxon
behave in the short term? How much will Exxon stock be in 10 years?
Learn more about Exxon Mobil stock's future below.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Overview of the XOM Inc. Stock

[Exxon Mobil Corporation][3] is the largest United States corporation in
the oil sector and one of the world’s largest companies by revenue
overall.

 ****

Exxon explores, produces, transports, and sells crude oil and natural
gas. The company also manufactures and markets commodity petrochemicals,
such as olefins, aromatics, polyethylene, and other specialty products.

Here is a short summary for the stock (as of May 26, 2021):

  * Market cap: $246.65 billion

  * Shares outstanding: 4.23 billion

  * Public float: 4.23 billion

  * Earnings per share: -$4.47

  * Yield: 5.95%

  * Dividend: $0.87

  * Ex-dividend date: May 12, 2021

  * Percentage of float shorted: 0.87%

  * Average volume: 27.52 million

The current price for one XOM share is 61.16 USD.

Technically, the company was created in 1999 through the merger of Exxon
(the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey) and Mobil (the Standard Oil
Company of New York). But XOM shares were publicly available long before
then.

Over the course of its [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/), XOM stock split five times.

As you can see, ExxonMobil splits took place at regular intervals. There
could have been another split during the 2007 stock crash, but the oil
bust occurred before Exxon could pull the trigger.

## What Will Drive Exxon’s Price in 2021 and Beyond?

In short, the Exxon stock forecast is heavily affected by the supply and
demand for petroleum-based products, companies' earnings expectations
vs. reported results, and global events.

There are also discussions of a mega-merger between ExxonMobil and
Chevron. The two companies would then produce about 14% of American
petroleum and other similar petrochemicals. If regulators choose to
approve a Chexxon merger, the [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) could make the stock quote skyrocket.

There is one important factor and its effect on the price projection is
something that we want to highlight separately. It’s the ongoing global
shift toward low carbon energy [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/).

There is an ongoing fear that oil and natural gas will start falling out
of use, but with this, timing is key. The shift to solar and wind power
will be too slow to move Exxon out of the picture, solidifying oil- and
natural gas-based stock for quite some time.

But the stock also depends on a positive public image. That’s why the
ExxonMobil Low Carbon Solutions business was launched. The realistic
goal was set to develop innovative, large-scale carbon capture and
storage (CCS) concepts. If carbon neutrality ambitions are met
successfully over the next several decades, the stock price should not
be disrupted by environmentally conscious regulators and activists.

## XOM Price Predictions for 2021: Analysts’ Ratings

Exxon Mobil to $64 from $60. When boosting the price target, he did not

concerns as it strives to reduce emissions and advance low carbon
technology.

## Technical Analysis of the Exxon Stock

Please bear in mind that Exxon Mobil stock predictions for 2025 and
beyond are only estimations. Even with the [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) accuracy we have
from past performance, it should be noted that the stock market can
surprise [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s with large spikes and drastic price drops.

## Recent Performance of the XOM Price

It would be impossible to fit the entire price [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) of the Exxon
Mobil Corporation into our brief report. Over the last 15 years alone,
the [XOM][2] stock has been on an irregular run — the price could surge
to over $100 and then dip below $40. But for now, let’s take a deeper
look into the past year’s timeline.

Why is Exxon's stock down in the beginning of 2020? The fall started
after reported fiscal year earnings missed expectations at the end of
2019. Not only did the quarterly numbers look bad, annual figures did
too. Within a month, the stock dropped from $70 to almost $60.

ExxonMobil’s 2020 plunge was made worse by an all-out oil price war
between Saudi Arabia and Russia in early March of the same year. And, of
course, the pandemic crushed energy demand, not making things any easier
for the sector. All these factors combined made US crude fall to a
negative value for the first time in [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/). Exxon's lowest point of
the year was on March 23 at $30.11.

Despite briefly climbing over the $50 mark in the beginning of June, the
stock fell to $32 by the end of October. Overall, according to Bloomberg
data, Exxon’s loss in market value was one of the worst among US firms
in 2020.

Slowly but surely, the company started to recover. During the first
quarter of 2021, Exxon earned $2.7 billion, which is strong evidence of
recovery. And in the last 6 months, the stock showed a rise from around
$30 to almost $60 per share.

## Conclusion: What Does the Future Hold for XOM?

Is it good to invest in Exxon? Continuous future growth is a
possibility, but you may be more interested in learning how much of a
gain to expect. Let’s round up all the short- and long-term predictions
we’ve covered in this article in one Exxon Mobil stock price forecast.
