Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 03.06.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

All three cryptocurrencies are gradually approaching the estimated price
levels.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

There is developing the beginning of the downward impulse. Currently,
only its first sub-wave is fully completed which is the five-wave
impulse [1], consisting of five sub-waves (1) - (2) - (3) - (4) - (5).
An upward correction [2] is unfolding as well, which may take the form
of a double zigzag (W) - (X) - (Y). The first two parts of this zigzag,
sub-waves (W) and (X), can be seen. The unfolding of the last active
sub-wave (Y) is expected, the internal structure of which also resembles
a double zigzag. In the current situation, enter long trades to take
profit at the level of 44500.00. At this level, wave [2] will be 50% of
wave [1], so the probability of reaching the specified ratio is high.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 37882.00, TP 44500.00

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

A corrective pattern is currently unfolding. Most likely, it will take
the form of a double zigzag (W) - (X) - (Y). So far, only the first
active wave (W) in the form of a zigzag has been completed. A linking
wave (X) is in the process of development, which can take the form of a
simple zigzag A-B-C. The last impulse wave C is assumed to have
completed the first four parts and the last fifth is currently
developing. Soon, the XRPUSD price may move within wave [5] to the level
of 1.300, so consider entering long trades.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] today:

Buy 1.025, TP 1.300

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

The ETHUSD market is forming the initial part of a large bear impulse,
the first impulse wave of which has been completed. An upward corrective
wave 2 is currently unfolding. This correction is taking the form of a
simple zigzag [A] - [B] - [C]. It seems that the market is currently
developing a corrective wave (4), which will end soon. Hereafter, the
market may rise within the final wave (5) towards level 3340.00. At this
level, wave 2 will be 61.8% of wave 1.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Buy 2747.50, TP 3340.00
