Europe will dance a ‘twist’. Forecast for USDHUF, USDPLN, and USDCZK as
of 23.11.2020Dmitri Demidenko

The euro bullish forecasts are clear. Which currency units should
perform better than the regional currency in 2021? Let us discuss this
question and make up a trading plan for [USDHUF][1], [USDPLN][2], and
[USDCZK][3].

##  **Fundamental forecast for the Hungarian forint, Polish zloty, and
Czech koruna for six months**

The global economic recovery will hardly be fast and easy; however, it
won’t be canceled because of the huge money flows injected into the
financial system, mostly due to the Fed. The Fed’s massive monetary
expansion has weakened the US dollar and helped the rest of the world.
The good [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) about COVID-19 vaccines and the talks that the Fed’s
officials are willing to correct the QE in December support the emerging
markets’ currencies. These currencies had been growing for three
consecutive weeks in the week ended November 20; the implied volatility
dropped to the lowest level over the last four months.

Since most Forex trade operations are carried out in the [EURUSD][4],
inventors’ demand for the pair is understandable. However, one can make
money in Forex trading other currencies as well. Euro is growing versus
the US dollar, but the trade-weighted EUR is declining, which means the
emerging markets’ currencies are stronger than earlier. If the EURUSD
bullish forecast, suggesting a rally at least to 1.25 in 2021, come
true, the other European currencies could be more promising than the
euro, as it was in 2017.

According to Goldman Sachs, emerging markets can outperform the rest of
the world in 2021 amid the lower US political uncertainty, mass
vaccination, and global GDP recovery. BlackRock, JP Morgan, and Morgan
Stanley suggest the same forecasts. I would add lower geopolitical risks
as another reason to buy EM assets. These factors will support the
global risk appetite and decrease the volatility, which provides good
opportunities for carry trades. Besides, the launch of the Fed’s
‘operation twist in December’ will support the demand for EM currencies.

The Federal Reserve first launched this program in September 2011. It
provided for the purchase of Treasuries with a maturity of 6-30 years
for $ 400 billion with the simultaneous sale of Treasury bonds with
maturities of 1 to 3 years. ‘Twist’ was aimed at keeping long-term bond
yields low. This, on the one hand, supports the economy. On the other
hand, ‘twist’ in operations creates a favorable environment for carry
trades. As [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) proves, the fast growth of the US debt market rates
is a bad sign for the emerging markets’ currencies, and vice versa.

### Trading plan for [USDHUF][1], [USDPLN][2], and [USDCZK][3] for six
months

AS a rule, the global economic recovery lays a foundation for monetary
normalization. The interest rate hikes in Hungary, Poland, and the Czech
Republic should occur sooner than in the euro-area, which faces
deflation. This fact, together with the favorable foreign environment
and the support from carry traders, suggests selling the [USDHUF][1],
[USDPLN][2], and [USDCZK][3] with the target at 292 and 286, 3.69 and
3.61, 21.59 and 20.84, correspondingly on the investment horizons of
three and six months.
