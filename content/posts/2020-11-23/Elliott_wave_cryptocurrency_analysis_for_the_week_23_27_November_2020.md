Medium-term forecast for five cryptocurrencies as of 23.11.2020Roman
Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a medium-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, EOS, and Ripple. I offer
trading signals for each cryptocurrency pair.

The most recent chart sections of the major cryptocurrencies display the
uptrends. Let us study the situation in more detail for each
cryptocurrency pair.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

 ****

The [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) timeframe of the BTCUSD price chart displays that, after the
bullish impulse 3 ended, the market has started forming corrective wave
4 as a double zigzag [W]-[X]-[Y]. The price is currently rising in the
linking wave [X], which is a double combination (W)-(X)-(Y). The first
two parts of the combination have formed, and the final zigzag (Y) is
still unfolding. Let us explore the structure of wave (Y) at the eight-
hour timeframe.

The final wave (Y) of the double zigzag [X] is composed of the sub-waves
A-B-C, it is a simple zigzag. Wave A is a bullish impulse, corrective
wave B is a contracting horizontal triangle. Wave C is also an impulse,
with the sub-wave [4] forming inside. Therefore, the price could go down
a little in correction [4]. Next, the market should resume rising in
wave [5] to a level of 20000.00.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] for the week:

Buy 18499.00, TP 20000.00

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

 ****

The [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) chart suggests that the down wave [Y] finished two years ago.
Next, the price started rising in a new bullish trend. The current price
structure looks like an upward double zigzag (W)-(X)-(Y). The first two
sub-waves (W) and (X) have completed as zigzags, there is forming the
final zigzag (Y). Let us see its structure of the (Y) wave in a shorter
timeframe.

Wave (Y) is composed of the sub-waves A-B-C. The impulse wave A and the
bearish zigzag-shaped corrective wave B have completed. Wave C is
unfolding as a simple impulse composed of five sub-waves
[1]-[2]-[3]-[4]-[5]. There is forming the final sub-wave, wave [5]. The
sub-waves 3-4-5 should conclude the uptrend at a level of around 665.00.

### Trading plan **[ETHUSD][2] **for the week:

Buy 582.50, TP 665.00

##  **Elliott wave Litecoin analysis**

 ****

There is forming a global uptrend as a zigzag A-B-C. The impulse wave A
finished, and the market has started declining in the triple zigzag
[W]-[X]-[Y]-[X]-[Z]. The second linking wave [X] is a double zigzag
(W)-(X)-(Y), with the final leg (Y) forming inside. Let us study its
structure in more detail in the eight-hour timeframe.

Wave (Y) is also a bullish double zigzag, like the major trend. There is
forming the beginning of the upward wave Y, which could be a simple
zigzag [a]-[b]-[c]. The impulse wave [a] should complete at a level of
around 115.0. Next, following a short drawdown in correction [b], the
price should continue rising in impulse [c] towards a level of 145.00.

### Trading plan for **[LTCUSD][3]**  for the week:

Buy 87.48, TP 115.00

* * *

##  **Elliott wave EOS analysis**

 ****

There is forming the global corrective wave B as a descending triple
zigzag. The first four parts of this pattern have completed, and there
is developing the final motive wave [Z]. Presumably, wave [Z] should
conclude as a simple down zigzag (A)-(B)-(C), where impulse (A) is
complete, and the corrective wave (B) is unfolding. Let us see the
structure of this correction in more detail.

The corrective wave (B) is unfolding as a double zigzag W-X-Y. Wave W is
a simple zigzag, the linking wave X is also a zigzag. There is forming
the final leg of the Y zigzag, namely the bullish impulse wave [c]. The
price should continue rising to a level of 3.52, where wave (B) will
reach 76.4% Fibonacci level of the (A) impulse. Next, the market should
turn down and start declining in a new downtrend.

### Trading plan for **[EOSUSD][4]**  for the week

Buy 3.12, TP 3.52

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

 ****

The XRPUSD market is forming a large descending triple zigzag. The first
three legs of this zigzag must have completed, and there is now forming
the bullish linking wave [X]. The [X] wave should be a double zigzag
(W)-(X)-(Y), where the sub-waves (W) and (X) have finished, and the (Y)
wave is still unfolding. Let us study the most recent chart section in
more detail on the eight-hour timeframe.

The (Y) wave is developing as a simple zigzag A-B-C. Wave A is a leading
diagonal, wave B is a bearish correction, wave C is an impulse currently
forming. The impulse wave [3] seems to have completed. After a short
decline in correction [4], the Ripple price should continue rising in
the final wave [5] towards a level of 0.540, as it is outlined in the
chart.

### Trading plan for **[XRPUSD][5]** for the week:

Buy 0.455, TP 0.540
