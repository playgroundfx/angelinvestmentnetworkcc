Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 23.11.2020Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I suggest entry signals
to trade each cryptocurrency.

The three cryptocurrency pairs are forming bullish double zigzags, with
final legs forming inside. Let us explore the structure of each
cryptocurrency chart in detail.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

 ****

The current BTCUSD structure displays the linking upward wave [X]
developing as a double combination composed of three sub-waves
(W)-(X)-(Y). The two-hour timeframe displays the final leg in the last
wave (Y), which is a simple zigzag A-B-C. After the triangle correction
B finished, there has started forming the bullish impulse C, composed of
the sub-waves [1]-[2]-[3]-[4]-[5]. The price should be declining in the
zigzag-shaped corrective wave [4] towards the level of 17590.00, as it
is outlined in the chart. Next, the market could resume rising in wave
[5] towards a level of 20000.00.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 18262.12, TP 20000.00

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

 ****

The two-hour timeframe of the XRPUSD price chart displays the upward
linking wave [X], which is unfolding as a double zigzag (W)-(X)-(Y).
There is currently forming the final bullish wave (Y) composed of the
sub-waves A-B-C. Wave A is a leading diagonal, correction B is a triple
zigzag, wave C is an impulse currently unfolding. The price should
shortly decline a little in correction [4]. When wave [4] finishes, the
market will resume growing in the final wave [5] towards a level of
0.540.

### Trading plan for **[XRPUSD][2]** today:

Buy 0.446, TP 0.540

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

 ****

The ETHUSD market is also forming the upward double zigzag, with the
final sub-wave (Y) developing inside. The (Y) wave is unfolding as a
zigzag A-B-C. There is forming wave C as a bullish five-wave impulse.
The first four legs of this impulse have completed, and there is forming
the final impulse wave (5) within the wave [5]. An approximate
trajectory of the Ethereum future price movement is outlined in the
chart. The uptrend should conclude at a level of about 618.00. At this
level, the C impulse will be 76.4% of wave A.

### Trading plan for  **[ETHUSD][3] **today:

Buy 559.09, TP 618.00
