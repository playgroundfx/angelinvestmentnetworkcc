Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 16.03.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

Bitcoin and Ethereum should have completed the corrective waves, so the
prices should be rising in impulse waves.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

The BTCUSD market is now rising in the upward impulse wave. There have
finished the two first small sub-waves [1] and [2]. Next, the market has
started forming a more powerful impulse wave [3]. The bearish corrective
wave (4) can have completed as a zigzag. It signals the market should
start rising in impulse wave (5). The nearest target for purchases is at
level 58116.00, marked by a small impulse wave 3.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 54102.50, TP 58116.00

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

The XRPUSD market is forming the corrective wave (D) as a simple
downward zigzag [A]-[B]-[C]. The bearish impulse wave [A] has completed,
and the market has started moving sideways in correction [B], which is
unfolding as a contracting triangle. The first four legs of the triangle
have completed, so the price should be rising in the final sub-wave (E)
up to the resistance level and level 0.482.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] today:

Buy 0.436, TP 0.482

## Elliott wave Ethereum analysis

The ETHUSD market is forming the upward impulse wave C, with the final
fifth wave unfolding inside. There is forming the final leg of the fifth
sub-wave, impulse (5). Impulse (5) is composed of the sub-waves
1-2-3-4-5. The down corrective wave 4 has completed as a zigzag
[a]-[b]-[c]. Therefore, the market should be rising in sub-wave 5. The
first target to enter trades is level 1940.00, marked by the impulse
wave 3.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Buy 1735.53, TP 1940.00
