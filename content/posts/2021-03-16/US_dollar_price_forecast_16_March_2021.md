Dollar is calm before the storm. Forecast as of 16.03.2021Dmitri
Demidenko

The [EURUSD][1] is trading in a narrow trading range ahead of one of the
most important Fed meetings. It is natural, and [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s do not want to
risk. Traders are waiting for Jerome Powell’s speech to get clues on the
Fed’s future [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). Let us discuss the Forex outlook and make up a
trading plan.

## Weekly US dollar fundamental forecast

Markets worry because of the Fed’s patience. The Treasury yield is
rallying up, reminding the taper tantrum of 2013. Derivatives signal the
interest rates should be up in the first quarter. However, 75% of
Bloomberg experts believe that the FOMC will not change its forecasts
for the federal funds rate, suggesting that it will rise no earlier than
the beginning of 2024. There will be a battle between [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s and Fed,
and the current [EURUSD][1] consolidation gives rise to associations
with the calm before the storm.

It seems that the FOMC March meeting is the one the Fed would like to
avoid. Much has changed since December when the Fed released its latest
forecasts. Congress added about $ 3 trillion in fiscal stimulus, which,
along with rapid vaccinations in the US, increases the expected economic
growth. According to Bloomberg experts, the Fed will revise up its
forecast for the US GDP for 2021 from 4.2% to 5.8%, although it will
remain very conservative. The OECD expects to see the US GDP at 6.5%,
while Goldman Sash even suggests 7.7%.

The increased growth expectations suggest a soon monetary normalization.
However, according to Powell, the Fed doesn’t want to repeat the error
made in 2013, when an early end of the QE resulted in the taper tantrum.
Nevertheless, the current structure of the debt and derivatives markets
suggests that [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s, even without the Fed, know what to do. Options
signal 10-year Treasury yields will rise to 1.85% by the end of 2021,
and CME futures signal a 75% probability of a federal funds rate hike in
December 2022. In the latest FOMC forecast, only one member of the Open
Market Committee believed that this would happen next year, five
expected monetary tightening in 2023; the rest said the federal funds
rate wouldn’t be up until 2024.

Meanwhile, Jerome Powell and his fellow central-bankers repeat the
mantra that the Treasury yield rally should not raise concerns as it
signals the expectations of the US economy’s explosive growth. But what
if the 10-year yield exceeds 2%? Based on the PMI data, the US yield
could grow above 3%.

Of course, the Fed will stop being patient sooner or later. Due to the
pandemic and recession, government loans in the world have increased by
60% over the past 12 months, which is twice as much as during the
previous crisis. The US national debt has exceeded 100% of GDP, and the
growth in the servicing cost will slow down the economy. And then
there's Joe Biden, who is planning the first massive tax hike since
1993.

### Weekly [EURUSD][1] trading plan

The Treasury yield growth and tightening of the fiscal [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) are
powerful drivers for the [S&P 500][2] correction. Jerome Powell should
be cautious not to trigger a sell-off wave in mid-March. Meanwhile,
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are waiting for the Fed meeting to revise investment ideas,
and the [EURUSD][1] is consolidating in the range of 1.188-1.199. I do
not recommend entering any trades.
