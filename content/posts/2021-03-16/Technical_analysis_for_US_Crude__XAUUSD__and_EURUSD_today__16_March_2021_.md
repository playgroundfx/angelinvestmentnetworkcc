Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 16.03.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

On Monday, oil prices fell and reached the short-term uptrend key
support 64.16 - 63.93, which led to a short-term increase in the rate
and a test of resistance 65.50.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

On Monday, oil prices fell and reached the short-term uptrend key
support 64.16 - 63.93, which led to a short-term increase in the rate
and a test of resistance 65.50. The price didn't break out the
resistance.

The price is declining again, and a false breakout pattern to sell,
which appeared yesterday, has worked out. It is profitable to hold sell
trades on correction according to this pattern to update the Monday low.
To sell oil according to the trend, the closing of the US trading
session below the Intermediary Zone 64.12 - 63.93 is required.

For purchases, the breakout of level 65.44 and price consolidation
higher at several trading sessions are required.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

Hold sales entered on the correction according to the false breakout
pattern. TakeProfit: 64.41, 64.16. StopLoss: 65.62.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

Gold bulls are once again trying to break out the short-term downtrend
key resistance 1738 - 1726. If the price closes above the level at the
US session today, the trend will reverse up. In this case, consider
purchases with the target in the upper Target Zone 1786 - 1776.

A breakout of the Additional Zone 1712 - 1709 is required for gold sales
within the current trend. At the moment, the price is far from the
level. There is no reason to open gold short trades.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

Watch the market.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

Yesterday, the euro traders were unable to break out the resistance
1.1960. This led to the sale of the asset and the test of support level
1.1917. The support was held and is still being held.

The EUR/USD short-term trend is up. The growth target is the Target Zone
1.2011 - 1.1995. It is profitable to look for euro purchases at the
current levels.

A breakout of support at 1.1905 is required for the euro sales. In this
case, the short-term trend will reverse down, and the target for sales
will be the lower Target Zone 1.1830 - 1.1814.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

Buy in the zone of 1.1917 - 1.1905. TakeProfit: 1.1960, 1.1989.
StopLoss: 1.1886.
