Loonie being tough. Forecast as of 16.03.2021Dmitri Demidenko

If the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc are among Forex outsiders in
2021, then the Canadian dollar can be safely called one of the market
favorites. The end of the [USDCAD][1] sellers' attacks may result in
[EURCAD][2] price fall and vice versa. Let us discuss the Forex outlook
and make up a trading plan

## Weekly Canadian dollar fundamental forecast

Looking at the greenback's pace on Forex, one can't help but wonder
which currency will be able to resist the USD? Judging by the strong oil
positions, the optimistic outlook for the economy, and rumors about the
normalization of the BoC's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), the Canadian dollar will
become the leader of the opposition. So far, the loonie is in the lead
among more than three dozen currencies tracked by Bloomberg. The
Canadian dollar has strengthened against the US dollar by 2% since the
beginning of the year. [USDCAD][1] bears are not going to give up their
positions just like that.

In the lead-up to the March meeting, the BoC's officials knew what
consequences its hawkish stance could cause for the loonie, inflation,
and exports, so they tried to sound more dovish. The BoC refused to cut
the volume of weekly asset purchases under the QE program from the
current CA$4 billion, announced its intention to keep the overnight rate
at 0.25% until 2023, and noted that accommodative monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) is
rational due to the weak labor market. It makes sense to normalize
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) if the labor market starts to recover. Less than two
days later, the February statistics on PMI showed an employment growth
of 259.2 thousand and an unemployment drop from 9.4% to 8.2%, which is
the lowest level since the beginning of the pandemic. How could the
loonie not grow up?

### Overnight rate dynamics

Concerning such statistics, indicating the economy's resilience to
lockdowns and its readiness to boost in the next few months, the Bank of
Canada is likely to be under severe pressure. The chances of the QE
program reduction and overnight rate increase before 2023 will grow,
which will support [USDCAD][1] and [EURCAD][2] bears.

The loonie failed to maintain its 3-year high against the greenback due
to a pullback in oil prices. Since October, black gold has added about
80% to its value, so the consolidation seems inevitable. Due to the
reluctance of global demand to grow, the market is experiencing the most
serious contango since January, which indicates an oversupply.

### Oil market conditions

I don't think the rumors about the commodity market super-cycle are
exaggerated. [Brent][3] and [WTI][4] are trading in the uptrend amid the
rapid growth of the global economy. This fact, in addition to an
improvement in global risk appetite and a narrowing yield spread between
US and Canadian bonds, gives Scotiabank reason to predict a decline of
[USDCAD][1] prices to 1.2. Wells Fargo officials believe the loonie will
continue to outperform most of its G10 competitors in 2021, while TD
Securities recommends buying it against the euro.

### Weekly [USDCAD][1] and [EURCAD][2] trading plan

In my opinion, the Canadian dollar is one of the few world currencies
that are able to show resilience during the situation triggered by the
rise in US debt market rates. This year, the loonie is the Forex
favorite, and if it manages to hold its positions after the March Fed
meeting, most likely, it will continue to strengthen. In the meantime,
it makes sense to hold [USDCAD][1] and [EURCAD][2] [short trades][5]
formed from levels 1.2615 and 1.4985 and move stop-orders to breakeven
to insure against Jerome Powell's unpleasant surprises.
