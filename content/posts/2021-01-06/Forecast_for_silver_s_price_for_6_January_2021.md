Blue wave calls silver. Forecast as of 06.01.2021Dmitri Demidenko

The Democrats' victory in Georgia will help silver to head north as the
reflation environment will strengthen, and the USD will weaken. But what
if a Republican sneaks into the Senate? Let's discuss it and make a
trading plan for [XAGUSD][1]

## Monthly fundamental forecast for silver

Twenty-twenty was a bright year for silver. The [XAGUSD's][1] quotes
grew 47% amid pandemic-driven production cuts, strong investment demand,
the global industry's fast recovery, accelerating inflation
expectations, and a weak USD. Silver was the best performer in the
sector of precious metals. However, it has not exhausted its growth
potential yet as old drivers are still in the game.

Metal Focus estimates that silver production fell 6.3% y-o-y to 780
million ounces in 2020. The countries that suffered the most are Peru,
China, Mexico, and Argentina. On the contrary, investment demand grew.
In the first place, in the USA and Europe.

Silver grows popular amid growing inflation expectations and the world
economy's increasing debts. Ten-year inflation-protected US bonds
dropped to their historic low of minus 1.109% since the blue wave
started looking more likely. The spread between 10-year Treasury and
TIPS yields, known as a breakeven rate, rose to 2.021%. A breakeven rate
reflects [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s' expectations concerning average inflation in the
next ten years. The level of 2.021% is a peak value last seen in 2018.

The world's leading countries lavished their economies with fiscal
stimuli in 2020, but they will have to pay the bill in 2021, with the
debt of $13 trillion (+51% y-o-y) coming due. The biggest payers will be
the US ($7.7 trillion), Japan ($2.9 trillion), China ($577 billion),
Italy ($433 billion), France ($348 billion), and Germany ($325 billion).

The global economy appears to be doomed to a high debt-to-GDP ratio and
new borrowings, which will pay off the old ones. The debt-to-GDP ratio
reached the highest value since WWII. Still, the governments are not
concerned about that: [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) says money can be easily borrowed if bond
rates do not exceed economic growth rates. According to the World Bank,
the global GDP will grow by 4% in 2021. However, as the theory suggests,
there's a moment when money printing and associated inflation become the
only alternative to defaults. This circumstance heats interest in
precious metals. Another crucial factor is that the Fed does not plan to
raise the federal funds rate.

Chicago Fed Chair Charles L. Evans said the Fed was ready to tolerate
inflation higher than 2.5% and would even not fear PCE at 3%. This
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) contributes to the USD's weakening and lowers real treasury
yield. So, the [XAGUSD][1] bulls feel blessed.

### Monthly trading plan for silver

There can be problems if the Democrats lose the Georgia elections:
additional fiscal stimuli and reflation environment will look less
likely, and silver will be sold on growth to $28.3-28.5 and $29.2-29.5
per ounce. On the contrary, the Blue Wave will help silver update
August's high and return to the value of $30 last seen in February 2013.
