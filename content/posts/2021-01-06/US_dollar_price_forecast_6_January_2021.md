Run, Dollar, run! Forecast as of 06.01.2021Dmitri Demidenko

While Georgia counts election votes, the EURUSD traders forgot about the
pandemic. Regardless of who wins, the [S&P 500][1] should continue the
rally, and global risk appetite will rise. How will the dollar react?
Let us discuss the Forex outlook and make up a [EURUSD][2] trading plan.

## Quarterly US dollar fundamental forecast

Do not make hasty decisions! The [EURUSD][2] pair is trading around
level 1.23 but doesn’t rise higher, expecting Georgia's voting results.
The Republicans’ victory will restore the status quo supporting the
growth of large US tech companies, which are now concerned about
tightening tax laws under Joe Biden. The triumph of Democrats will
increase the likelihood of additional fiscal stimulus, a reflationary
environment, supporting the stock indexes. The [S&P 500][1] should
continue rally anyway. If so, the US dollar bulls will step back.

Donald Trump is making weak attempts to stay in power, which results in
a division of opinion among Republicans. Some members of the Republican
party believe that Trump will be responsible in case the Elephants lose.
Traders realize that Trump’s attempts to overturn the election are
groundless so, the greenback will hardly start a correction up.
Investors still remember the slogan ‘what is good for Trump is good for
the dollar,’ and Trump is in trouble now.

Regardless of Georgia's election results, the US fiscal [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) will
remain stimulating, and the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) – ultra-easy. Federal
Reserve Bank of Chicago President Charles Evans says monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
needs to focus on the economy and that Fed officials should turn to
regulatory tools if they see any problems in the stock market related
to, for example, the risks of financial instability or bubbles. The
Federal Reserve is not going to change its stance, and the ‘blue wave’
could push the [S&P 500][1] even higher. The [EURUSD][2] bears can do
nothing but run.

US politics has distracted [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s' attention from the coronavirus for
a while. According to the World Bank’s forecasts, if vaccination yields
positive results, global GDP will expand by 4% in 2021. If vaccines are
not effective, the global economy will grow by 1.6%. The first gauge was
lowered by 0.2% compared to the data reported in June, which results
from the second COVID-19 wave and associated lockdowns.

### World Bank’s forecasts



 _Source_ _: Financial Times_

The World Bank lowered its forecasts for euro-area GDP in 2021 from 4.5%
to 3.6%, the expected US GDP growth is down from 4% to 3.5%. The growth
gap is narrowing, which is a bearish factor for the [EURUSD][2] in the
middle term. The euro rally might end in the first quarter already. The
matter is how far the pair will rise before it starts consolidation or a
correction.

The uptrend is strong in the meanwhile. The Fed will hardly hike the
interest rate before 2024. Neither the status quo in Congress nor a
‘blue wave’ will stop the US stock indexes' rally. Besides, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s
are not concerned about an increase in COVID-19 cases or the record
number of hospitalizations in the USA. Yes, humankind could face the
third and the fourth pandemic waves, but vaccination will eventually
help to win the battle with the coronavirus.

### Quarterly [EURUSD][2] trading plan

I reckon the [S&P 500][1] could hit its all-time highs, and the
[EURUSD][2] should be up to 1.25-1.27 in the first quarter. It is still
relevant to buy the euro versus the US dollar.
