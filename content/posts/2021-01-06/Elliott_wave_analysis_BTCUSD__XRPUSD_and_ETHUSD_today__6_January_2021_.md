Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 06.01.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I suggest entry signals
to trade each cryptocurrency.

Ripple and Ethereum are forming down impulses. Bitcoin price is rising
in the bullish impulse.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

 ****

There is forming the upward impulse wave (5). The first four legs of
wave (5) have completed. The sub-waves 1 and 3 are impulses, corrective
sub-waves 2 and 4 are zigzags. There is forming wave 5 that is a bullish
five-wave impulse. Wave [3] of 5 could end at a level of around
38600.00. Next, the market should be declining in correction [4], as it
is outlined in the chart.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 35341.75 TP 38600.00

* * *

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

 ****

The XRPUSD market is forming the down wave (W) composed of three main
sub-waves A-B-C. The price is now declining in the impulse wave C that
is composed of the sub-waves [1]-[2]-[3]-[4]-[5]. There is forming the
final fifth wave, with the corrective wave (4) recently completed
inside. Correction (4) is a triple zigzag w-x-y-xx-z. Over the next few
days, the price should be declining in wave (5) to a level of 0.100. One
could enter sell trades in the current situation.

### Trading plan for **[XRPUSD][2]** today:

Sell 0.225, TP 0.100

* * *

## Elliott wave Ethereum analysis

 ****

The ETHUSD market continues forming the final impulse wave 5 that is
composed of five sub-waves. The market has recently completed the
bullish impulse [iii], which is an element of the upward impulse wave
[v]. There is currently forming the bearish correction (iv) as a zigzag
a-b-c. The zigzag-shaped wave b must have completed, and it suggests the
market should start declining in the impulse sub-wave c. The price
should hit level 878.49, marked by wave a.

### Trading plan for  **[ETHUSD][3] **today:

Sell 1121.06, TP 878.49
