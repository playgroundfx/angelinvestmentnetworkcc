Economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the week 15.11.2021 – 21.11.2021Jana Kane

##  **Review of the main events of the Forex economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the
next trading week (15.11.2021 – 21.11.2021)**

Despite the decline on the last day of the last week, the dollar
nevertheless ended it in positive territory with a significant increase.
Last week, the DXY dollar index added about 0.8%, rising above 95.00,
which corresponds to the levels of mid-July 2020.

The main reason for the strengthening of the dollar is the increased
likelihood of an earlier-than-planned increase in the Fed's interest
rate. As follows from data published last Wednesday by the US Department
of Labor Statistics, the US consumer price index (CPI) in October jumped
by 6.2% (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)), which was the strongest growth in the last
more than 30 years (the forecast assumed an increase CPI +5.8% after a
rise of +5.4% in September).

At the same time, the optimistic weekly data with statistics on the
number of jobless claims also indicate a continuing recovery in the US
labor market (the number of initial claims for unemployment benefits
fell to 267 thousand from 271 thousand a week earlier, which is in line
with pre-crisis levels).

Now we see that inflation is significantly higher than the Fed's target
of 2%, and perhaps this is not temporary, as the Fed believes, and the
state of the labor market is approaching the levels observed before the
pandemic.

Now market participants will carefully study the macro statistics coming
from the United States and follow the speeches of the Fed
representatives in order to better assess the prospects for the monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the American central bank, and next week market participants
will also pay attention to the publication of important macro statistics
from China, the UK, Eurozone, the US, and Canada.

 ***during the coming week, new events may be added to the [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) and
/ or some scheduled events may be canceled**

###  **02:00 CNY Retail Sales Index**

Retail Sales Index is published monthly by the National Bureau of
Statistics of China and measures total retail sales and cash receipts.
The index is often considered an indicator of consumer confidence and
economic wellbeing and reflects the health of the retail sector in the
near term. A rise in the index is usually positive for the CNY; a
decrease in the indicator will have a negative impact on the CNY. The
previous value of the index (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) was +4.4% (after an
increase of +8% in the last months of 2019 and a fall of -20.5% in
February 2020). Forecast: In October 2021, retail sales in China rose by
+3.5% (yoy), indicating an ongoing recovery, albeit at a slower pace
than in previous months of 2021, after a sharp drop in February-March
2020 of the year. If the data turns out to be even better, the CNY will
strengthen even more.

###  **Tuesday, November 16**

###  **00:30 AUD Minutes of the November meeting of the RB of
Australia**

This document is published two weeks after the meeting and the decision
on the interest rate. If the RBA positively assesses the state of the
labor market in the country, the rate of GDP growth, and also shows a
hawkish attitude towards the inflation forecast in the economy, the
markets regard this as a higher probability of a rate hike at the next
meeting, which is a positive factor for the AUD. The bank's soft
rhetoric regarding, above all, inflation puts pressure on the AUD.

During the last (November) meeting, the RBA kept the key interest rate
and the target level of yield on three-year government bonds unchanged
at around 0.10%.

In September, the RBA leaders decided to start reducing weekly purchases
of government bonds. The buyback program will now amount to A$ 4 billion
per week (up from A$ 5 billion previously) until at least mid-February
2022. RBA Governor Philip Lowe promised that "the RBA will review the
volume of bond purchases in mid-February," noting a sharp deterioration
in economic conditions.

Lowe reaffirmed the central bank's intentions not to raise interest
rates before 2024.

Many economists have already called this decision by the RBA to cut the
volume of stimulus a mistake.

Wages continue to rise slowly and household debt has risen to an all-
time high, which also puts interest rate hikes in the longer term.

According to Philip Lowe, "there is no serious argument in favor of
tightening monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) in the short term." In his opinion, "some
time will pass before interest rates are raised."

Nevertheless, if the published minutes contain unexpected information
regarding the issues of the RBA's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), the volatility in the
AUD quotes will increase.

###  **02:30 AUD Speech by the head of the RBA Philip Lowe**

In his speech, Philip Lowe will assess the current situation in the
Australian economy and point out further plans for the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
of the department.

Market participants would also like to hear Lowe's views on central bank
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and Australia's first
recession in 30 years. According to Lowe, "there is no serious argument
in favor of tightening monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) in the short term," and "it will
be some time before interest rates rise."

Any signals from him regarding a change in the plans of the RBA's
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) will cause a sharp increase in volatility in the AUD
trading and on the Australian stock market. If he does not touch on the
topic of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), the market reaction to his speech will be
weak.

###  **07:00 GBP Report on the average wages of British citizens for the
last 3 months. Unemployment rate**

On a monthly basis, the UK Office for National Statistics (ONS)
publishes a report on average wages covering the last 3 months, with and
without bonuses.

This report is a key short-term indicator of the dynamics of changes in
the level of wages of employees in the UK. Earnings growth is positive
for the GBP, while a low reading is negative. Forecast: November report
suggests that average wages with bonuses increased over the last
calculated 3 months (July-September) +7.0% (against +7.2%, +8.3%, +8.8%,
+7.3%, +5.6%, +4.0%, +4.5%, +4.8%, +4.7%, +3.7%, +2.8%, +1.3%, +0.1% in
previous periods); without bonuses - increased by +6.0% (against +6.0%,
+6.8%, +7.4%, +6.6%, +5.6%, +4.6%, +4.4%, +4.2%, +4.1%, +3.6%, +2.8%,
+1.9%, +0.9%, +0.2% in previous periods). Thus, the data indicate a
slowdown in the dynamics of wage growth, which is a negative factor for
the pound. If the data turns out to be better than forecast, the pound
is likely to strengthen in the foreign exchange market. The data worse
than the forecast will also have a negative impact on the pound.

Also at this time, data on unemployment in the UK are published. It is
expected that in the 3 months from July to September, unemployment was
at the level of 4.5% (against 4.5%, 4.6%, 4.7%, 4.8%, 4.7%, 4.8%, 4.9%,
5.0%, 5.1%, 5.0%, 4.9%, 4.8%, 4.5%, 4.3%, 3.9%, 3.9% previous periods).
Since 2012, the UK unemployment rate has declined steadily (from 8.0% in
September 2012). This is a positive factor for the pound, a rise in
unemployment is a negative factor.

If the data from the UK labor market turn out to be worse than the
forecast and / or the previous value, the pound will be under pressure.

In any case, at the time of the publication of data from the British
labor market, an increase in volatility in the pound quotes and on the
London Stock Exchange is expected.

###  **10:00 EUR ВВП Eurozones for the 3rd quarter (second estimate)**

GDP is considered to be an indicator of the overall health of the
economy. The upward trend in GDP is considered positive for the EUR; a
poor result weakens the EUR.

Recently, macro data from the Eurozone have been indicating a gradual
recovery in the growth rate of the European economy after a sharp drop
in early 2020.

So, according to the forecast of economists, based on the first
estimate, GDP growth in the Eurozone is expected in the 3rd quarter of
2021 by +2.2% (+3.7% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) after an increase of +2.2% (+14.3
% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) in the 2nd quarter and a decline of -0.3% (by -1.3%
in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) in the 1st quarter of 2021, by -0.7% (-4.9% in
annualized) in the 4th quarter of 2020, an increase of +12.5% ​​(a fall
of -4.3% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) in the 3rd quarter, a fall of -11.8% (-14.7%
in YoY) in the 2nd quarter and a decline of -3.6% (-3.1% YoY) in the 1st
quarter of 2020.

If the data turn out to be weaker than the forecast, the euro may
decline. Better-than-forecast data may strengthen the euro in the short
term, although it is still far from the full recovery of the European
economy even to pre-crisis levels (quarterly growth within 0.2% - 0.4%).

###  **13:30 USD Retail sales. Retail control group**

This report (Retail Sales) reflects the total sales of retailers of all
sizes and types. Changes in retail sales are the main indicator of
consumer spending. The report is a leading indicator, and in the future
the data may be strongly revised. A high result strengthens the US
dollar, a low one weakens it. A relative decrease in the indicator may
have a short-term negative impact on the dollar, while an increase in
the indicator will have a positive effect on the USD. In the previous
month (September), the value of the indicator was +0.7% (after an
increase of +0.9% in August, +0.7% in June, +10.7% in March, +7.6% in
January and fall by -2.9% in February), which indicates that the
improvement in this sector of the American economy is still unstable
after the partial lifting of strict quarantine restrictive measures in a
number of states. Forecast for October: +0.7%.

Retail sales is the leading indicator of consumer spending in the United
States, showing changes in retail sales. The Retail Control Group metric
measures volume across the entire retail industry and is used to
calculate price indices for most products. A strong result strengthens
the US dollar, and vice versa, a weak report weakens the dollar. A
slight increase in indicators is unlikely to accelerate the growth of
the dollar. The data worse than the values ​​of the previous period
(+0.8% in September, +2.6% in August, +1.4% in June, -1.4% in May) may
negatively affect the dollar in the short term. Forecast for October:
+0.4%.

###  **Wednesday, November 17**

###  **07:00 GBP Consumer price index. Core consumer price index**

Consumer Price Index (CPI) reflects the dynamics of retail prices for a
group of goods and services that make up the British consumer basket.
The CPI is a key indicator of inflation. Its publication causes active
movement of the pound in the foreign exchange market, as well as the
London Stock Exchange FTSE100 index.

In the previous reporting month (in September), the growth in consumer
inflation amounted to +0.3% (+3.1% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)). The data suggests
growing inflationary pressures, which are likely to support the pound.
The indicator reading below the forecast / previous value may provoke a
weakening of the pound, as low inflation will force the Bank of England
to adhere to a soft monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).

Core CPI is published by the Office for National Statistics and
determines the price change of a selected basket of goods and services
(excluding food and energy) for a given period. It is a key indicator
for assessing inflation and changes in purchasing preferences. A
positive result strengthens the GBP, a negative one weakens it.

In September, Core CPI (on an annualized basis) increased by +2.9%.
Probably, the publication of the indicator will have a positive effect
on the pound in the short term, if its value is higher than the forecast
and previous values. Forecast for October: +3.0% (annualized). The
indicator reading below the forecast and / or previous values ​​may
provoke a weakening of the pound.

###  **13:30 CAD Consumer price indices in Canada**

Core Consumer Price Index (Core CPI) from the Bank of Canada reflects
the dynamics of the retail prices of the corresponding basket of goods
and services (excluding fruits, vegetables, gasoline, fuel oil, natural
gas, mortgage interest, intercity transportation and tobacco products).
The inflation target for the Bank of Canada is in the range of 1-3%. The
rise in CPI is a harbinger of a rate hike and a positive factor for the
CAD. Consumer Price Index increased in September 2021 by +0.2% (+4.4% in
annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)). If the expected data turns out to be worse than the
previous values, it will negatively affect the CAD. The data will
strengthen the Canadian dollar better than the previous values.

###  **Thursday, November 18**

No important macro statistics scheduled to be released.

###  **Friday, November 19**

###  **08:00 EUR Speech by head of the ECB Christine Lagarde**

During the speech of the head of the ECB, the volatility of trade
increases not only in the euro and European stock indices, but
throughout the financial market, especially if Christine Lagarde touches
on the topic of the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the Central Bank. Any hints at
curtailing the QE program in the Eurozone will cause the euro to rise.
Lagarde's soft tone and the propensity to continue the extra soft
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the ECB will negatively affect the euro.

Speeches of the head of the ECB after the bank's meetings have a
particularly strong influence on the market. In previous periods, the
speech of the head of the ECB in similar situations could cause a change
in the euro exchange rate by more than 3%. If Christine Lagarde does not
touch upon the topic of the ECB's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), the reaction to her
speech will be weak.

###  **13:30** **CAD Retail Sales Index**

Retail Sales Index is published monthly by Statistics Canada and
estimates total retail sales. The index is often considered an indicator
of consumer confidence and reflects the health of the retail sector in
the near term. A rise in the index is usually positive for the CAD; a
decrease in the indicator will negatively affect the CAD. The previous
value of the index (for August) +2.1% after falling in March 2020 by
-10%, in April - by -24.8% and growth in May 2020 by +21.2%. If the data
for September turns out to be weaker than the forecast and / or the
previous value, the CAD may sharply decline in the short term.
