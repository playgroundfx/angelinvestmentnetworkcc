Dollar will not be patient. Forecast as of 15.11.2021Dmitri Demidenko

Fed’s passive attitude creates problems not only for the US president,
whose rating is falling against the background of accelerating inflation
but also for the central bank itself. The lack of labour supply drives
up prices even higher. How does this affect [EURUSD][1]? Let us discuss
the Forex outlook and make up a trading plan.

## Weekly US dollar fundamental forecast

The Fed’s mantra about the temporary nature of high inflation has
already been out of date. At the same time, the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of patience of
the central bank begins to become harmful. It not only increases the
bubbles in the asset markets but also presses down real incomes of the
population and downgrades the ratings of the current US president.
Furthermore, the reluctance of the Americans to return to the workforce
is exacerbating the Fed’s troubles.

Joe Biden’s popularity amid consumer prices rising by 5% and higher over
the past six months has been falling. According to Washington Post-ABC
News, the US president’s approval ratings fell from 50% in June and 44%
in September to 41%. About half of Americans blame him for soaring
inflation to 6.2% in October. They suffer from declining real incomes,
and the consumer confidence index has been down to a 10-year low. The
key event of the week ending November 19, the retail sales report, will
show the difference between what [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers say and what they do, but
the discontent is growing.

The US president is stumbling over the question of whom he should
appoint as the Fed Chair. Is Jerome Powell to serve a second term? But
it was his [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of patience that contributed to the acceleration of
inflation. Should Biden appoint Lael Brainard as Fed’s chair? She seems
to be even more dovish than Powell.

Anyway, The Fed’s passive approach creates problems. Amid the rise in
inflation expectations, real Treasury yields are falling to historic
lows. US government bonds are getting unattractive, and [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are
looking for another asset to buy inflating bubbles in asset markets.
[S&P 500][2] has had the highest number of record highs since 1964,
[bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) has reached its all-time high, and gold is rising despite US
dollar strength.

### Dynamics of US inflation expectations

Because of the Fed’s wait-and-see approach and huge amounts of cheap
liquidity, fear of missing out has gripped the global markets. Growing
stocks discourage Americans from going back to work. They don’t work
because they can live on investment income. Workforce shortage results
in higher wages, contributing to the inflation rise.

In late September, 10.4 million vacancies were opened in the United
States, or 1.4 for each person looking for a job. This is the highest
indicator in the 21-year [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) of record keeping. Some 4.4 million
people quit their jobs in September as they can easily find new ones
with higher wages. Furthermore, the difficulties with hiring employees
are only increasing: many employers offer bonuses for employment and
waive the requirements for education and experience.

### Weekly [EURUSD][1] trading plan

If the Fed continues to wait and see, discontent will continue growing.
The US central bank should quickly taper the QE and start raising rates.
If it does, it will be a strong argument to buy the greenback.
Therefore, if the price breaks out the support at 1.1435 or rebounds
from the resistances at 1.1495 and 1.1525, one could consider selling
the [EURUSD][1].
