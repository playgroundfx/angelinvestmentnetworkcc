Gold crossed the line. Forecast as of 15.11.2021Dmitri Demidenko

Gold showed the best weekly dynamics in six months, although the US
dollar is near 16-month highs against the euro. Isn't it a paradox? Let
us discuss the Forex outlook and make up a [XAUUSD][1] trading plan.

## Fundamental gold forecast for a week

The rise of gold by $40 per ounce, after the release of data concerning
US consumer price rise by 6.2%, was the biggest surprise for me in over
20 years of observing financial markets. Neither the downgrade of the US
credit rating in 2011, nor the SNB's refusal to fix the franc against
the euro in 2015, nor the Brexit referendum and Donald Trump's victory
in 2016 made such an impression as the unexpected rise of [XAUUSD][1].
In those cases, the assets' reaction was adequate. This cannot be said
about the precious metal.

I am a long-time opponent of the idea that gold is a hedge against
inflationary risks. In the 1970s, the abandonment of the gold standard
was accompanied by a rapid rise in prices, which is why [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s had
such associations: if you want to protect yourself from inflation, buy
precious metal. Next, the fate of [XAUUSD][1] depended not on the CPI,
but on what the Fed thought about the CPI. The question is why,
throughout 2021, high consumer prices were bad [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) for gold? And why in
November, the rise of the indicator to 6.2% turned everything upside
down?

Why over the decades the "anti-dollar" gold was falling when the
greenback was rising, and now they suddenly began to grow together?
[EURUSD][2] price is near a 16-year low, and gold has its best week in
half a year. Isn't it a paradox?

Why aren't [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/) stocks increasing? If you want to protect yourself from
the loss of the purchasing power of paper money, would you prefer a
physical asset or papers like futures?

### Dynamics of gold and [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/)s

 _Source: Bloomberg._

In my opinion, the [XAUUSD][1] rise is obvious speculation based on
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s' doubts about the Fed's ability to control inflation. There is
talk in the market that high prices are not temporary, and that the
central bank cannot solve supply chain problems or force OPEC+ to
produce more oil. As a result, inflation is currently growing faster
than the nominal yield of Treasury bonds. This is driving real debt
rates down to historic lows. It is worth mentioning that the decline in
real profitability creates the best conditions for speculation.

What will happen in 2022? Most likely, inflation will decrease in the
second half of the year, which is due to two factors, namely the
underlying effects and the fight against the pandemic. According to
Janet Yellen, it was COVID-19 that was the main reason for the CPI rise.
As soon as it ends, prices will begin to slow down. These events do not
cancel plans for two to three federal funds rate hikes in 2022 and will
continue to support the US dollar. Moreover, under political pressure
from Biden, dissatisfied with the acceleration of inflation, the Fed may
act more aggressively than expected in the near future. Namely, taper QE
faster and start monetary restriction earlier than is currently
expected.

### Weekly gold trading plan

If the Fed really starts to act more hawkish, gold will be in trouble.
The [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) connection between the precious metal and the greenback
will be restored, and [XAUUSD][1] downtrend will return. In this regard,
the price drop below $1850 and $1835 per ounce will be a reason for the
shorts' formation.
