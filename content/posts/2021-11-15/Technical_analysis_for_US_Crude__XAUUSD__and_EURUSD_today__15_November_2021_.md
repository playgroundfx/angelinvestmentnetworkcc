Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 15.11.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

Last week, EURUSD was trading in a short-term downtrend.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

On Monday morning a short-term oil downtrend continues. Last Friday,
traders tested the Additional Zone 80.16 - 80.03. The zone was held and
this morning there was a price decline and a test of the support level
of 78.95.

The target of the trend is still the lower Target Zone 78.48 - 77.97. If
the TZ is broken out, then the next target will be the Gold Zone 75.93 -
75.67.

It is reasonable to enter new oil sales either in the Additional Zone
according to the pattern or in the Intermediary Zone 81.56 - 81.31.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

Hold down sales / sell according to the pattern in Additional Zone 80.16
- 80.03. TakeProfit: 78.95, Target Zone 78.48 - 77.97. StopLoss:
according to the pattern rules.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

At the close of trading last week, a trading recommendation to buy gold
in the Intermediary Zone 1849 - 1847 yielded profits. The local November
10 high has also been updated. The short-term trend remains up. Now the
price is correcting and testing the Additional Zone 1859 - 1858. If the
AZ is broken out downside, the target of the correction will be the
trend key support 1849 - 1848.

Today I recommend looking for purchases according to the pattern with a
target at Friday's high. The Target Zone 3 1875 - 1871 serves as the
main growth target. It is possible to enter long trades both in the AZ
and the IZ.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

Open buy positions according to the pattern in 1859 - 1848. TakeProfit:
1868. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

Last week, EURUSD was trading in a short-term downtrend. Within the
trend, the Target Zone 1.1516 - 1.1498 was broken out. The next target
for sales is the Gold Zone 1.1428 - 1.1419. Now the price is trading in
the correction and is approaching the Additional Zone 1.1481 - 1.1477.

It is profitable to look for new euro sales in the Additional and
Intermediary zones, which are strong resistance levels. The trend border
is in the zone of 1.1529 - 1.1514. Use the Friday low and the Gold Zone
as a sales target.

It will be possible to enter Euro purchases in case of breakout of level
1.1481. In this case, the IZ will serve as a target.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

  1. Sell according to the pattern in Additional Zone 1.1481 - 1.1477. TakeProfit: Gold Zone 1.1428 - 1.1419. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. Sell according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 1.1529 - 1.1521. TakeProfit: Gold Zone 1.1428 - 1.1419. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.
