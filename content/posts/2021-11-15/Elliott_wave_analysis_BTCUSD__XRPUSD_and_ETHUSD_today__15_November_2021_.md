Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 15.11.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

The XRPUSD could be forming the linking wave (X) as a contracting
triangle.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

The BTCUSD continues forming the global impulse wave (A) as an element
of a large corrective trend. The final sub-wave 5 of the (A) impulse is
currently developing. Wave 5 must be developing as an ending diagonal
[1]-[2]-[3]-[4]-[5]. The final wave [5] should conclude the diagonal at
a level of 69800.00. After this level is reached, the price should start
declining in the new corrective wave.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 65780.50, TP 69800.00

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

The XRPUSD market is forming the linking wave (X) as a horizontal
contracting triangle A-B-C-D-E. There is unfolding corrective wave D as
a simple zigzag [A]-[B]-[C]. The price should be rising in the motive
wave (Y), which is to conclude correction [B]. Next, the market should
start declining in the [C] impulse to a level of 1.050, as outlined in
the chart. An approximate trajectory of the Ripple future price movement
is outlined in the chart.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] **** today:

Sell 1.209, TP 1.050

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

The ETHUSD is forming the upward wave C as an element of a large zigzag.
The C wave is a bullish impulse composed of sub-waves
[1]-[2]-[3]-[4]-[5]. The chart displays the final leg of the impulse
wave [5]. There is forming sub-wave (5), namely its last sub-wave 5.
After the triangle correction finished, the price has started rising.
The market should be growing to a level of 4950.00; next, the price will
start declining. One could enter long trades in the current situation.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Buy 4707.03, TP 4950.00
