XRP Price Predictions & Ripple forecast: 2021 and BeyondJana Kane

Ripple XRP is one of the world's foremost cryptos - and one of the most
intriguing. Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other big names, it does not
market itself with its decentralization. Instead, the crypto is closely
associated with several banks, investment companies, and organizations
worldwide.

This may seem counterproductive when many traders believe that the
biggest trading point of cryptocurrencies is their freedom of influence
from outside companies. However, crypto experts are increasingly arguing
that it could be the key to Ripple's success.

At the end of 2020, the company faced an SEC lawsuit that put the Ripple
future under threat. At the beginning of 2021, Ripple was going through
difficult times; however, upon reaching some highs in April and then in
August, it gave hope to [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s and provided traders with the
opportunity to speculate on the ups and downs of the XRP price. Despite
the SEC lawsuit, which began in 2020, the company has remained afloat
and is planning to launch a marketplace for financial firms so that they
offer their clients an option to buy and sell cryptocurrencies.

Making a Ripple price prediction has become challenging for experts and
common [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s. Why is Ripple going up and down? How high will Ripple
go? Let's find out!

The article covers the following subjects:

## What Is Ripple Crypto and the History of XRP?

Ripple or XRP: are they synonyms or different [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)? If you are new to
the crypto market, you may have such questions in your mind. Thus, we
will start our price guide with basic [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/). It will allow you to
differentiate Ripple's products.

Put simply, Ripple is a company that provides a payment protocol that
can be compared to a payment system, money transfer network, and
currency exchange. The protocol works with digital currencies, fiat
money, and commodities. XRP is the protocol's internal coin.

If you want to have a deeper understanding of the Ripple topic, check
the following [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/).

  * XRP or Ripple is a cryptocurrency that’s powered by RippleNet. Financial institutions use the coin to provide fast transactions with low fees. 

  * RippleNet represents a payment platform. It's based on the distributed ledger database of XRP Ledger. Ripple operates the digital platform. RippleNet Cloud is used to deal with payments with one integration and a common Ripple Payment Object among RippleNet’s customers. It allows for “less friction and more standardization when customers are ready to scale.” 

  * As for the XRP Ledger, it's open-source and is based on the ledger database, not [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/). 

Ripple's all-time high price reached 3.84 USD on 7 January 2018
(CoinMarketCap).

### A Crash Course on Ripple XRP

Ryan Fugger was the first person who announced the idea of Ripple. It
was in 2004. However, the protocol's real [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) started only in 2012
when Jed McCaleb and Chris Larson took over the project. That time it
was not even Ripple but OpenCoin.

First, it was a startup project from San Francisco; the [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/)-like
payment system was developed. It was created as an alternative to money
transfers for the banking system, not as an opposition. Its popularity
among financial institutions grew fast, and soon the company announced
interest from leading banks. It was expected as the system enforced low-
fee fast transfers all around the world.

Banks apply the protocol to make cross-border transfers in real-time
using the xCurrent software solution. At the same time, Ripple (XRP) is
also available for [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s and traders. Traders can do operations with
the cryptocurrency via trading on crypto exchanges or with the help of
brokers. The company has had [contact](https://www.playgroundfx.com/contact/)s at the [highest political and
financial levels][1] for many years. Think of the World Bank, the ECB,
the IMF, and the World Economic Forum. With rave recommendations and
being priced from all sides – what could go wrong?

Here we are. It's time to find out what is expected of Ripple in 2021
and beyond.

## How Has The Price Of Ripple Changed Over Time?

It’s wrong to check XRP price predictions without looking back at recent
and not-so-recent events. The SEC situation made that even more precise.
The Ripple price today on 15.11.2021 is $1.17290. Looking at the full
price chart below, you can see how the price of XRP changed over the
years.

XRP was stable from its launch in 2013 until early 2017, when the
sideway movement ended. By the end of 2017, its price skyrocketed by
35,000%. This success occurred as Ripple managed to achieve a threshold
of 100 banks worldwide that signed on to RippleNet.

On January 4th, 2018, the [XRP/USD][2] rate reached an all-time high.
However, it couldn’t sustain those levels, and it subsequently dropped
by 76% within one month. The plummet was caused by fears of new
[regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/)s on the Asian markets. This factor affected not only XRP but
also other cryptos. In 2018, the total market cap for cryptocurrencies
declined by around 43%.

The sharp downtrend that continued until February was also boosted by
other factors. Facebook declared it would ban advertisements for
cryptocurrencies and ICOs. US regulators summoned Bitfinex and Tether to
a court. The further decline was spurred by the finance minister of
India, who said the country would do everything it could to discontinue
the use of virtual currencies.

However, the year did not only bring bad [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) for XRP. A significant
surge took place in September 2018. Within several days at the end of
September, Ripple grew by over 140%. The XRP/USD rate was pushed up
after Ripple’s Head of Regulatory Relations for Asia-Pacific and the
Middle East, Sagar Sarbhai, said the company would release a product to
expedite bank transactions with the use of XRP.

2019 was quite stable for Ripple, with no dramatic ups and downs. As the
Ripple network is very active in Southeast Asia, [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) on cross-border
payments and state cryptocurrencies in this region significantly impacts
its price. For instance, the XRP’s rate moved up after Japan and South
Korea started working on time and cost reduction for transferring
international funds between the two countries. By the end of 2019, the
downtrend strengthened.

Unlike other crypto assets, which started an upward movement in late
2020, XRP’s price spiked by the middle of 2021 and later, after one more
plunge, reached a good price in August.

### What Happened to XRP in 2020 and 2021?

During 2020, the [XRP market price][3] was relatively stable with
several medium-term bullish and bearish trends. After the upward
movement at the beginning of the year, the price was declining for a
month, from February to March. The next bullish trend occurred in July
but finished in less than a month. The main rise happened in November
when the price hit a maximum of $0.79.

Why is Ripple going up or down? If you think that something specific is
hidden behind these price movements, it's a mistake. The major Ripple
trends are positively correlated with BTC movements, so even Bitcoin
halving can affect the XRP price. The cryptocurrency repeats the trend
of the primary market.

Still, there were some certain events we should mention. Investors'
sentiments determine the price direction of any asset. Ripple
supply/demand factor plays a huge role. In April 2020, the co-founder of
Ripple Jed McCaleb sold 54 million Ripples. It's not a surprise that the
price moved down after the event became public.

New agreements with leading banks are one of the main drivers of XRP's
price. For example, in August, India's largest bank HDFC Bank Limited
joined RippleNet, in November, the second American largest bank, the
Bank of America, signed an agreement with Ripple.

In December, such leading US exchanges as Coinbase and Binance claimed
support for the upcoming airdrop of Spark tokens by Flare Networks. The
Flare airdrop took place, and 45 billion Spark tokens were distributed
among the XRP holders. The XRP price increased on the [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/); however, it
was corrected shortly.

Such events have short-term market effects that aren’t visible on high
timeframes.

Well, we have come to the most significant event that is still affecting
Ripple. The SEC, the US stock market watchdog, is [challenging][4]
[blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) company Ripple Inc. in court, along with its two top figures,
CEO Brad Garlinghouse and founder Christian Larsen. The [regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/)s in
the US are tough. The Securities and Exchange Commission's accusation is
that unregistered securities worth [$1.3 billion were sold in 2013][4].
It is an old case hanging over Ripple for as long as we can remember.
Ripple has always maintained that the digital currency is a currency
instead of a security. Because otherwise, they'd have to comply with a
lot of different rules according to American law. Many are amazed that
the US apparently wants to slaughter the goose that lays the golden
eggs.

In two days, from December 22 to 23, 2020, the XRP rate dropped from
approximately $0.50 to just under $0.30. From third place as the most
important cryptocurrency, the coin moved to fourth place, behind
stablecoin Tether.

XRP started 2021 at lows. Only on January 30th did the cryptocurrency
break above $0.40. After the breakthrough, XRP was trading within a
narrow $0.40-0.60 range from the end of January to April 4th. The strong
uptrend started on April 5th and lasted until April 14th, when the price
reached $1.80 (the high of January 2018). The surge was caused by two
court rulings in favor of XRP.

Currently, Ripple is the seventh most popular cryptocurrency in the
world, as stated by [CoinMarketCap][5].

However, from April to June, the market saw a strong drop in the XRP
rate - more than two times: from $1.83 to $0.51. This happened amid the
ongoing litigation between the SEC and Ripple, but the reason was the
overall negative dynamics of the crypto market, which collapsed from
previously reached [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) highs. In June, the SEC requested to
extend the case consideration by two months, which the court granted.
From June to the beginning of September, against the backdrop of a lull
in the court, XRP’s rate increased from $0.51 to $1.39.

However, XRP couldn’t maintain its bullish trend and plunged on
September 7. The significant plummet was caused by the fall of BTC.
Experts couldn’t find the real reasons for Bitcoin’s decline on the same
day it became legal tender in El Salvador. Such events usually push the
price up, but not this time.

XRP wasn’t as successful in recovering as Bitcoin was. It took 2 weeks
to restore the uptrend. Although the XRP/USD pair hasn’t reached the
highs seen at the beginning of September, the uptrend is in force.

On November 9, Ripple announced the upcoming launch of a marketplace for
financial firms. It will allow financial service companies to offer
their clients an option to buy and sell cryptocurrencies. The start of
the platform, which will be called Liquidity Hub, is scheduled for 2022.
Firms’ customers will be able to use it to buy crypto assets from
various sources. Although this [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) couldn’t cause XRP to appreciate,
the actual launch may boost its  price.

The limited reaction to the [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) was caused by the ongoing SEC case. The
court  ordered the company to properly search for and turn over video
and audio recordings of its internal meetings.

Now the XRP rate depends on rumors, [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/), and the general market
situation. If the crypto market continues to grow and Ripple wins the
court case, it will see significant gains. But by investing in XRP, you
are buying an increased risk of uncertainty. We would recommend
refraining from buying until the situation with the court is cleared up.

Trading is another matter. XRP’s rate is sensitive to any [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) and
rumors, and it shows significant movement (both growth and decline)
after such. By trading, you can bet on the growth of XRP but also on its
fall.

## XRP Price Prediction for 2021 by Crypto Experts

The decision in the 2020 lawsuit against Ripple's management will most
likely be made no earlier than January 2022.

This case had a dramatic effect on the XRP price, now, the situation is
not so obvious. At the end of 2020, the XRP price fell to a local
minimum of $0.17 while the SEC case was gaining momentum. At the
beginning of April 2021, the XRP value renewed its three-year high at
$1.11 while the court allowed the company to review the internal
documents of the SEC.

On May 4, Ripple plunged as the SEC threatened XRP holders with legal
action. The Commission opposes [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s joining the XRP securities
recognition case. Nevertheless, the fall didn't continue for long, as
the company appointed a former US treasurer to its board. In August, the
XRP value leveled up to $1.25. The Economy Forecast Agency supposes that
the highest price Ripple will achieve in the next few months is $1.64,
which is quite encouraging compared with Ripple’s low in July 2021.

How should [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s behave in such uncertain circumstances? Is Ripple
expected to rise or fall? Look at experts' predictions.

TradingBeasts expects the average [XRP][3] price to stay near $1.58
throughout December. The [website](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/website-for-forex-trading/) sees a strong upward movement at the
end of the year, which is a good sign for traders. The maximum price
will reach $1.98. The minimum price won't fall below $1.30. The XRP
outlook was reviewed by the [website](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/website-for-forex-trading/). Previously, the maximum value was
expected to move above $1.45.

The average price of the XRP will stay above $1.30 in December. Although
the [website](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/website-for-forex-trading/) doesn't predict a strong uptrend, the average price stays at
good levels. The highest price will hit above $1.90 in December. The
minimum rate won't fall below $1. However, the difference between the
low and high price signals increased volatility.

The Ripple forecast of Crypto Ground can't be called promising. The
source predicts a price decline until the end of the year. Still, on the
last day of December, XRP’s rate will be $1.57.

This [website](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/website-for-forex-trading/) projects an uptrend for the XRP/USD pair. According to Coin
Price Forecast, the price may reach $1.68 by the end of the year. The
forecast was reviewed. Just recently the platform expected XRP to be
slightly above $1.

Below, you can check the Ripple coin price prediction by the Economy
Forecast Agency. The source expects an uptrend. The price of the XRP/USD
pair will suffer ups and downs. At the end of the year, the price will
close at $1.53.

## Ripple Technical Analysis

As a technical analysis of big time frames allows us to see the market
situation as a whole, we'll start with [XRPUSD][3] monthly chart.



As shown in the picture above, the chart almost reproduced Ripple's
price [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) in 2018, and steep growth in April 2021 came before as
fast a fall in May-June 2021. Based on XRP price [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/), we can presume
that Ripple's projected value may hold steady at 0.786 Fibonacci of
April's peak, which equals 0.50 USD.

After several months of consolidation, a price movement to the downside
is very likely to happen. A projected fall may unfold down to the growth
bottom at 0.20 US dollars.

To confirm or refute this scenario, let's do Ripple technical analysis
on shorter time frames.

### Ripple price prediction for three months

Let's take a look at XRPUSD weekly price chart.

In the first place, let's compare [Ripple][2]'s current small price
movements with the 2018 scenario. As the chart above suggests, the
current market situation is similar to what was in April 2018, when the
Stochastic [RSI][6] almost reached zero after a reversal at the peak and
a steep correction. Now the situation repeats itself. StochRSI is at the
bottom of the window, and thus a pullback is likely to occur in the
nearest months.

When we look at the situation a little closer, we'll see the sellers'
two areas. The first one is at the peak, at around 2 USD. The other one
is near 1 USD. Those levels are marked with green lines in the chart.

Projected pullbacks are unlikely to break out those levels. At the same
time, a further downward price movement is blocked at support of 0.5
USD, the red line in the price chart above.

Examining the current price movement in the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) chart, we see bullish
counter-volumes. Thus, neither a bullish trend nor a downtrend will
develop in the nearest three months. The Ripple price is blocked in the
range of 0.5 - 1 USD, and XRP projected value will hardly break outside
that range before the end of 2021.

### Ripple price forecast for 2021

Here's a realistic Ripple forecast for the end of 2021.

The price is consolidating in the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) chart above. [Ripple][3]'s
expected trading range isn't likely to break through the current limits
of [[Bollinger Bands](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/bollinger-bands.html)][7]. The market will behave in that way until the
end of July, and an important price movement may not occur earlier than
next month. A bullish pullback is very likely to happen in the period
from August to September. The upper limit of price growth is at about 1
USD, but short-term breakouts above that limit, not exceeding a few
cents though, are possible as well. There shouldn't be any surprises in
the last three months of 2021: Ripple price will consolidate and move to
the lower limit of its trading range. Ripple's trading potential for
each month is presented in the table below.

#### Long-term trading plan for Ripple

A trading plan based on the above scenario may look like the following:

Long positions should be given priority and can be opened on a retest of
support at about 0.50 USD and on a breakout of the level of 0.75 USD
after the end of local consolidation. In both cases, a stop-loss order
shall be placed beyond 0.50 USD. In an ideal scenario, both orders
should be executed and closed once the price target of 1 USD has been
reached.

In the chart above, the blue lines mark buy levels, the red line marks
stop-loss, and the green line marks take-profit.

Be aware of risks when opening such trades! Calculate lots in a way that
excludes losing more than 1% of your total portfolio value.

## Weekly Elliott wave Ripple analysis as of 15.11.2021

The [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) XRPUSD chart displays the corrective trend unfolding as a
simple zigzag. There is forming the middle part of the zigzag,
corrective wave B. Correction B is unfolding as a double zigzag
[W]-[X]-[Y]. This year, the final motive wave [Y] has been unfolding as
a double zigzag (W)-(X)-(Y), which is half-complete. Let us study the
linking wave (X) in the eight-hour timeframe.

The linking wave (X) is forming as a horizontal contracting triangle
composed of sub-waves A-B-C-D-E. The first wave A is a triple zigzag
[W]-[X]-[Y]-[X]-[Z]. The second wave of the triangle, sub-wave B, is a
standard zigzag. Wave C is a double zigzag [W]-[X]-[Y]. There should be
developing the D wave as a simple zigzag [A]-[B]-[C], and the price will
be moving to a level of 1.050 as outlined in the chart.

## Ripple Price Prediction for 2022 by Crypto Experts

Things aren’t less challenging for Ripple now. The price will keep
jumping until the SEC case is solved. Let's see what leading crypto
sources say about the Ripple value in 2022.

TradingBeasts provides a quite optimistic prediction for the XRP rate in
2022. Starting the year at $1.58, the average projected value will move
to $1.62 by December. Although the price isn’t expected to skyrocket, a
solid uptrend is always positive for [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s.

As for Wallet Investor, the Ripple price forecast is also encouraging.
The platform predicts the price will stay above $1.70 most of the year.
By the end of the year, the price will cross  $2. The maximum price
won’t break above $2.50.

Crypto Ground also expects the XRP value to increase. The source sees a
bullish trend in 2022. However, there will be significant declines. By
June, the price will be near $1.28. By the end of 2022, the price will
reach $1.85.

Changelly platform: "Ripple’s price has gained support from some of the
investment biggies, and the number of partnerships and events with
crypto companies shows that many believe in the currency. The recent XRP
price predictions and its price movement might mark a tremendous
improvement by the end of the year, unlike other major coins such as BTC
and ETH, and cross its previous all-time high price of $3.84."

The Economy Forecast Agency has a bullish forecast for Ripple in 2022.
Still, the market will be highly volatile. The price will fluctuate
within the range of $1.53-1.87.

## Ripple Price Prediction for 2023 by Crypto Experts

Moving further, we see that although the price of XRP won’t hit
exclusive highs, the cryptocurrency won’t disappear. What awaits the XRP
coin price in 2023? How much will it cost?

TradingBeasts expects the XRP to decline during the year. The average
exchange rate of the XRP/USD pair will fall from $1.62 to $1.58. The
maximum price will be slightly above $2 until October. The minimum rate
won’t fall below $1.34.

The Wallet Investor [website](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/website-for-forex-trading/) gives a positive forecast about the XRP
future. The average price will stay above $2 during the whole year.
XRP/USD will start the year at $2.23. The price will reach $2.8 by the
last day of 2023.

Crypto Ground is still optimistic about the XRP price. Despite a slight
correction down at the beginning of the year, the cryptocurrency is
anticipated to reach $2.37 by 2024.

The Coin Price Forecast platform expects Ripple to start 2023 at $2.30,
soar to $2.82 within the first six months of the year, and finish 2023
at $3.33.

The Economy Forecast Agency is bearish about Ripple in 2023. The price
will be set at $1.75 in January. The overall downward trend will lead
the coin to $1.23 at the end of the year.

It’s worth mentioning that most experts predict a price increase;
however, before you decide on a long-term investment, you should once
again pay attention to the forecasts, as they may change.

## Long Term Ripple Prediction: 2025-2030

How much will Ripple be worth in 5-10 years? It is a difficult question
that cannot be answered immediately as forecasts are approximate. You
never know what will happen to the price tomorrow. It is, therefore,
best to be aware of the latest Ripple [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/). Then you know what the
project and the community are doing. To have a good understanding of the
[blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) projects, check which developments are planned, which
collaborations they are working on or already exist, how they are
working with the community, and other factors.

Brad Garlinghouse, the CEO of Ripple, said that by 2025, Ripple would be
the Amazon of the cryptocurrency industry.

Crypto Ground believes the cryptocurrency will climb above $3 in 2025
and 2026. The primary trend is bullish. In 2026, the price of XRP may
stay at $3.20.

The Wallet Investor [website](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/website-for-forex-trading/) is positive about XRP in 2025. The average
price will stay above $3 during the year. There is a chance it will
surge to $5 at the end of December 2025. The maximum price will break
above the $4 threshold at the beginning of 2025. As for the first six
months of 2026, the price will fluctuate near $4. An uptrend is expected
in 2025-2026. Still, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s should be careful as market volatility
will be high.

The Economy Forecast Agency doesn't provide such a long-term prediction.
There is only an outlook for 2025 - the price will stay in a range of
$0.69-0.41. It’s the most pessimistic projection. The last time the XRP
was at such low levels was in July 2021.

Coin Price Forecast projections look realistic. XRP is expected to rise
from $4.02 at the beginning of 2025 to $4.76 at the end of 2030. The
rise is limited. Of course, the price will move up and down over the 6
year period. Such long-term forecasts are very approximate as XRP is one
of the most volatile crypto assets.

## Is Ripple a Good Investment?

Should I invest in Ripple? Ripple: buy or sell? Maybe these questions
are still in your head. Risks of regulatory tightening will be important
for the crypto market in the coming year. The influence of this factor
may grow due to the active development of digital currencies by central
banks. Regulators do not want to weaken control over cash flows, so they
will strongly resist the spread of cryptocurrencies. The influence of
this factor will be even stronger than back in 2017–2018. The expected
development of DeFi is another risk for Ripple.

Oddly enough, the coronavirus pandemic can support the virtual market.
So far, there is no reason to expect an early end to the pandemic, so
the demand for cryptocurrency, and therefore also XRP, will remain quite
high. If the dominant driving force in the market had previously been
individuals, then in 2021, it is institutions. Therefore, next year we
will most likely see a smooth rise in the XRP coin. Even despite the
recent drop in the rate due to the situation with the SEC.

The events from April to November 2021 confirmed that the [XRP/USD][3]
pair still has major speculative characteristics due to the court case
and the overall negative dynamics of the crypto market. However, the
XRP/USD pair still produces volume and volatility. The XRP showed it can
triple its capacity, then lose almost everything. It’s a good point for
aggressive traders.

Most experts expect the XRP value to grow if the SEC lawsuit is settled
and the company provides the first crypto IPO.
