BTC Price Predictions and Analysis: Bitcoin Price Breakout!Jana Kane

Bitcoin breaks a price record again! The coin set a new all-time high of
$66,930.39 on October 20, 2021. How did this advance come about? BTC
broke above $60,000 in March 2021, and after a short-lived drop,
continued moving upward. It has been a turbulent year, both inside and
outside the Bitcoin scene. Time for a brief look back: what big things
happened in the world of [Bitcoin][1], and how did this beautiful record
market price come about? And what can we expect from the crypto-king
next? Will  Bitcoin go up even more? Let's find out in our Bitcoin coin
review!

The article covers the following subjects:

## Bitcoin in Short

We're sure you know, but Bitcoin is the best-known digital currency
(also known as cryptocurrency). It was the very first decentralized
currency that works by means of [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) technology. The native token
was launched in 2009, in the midst of a global financial crisis. Because
many people were suspicious of banks, Bitcoin immediately won the
interest of a large group of people.

The system allows you to send "money" to someone else without the
intervention of a third party. The data is not managed by one person but
by all users of the network. This makes it one large decentralized
database of transactions.

## Bitcoin Price History Before 2021

First of all, let’s address the price development of [Bitcoin][1] since
the beginning. In the image below, you can clearly see the various major
events and the price increase.



But let’s take a closer look at Bitcoin in 2020.

### Bitcoin Crash in March 2020

2020 started with bad [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/). From February to March, Bitcoin fell from
over $10,000 to below $4,000. However, the crash wasn’t just in the
crypto market. It was a full-on economic recession because of the COVID
pandemic. For example, the AEX (the stock market index) closed with the
largest drop since 1987, a drop of more than 10%.

### Bitcoin Halving in May 2020

The halving event happened on May 11. The new reward per block was set
at 6.25 BTC, which was the new era for Bitcoin. So, the number of
[bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)s circulating became even scarcer, which also coincided with
people receiving their stimulus and money packages. Because of the
higher demand and lower supply, the price rose.

### Bitcoin Core Update in June 2020

The next on the Bitcoin [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) were changes within the network. As
upgrades usually cause price increases, they’re important [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/). Bitcoin
Core is responsible for everything in the ecosystem, the update for
which was released on June 28 by 119 developers. OpenSSL was removed
from the code to increase the security of the protocol and reduce
vulnerabilities to attacks.

### BTC Banking in July 2020

The Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), which supervises the national
banks, allowed US banks to offer Bitcoin services. The first companies
to jump on this [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) were Avanti, Kraken, BitPay, and Paxos. All of them
applied for a license and bank charter.

### MicroStrategy in August 2020

The most bullish [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) of 2020 came in August when the business
intelligence company MicroStrategy purchased [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)s worth about $250
million. The reason was the Inflation Ghost.

### BitMEX and PayPal October 2020

The most shocking [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) of October came from the derivatives platform
BitMEX. The exchange has been sued by the US Commodity Futures Trading
Commission (CFTC). According to the CFTC, BitMEX was operating without
proper licenses. It was also accused of manipulating the market, which
doesn’t look good for the price of Bitcoin.

On the plus side, PayPal opened its doors to Bitcoin the same month.
Anytime a billion-dollar company starts accepting cryptocurrency, it
pushes the market forward and causes a price increase. It’s also
important to note that PayPal bought up about 70% of the newly mined
Bitcoins.

### Institutional Money in December 2020

MicroStrategy made the first influx of institutional money at the end of
2020, which was followed by Square, Stone Ridge, MassMutual, Guggenheim
Partners, Grayscale, and Ruffer Investment. In total, the investments
were in the hundreds of millions USD. MicroStrategy raised $650 million
in debt securities and, since then, successfully turned that cash into
Bitcoin. This prompted a price increase, with BTC rallying above $24,000
during that period.

## Bitcoin Price Development in 2021

Why is Bitcoin going up? Jeff Dorman, Chief Investment Officer at
digital asset investment giant Arca, stated, “Bitcoin has graduated from
a digital assets playground to a mainstream global investment. Investors
now have the knowledge and means to buy Bitcoin themselves, and we are
seeing it in real-time, which happened quicker than we anticipated.”

But if you want more insight into what pushed Bitcoin's value in 2021,
below is a further description of Bitcoin’s [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) price charts.

### Crash Prompted by the FCA in January 2021

The BTC/USD pair took a plunge at the beginning of 2021 due to
[regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/) issues. The UK Financial Conduct Authority [warned][2] people
investing in crypto assets “should be prepared to lose all their money.”
As a result, around $175 billion in market value was wiped off the
market.

FCA Chief Mr. Bailey was sure that “Bitcoin's days [were] numbered.” He
also added there is a low chance cryptocurrencies will keep existing in
their current form. Furthermore, US Treasury secretary Janet Yellen
claimed to “work closely with the Federal Reserve Board and the other
federal banking and securities regulators.” Such comments signaled
tougher conditions for cryptocurrencies in general.

### Boost From Tesla in February 2021

The question of whether Bitcoin would go back up worried [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s.
Fortunately, Elon Musk mentioned Bitcoin on Twitter, and within a day,
the price skyrocketed by 11%. Also, Tesla mentioned it purchased $1.5
billion worth of Bitcoin in an SEC filing, driving the price over
$48,000.

### Coinbase’s Listing in April 2021

Bitcoin hit a new record of over $63,000 in April, a day before
Coinbase’s share listing in the United States. Coinbase is the
[cryptocurrency exchange](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/best-cryptocurrency-exchange/) in the US, and its listing on Nasdaq was a
landmark victory for crypto advocates. This [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) had a positive impact
on other cryptocurrencies as well, including Ethereum.

### Mining Ban in China in May 2021

China’s cabinet vowed to crack down on Bitcoin mining, trying to
mitigate financial risks and sending Bitcoin tumbling. Over the course
of several weeks in May, BTC fell from over $58,000 to around $32,000.
At this point, China’s share of global BTC mining has fallen to
effectively zero.

### New Narrative in July 2021

In July, the price of Bitcoin crashed below $30,000. This was the time
when the ESG (environmental, social, and governance factors) narrative
dragged the mood in the market down. Bitcoin also suffered from the
Financial Action Task Force’s negative regulatory undertones. These
stories began to affect the global economy - the sentiment fell to
single-digit levels at the time.

### Full Ban on Cryptocurrencies in China in September 2021

Cryptocurrency trading has been illegal in China since 2019, but it
continued through foreign exchanges. This time, the official declared a
full ban. The People's Bank of China said: “Virtual currency-related
business activities are illegal financial activities.” Within a few
days, the price of Bitcoin fell by more than $4,000.

### Regulatory Recognition in October 2021

U.S. Bank, the fifth-largest retail bank in the USA, launched its
Bitcoin custody service for fund managers. On top of it, the Biden
administration might release an executive order to direct federal
agencies. If this goes into effect, they will be ready to study and
offer recommendations on the crypto market, which is great [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) for
traders.

“It’s a validating moment,” said Jesse Proudman, co-founder and CEO at
Makara. “I think that’s a really meaningful mark in the [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) of the
broader digital-asset class.”

Bitcoin price today is $63 708.10.

## Bitcoin Technical Analysis

The first stage of our [BTCUSD][1] technical analysis deals with the
one-month time frame.

The [BTC/USD][1] price [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) over a few past years is shown in the
chart above. We see a gradual stable bullish trend that started in 2017.

Cryptocurrencies' second life started in October 2020 when trading
volumes grew and [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) highs were retested against a backdrop of
the previous years' calm.

[Bitcoin][1]'s price has been growing steeply since then. Thinking this
situation will last forever would be naive. We have to figure out when
the BTC coin will reverse again to buy some [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)s.

### BTC price prediction for the next three months

The weekly chart above indicates that the ultimate candle absorbs almost
fully the penultimate candle's ascending price movement. That's a
bearish signal.

The [BTC/USD][1] price location increases negative sentiment. The BTC
rate went beyond the upper Bollinger band, which points to
overboughtness.

The RSI is overheated too and indicates a bearish divergence.

The limits of a projected fall are marked in the [BTC/USD][1] price
chart. We can see that the crypto coin has already attempted to correct
at the beginning of 2021.

Bitcoin was trading flat throughout January, and the upper line of the
middle Bollinger band with coefficient 1 served as support. I don't have
many reasons to say that fractal won't repeat again. Strong support will
then be located at around 42,000.

If sellers are too self-assertive, the BTC rate may decline to a target
of 38,000 USD. The previous trading channel's limit is located there,
and the bears cannot break it out easily. Since the bullish trend isn't
broken, such a pullback may turn to the [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) high's retest.

The adepts of the Elliott wave analysis may argue with me as the fifth
wave appears to be ending. However, the market is inert, especially
after a rise that big. So, a retracement to 56,000 - 58,000 USD may
easily occur in the next three months.

### What will be the price of Bitcoin in 2021?

Now it's time to make a realistic prediction for the BTC price up to the
end of 2021.

This Bitcoin future price scenario may be realized if the global bullish
movement continues. If the price drops below 38,000 USD, I will have to
revise this outlook.

Thus, consolidation has seemed to be the likeliest scenario so far. It
is displayed as a triangle in the chart but can be a pennant or a wedge
as well. Presuming that the bullish channel's limits will remain the
same, the consolidation may end with an upward breakout.

The [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) maximum of 58,200 dollars for 1 Bitcoin may then become a
serious obstacle. If that level is broken out, we are very likely to see
sharp ascending momentum, something similar to the [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) peak's
breakout at 20,000 USD. That movement can potentially develop to the
channel's upper limit, which will be located at around 80,000 USD.

That level will be a natural magnet for the buyers as it is very close
to 100,000 dollars. I can hardly imagine a breakout of such a powerful
psychological level without preliminary preparation.

Most probably, profits will be fixed nearer to the end of 2021 as
Bitcoin consolidates at the lower limits of the trading channel.

By projecting [Bollinger Bands](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/bollinger-bands.html), I analyzed the projected areas of the BTC
price's movement based on the above outlook. Check the prediction chart
of BTC/USD above. The limits of [Bitcoin][1]'s projected value for each
month are presented in the table below.

Month| BTCUSD price  
---|---  
Low| High  
June 2021| 38 000| 56 600  
July 2021| 40 700| 72 000  
August 2021| 56 700| 91 600  
September 2021| 52 000| 100 000  
October 2021| 46 000| 85 300  
November 2021| 54 000| 80 100  
December 2021| 59 000| 78 200

## Weekly Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis as of 15.11.2021

The [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) BTCUSD chart displays the structure of the second half of the
global impulse (A) developing as a corrective trend of a larger degree.
Wave (A) is composed of sub-waves 1-2-3-4-5. The first four legs have
completed. There is unfolding the final sub-wave 5 as a simple five-wave
impulse [1]-[2]-[3]-[4]-[5], which should soon be concluded by sub-wave
[5]. The final leg of the wave [5] is now forming. Let us explore the
most recent chart section in the eight-hour chart.

Let us study the structure of wave [5] composed of sub-waves
(1)-(2)-(3)-(4)-(5). Sub-waves (1)-(2)-(3)-(4) have completed. The final
wave (5) is unfolding as an impulse 1-2-3-4-5 of a smaller degree. Wave
5 could be developing as an ending diagonal, which should finish at a
level of around 69800.00. After this level is reached by the price, the
market could turn down and start declining in a new trend.

### Weekly [BTCUSD][1] trading plan:

## Bitcoin Price Predictions for 2021-2022 by Crypto Experts

Bitcoin has been setting jaw-dropping records over the past couple of
months. 2021 has been an amazing year for Bitcoin, and many experts are
already predicting what the future will bring for this cryptocurrency.

If the current price is at $63 708.10, what is the Bitcoin future value?

Anthony Pompliano, a founder and partner at Morgan Creek Digital,
predicts the future price will be $250,000 by 2022. Let’s see if other
sources share the same outlook.

### Standard Chartered Bank

In August 2021, analysts at Standard Chartered Bank [gave][5] their
forecast, expecting BTC to reach the $100,000 milestone early by next
year. This reflects the opinions of many other crypto experts. For
instance, Nick Spanos, co-founder of decentralized network Zap.org, also
[believes][6] that Bitcoin will hit $100,000 in the near future.

### Token Metrics

Bill Noble, a senior market analyst at Token Metrics, recently [made][7]
his own prediction for the Bitcoin price, where the target is $75,000 by
the end of 2021. But he also highlighted the possibility of the price
drop, even down to $25,000.

### Tim Draper

Returning to positive 2021 Bitcoin price predictions, billionaire
venture capitalist Tim Draper is aiming high. A while back, sometime in
2020, he made a prediction saying that BTC will hit $250,000. In
mid-2021, he confirmed that he’s sticking to his original outlook for
the end of 2022.

Long Forecast posted a small but informative forecast for the last
months of 2021, expecting the price to go up to the $66,332-$72,186
range.

But let’s close this section on a more positive note. Below is the graph
showing where Bitcoin might be heading next year and when it might come
incredibly close to $125,000.

## Bitcoin Price Prediction 2023-2024

How much will Bitcoin cost in 2023? Will Bitcoin manage to stick to new
highs in 2023?

Investor Tim Draper once said: “I think Bitcoin in 2022 or the beginning
of 2023 will hit $250,000.” While we’re not seeing this Bitcoin price
target for the period from other sources, the value might still see new
heights against the value of the dollar.

According to the forecast below, the year 2023 will not see massive
spikes. The average price range might stay at around $61,000-$63,000.

In addition to the month-by-month tables, we also have price charts
speculating on Bitcoin’s movement in 2023-2024. Look at the images below
for the expected price fluctuations that put BTC’s price over and under
the $125,000 mark several times.

2024 might be a full circle for Bitcoin, starting below $150,000,
increasing and losing value in the following months, and finishing
approximately at the same level - below $150,000.

## Long-Term Bitcoin Prediction in 2025-2030

Is Bitcoin expected to rise? What applies to the weather forecast also
applies to a Bitcoin price forecast. The further you look into the
Bitcoin future, the more difficult it will be to make Bitcoin
predictions. In 2025, the world may look very different from what we now
sketch. Nevertheless, we make an attempt. What will 2025 bring for
Bitcoin?

Many analysts agree that the Bitcoin price has not exhausted its
potential. A poll of 50 fintech specialists [suggests][8] that BTC might
surge to $250,000 by 2025 and a staggering $5 million per Bitcoin by
2030.

Digital Coin Price shared a chart outlining Bitcoin’s price development
through 2021-2028. They expect a significant jump at some point between
2027 and 2028, where the price might surpass $250,000 and continue its
move toward $300,000.

Here is another ​prediction of the price of Bitcoin in 2025-2030. This
source believes that BTC can go into millions. 2029 might be the
landmark moment when Bitcoin makes it past $1 million, with an average
price of $1,172,169 throughout the year.

FX Empire released a collection of opinions about the Bitcoin exchange
rate forecast for 2025  and 2030. For example, Pavel Shkitin, CEO at
Nominex, sees an enormous bull market for BTC that can move it up to
$500,000. Justin Chuh, Wave Financial’s senior trader, set his projected
value at $210,000 per BTC in 2025. Ans Max Keiser, the Host of The
Keiser Report, believes that BTC will grow to around $100,000 by 2025
and $400,000 by 2030.

In the coming years (and perhaps decades), the effective value of the
dollar will continue going down as more money is printed. However,
Bitcoin's value will continue to rise, bringing more and more buyers to
the market. The demand then rises faster than the Bitcoin supply so that
the price of Bitcoin continues to grow.

## Is Bitcoin a Good Investment?

Should I invest in Bitcoin? Now you may have this question in your mind.
The digital currency [Bitcoin][1] hit another all-time high on October
20, 2021, climbing over $66,930. The strong advance of the
cryptocurrency to a new record high does not seem to be coming to an end
for the time being. So – Bitcoin: buy or sell?

Back in 2017-2018, people thought that Bitcoin coming close to $20,000
was the end. But the digital currency proved multiple times that it
could overcome new barriers, even after massive drops. So, Bitcoin could
be a good investment going further.

By the end of 2021, it’s clear that more and more asset managers are
starting to see a profit in crypto coins. Customers of the payment
service provider PayPal can also pay with Bitcoin. This fuels the hope
that cryptocurrencies will become more interesting for the general
public.

However, the [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s’ optimism becomes even stronger when price
targets from analysts - over $100,000 and even $250,000. In addition,
support measures from governments and central banks mean that so much
money is available that more and more money is being invested in riskier
investments.

Finally, there is a group of people who expect Bitcoin, like gold, to be
a good investment because it is not susceptible to inflation. The
current advance started last year. The digital currency then roughly
quadrupled in value, according to data from [Coinmarketcap](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/coinmarketcap-creator/).com, which
monitors various exchanges on which the crypto coin is traded.

## Bitcoin Price Prediction FAQ

Is it good to buy Bitcoin now?

How high will Bitcoin go? Bitcoin recently hit its all-time high, and
the current Bitcoin price is at $63 708.10. Usually, it’s a better idea
to buy cryptocurrencies when they are in a dip. However, we all remember
how “it was too late” to buy BTC when it was $20, $100, $1000, $20,000,
etc. If forecasts come true, the price may reach $300,000. The Bitcoin
potential is strong for sure.
