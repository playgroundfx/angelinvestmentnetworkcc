Economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the week 22.02.2021 – 28.02.2021Jana Kane

##  **Review of the main events of the Forex economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the
next trading week (22.02.2021 – 28.02.2021)**

 **Trading on key Forex [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/): next week we expect the publication of
important macro statistics from China, New Zealand, Australia, US,
Germany, Great Britain, Switzerland, speeches of the heads of the
central banks of Canada, the Eurozone, and the US, as well as the
results of the meetings of the National Bank of China and the Reserve
Bank of New Zealand.**

Despite the growth on Friday, the American stock indexes ended the last
week mostly with a decline. Despite the lingering optimism, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s
and stock indices seem to have decided to take a break before storming
new record levels. The dollar also declined last week, significantly
yielding its positions primarily to major commodity currencies such as
the Canadian, New Zealand and Australian dollars. The DXY dollar index
improved over the past week by 0.2% after falling 0.6% in the previous
week.

Positive macro data from the US released last week contribute to the
strengthening of positive [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) sentiment regarding the recovery of
the US economy. The data indicate that US business activity continued to
show strong growth in February amid a rebound in services and continued
industrial output, while consumer retail spending rose in January and
peaked in seven months thanks to stimulus payments. Some economists have
improved their estimates of US Q1 GDP growth given projected fiscal
stimulus and a resumption of normal economic activity amid the retreat
of the pandemic.

Next week, financial market participants will pay attention to the
publication of important macro statistics from China, New Zealand,
Australia, US, Germany, Great Britain, Switzerland, speeches of the
heads of the central banks of Canada, the Eurozone, and the US, as well
as to the results of the meetings of the National Bank of China and the
Reserve Bank of New Zealand.

 **Traders should pay attention to the publication of the following
macro indicators:**

 ***during the coming week, new events may be added to the [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) and
/ or some scheduled events may be canceled**

 ****GMT time**

###  **Monday, February 22**

###  **01:30 CNY Decision of the People's Bank of China on the interest
rate**

Since May 2012, the People's Bank of China has been steadily cutting
interest rates in support of Chinese manufacturers. The last time in
2020 the bank cut the rate was in April (by 0.20% to 3.85% at the
moment).

In 2020, amid international trade conflicts and a slowdown in the global
economy, the world's largest central banks took the path of easing their
monetary policies in order to support national economies and increase
the competitiveness of goods exported from these countries.

The People's Bank of China is also in line with this process. The
depreciation of the yuan became especially relevant in the last 2 years,
when the confrontation between the two most powerful economies in the
world began. One of the measures to neutralize the negative consequences
of the increased duties on the import of Chinese goods into the United
States was the depreciation of the national currency of China. This
measure was intended, among other things, to maintain the same volumes
of imports of Chinese products to the United States, which would cost
American buyers less due to the difference in the rates of the national
currencies of the United States and China.

Now, another strong negative factor has been added to this - the
coronavirus pandemic.

Probably, at this meeting, the People's Bank of China will keep the
interest rate at the same level of 3.85%, although a rate cut is also
possible.

However, if the People's Bank of China makes unexpected statements or
decisions, volatility may increase throughout the financial market.
Investors will also be interested in the bank's assessment of the
consequences of the coronavirus for the Chinese economy and its [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
in the near future in this regard.

###  **After 09:00 (exact time unknown) GBP Speech by British Prime
Minister Boris Johnson**

Johnson is expected to announce new prospects for the country and its
economy after Brexit in his speech on government plans. The main risks
for the UK after Brexit are associated with expectations of a slowdown
in the country's economic growth, as well as with a large current
account deficit in the UK balance of payments. Volatility in the pound
quotes and in the British stock market may sharply increase if Johnson
makes unexpected statements during his speech regarding the domestic and
foreign [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the UK, as well as the prospects for its economy.

###  **13:45 EUR Speech by the ECB President Christine Lagarde**

During the speech by the head of the ECB Christine Lagarde, the
volatility increases not only in the euro and European stock indices,
but throughout the financial market, especially if she touches on the
topic of the ECB's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). Any hints at curtailing the QE
program in the Eurozone will cause the euro to rise. The soft tone of
Christine Lagarde's speech and the intention to continue the extra soft
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the ECB will negatively affect the euro.

Speeches of the head of the ECB after the meetings of the bank have a
particularly strong influence on the market. In previous periods, the
speech of the head of the ECB in similar situations could cause a change
in the euro exchange rate by more than 3%. If Christine Lagarde does not
touch upon the ECB's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), the reaction to her speech will be
weak.

###  **21:45 NZD Retail Sales (Q4)**

The Retail Sales Report is published by Statistics New Zealand. Changes
in retail sales are generally considered an indicator of consumer
spending. In general, a high value is a positive factor for the NZD,
while a low reading is a negative factor. Q3 2020 retail sales grew +28%
after falling -14.8% in Q2 and -1.2% in Q1 due to Covid quarantine
restrictions -19. The NZD will strengthen if the data is better than
previous values. A weak report will negatively affect the NZD. Forecast:
+26.7%.

###  **Tuesday, February 23**

###  **07:00 GBP Report on the average wages of the British citizens for
the last 3 months. Unemployment rate**

On a monthly basis, the UK Office for National Statistics (ONS)
publishes a report on average earnings covering the last 3 months, with
and without bonuses.

This report is a key short-term indicator of the dynamics of changes in
the level of wages of employees in the UK. Wages growth is positive for
the GBP, while a low value is negative. Forecast: The February report
suggests that the average wages with bonuses increased over the last
calculated 3 months (October-December) by +2.9% (against +3.6%, +2.7%,
+1.3% , +0.1%, -1.0%, -1.2%, -0.3%, +1.0%, +2.4%, +2.8%, +3.1%, +2.9%,
+3.2%, +3.2% in previous periods); without bonuses - increased by +3.2%
(against +3.6%, +2.8%, +1.9%, +0.9%, +0.2%, -0.2%, +0.7%, +1.7%, +2.7%,
+2.9%, +3.1%, +3.2%, +3.4%, +3.5% in previous periods). Thus, the
expected data is close to the average values ​​of the indicators. If the
data turns out to be better than forecast, the pound is likely to
strengthen in the foreign exchange market in the short term. The data
worse than the forecast will negatively affect the pound.

Also at this time, data on unemployment in the UK are published. It is
expected that in the 3 months from October to December, unemployment was
at 5.1% (against 5.0%, 4.9%, 4.8%, 4.5%, 4.3%, 3.9%, 3.9%, 3.9%, 3.9%,
4.0%, 3.9% and 3.8% in previous periods). Since 2012, the UK
unemployment rate has declined steadily (from 8.0% in September 2012).
This is a positive factor for the pound, while unemployment growth is a
negative factor.

If the data from the UK labor market turn out to be worse than the
forecast and / or the previous value, the pound will be under pressure.

In any case, at the time of the publication of data from the British
labor market, an increase in volatility in the pound quotes and on the
London Stock Exchange is expected.

###  **17:30 CAD Speech by the head of the Bank of Canada Tiff Macklem**

The Canadian economy, as well as the entire global economy, slowed down
in 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic. Earlier, Tiff Macklem said that
the Canadian economy is quite stable. However, the situation has changed
rapidly, and not for the better. It will be interesting now to listen to
Macklem's opinion on the sustainability of the Canadian economy and the
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the central bank.

If Tiff Macklem touches on the topic of the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the Bank
of Canada, the volatility in the quotes of the Canadian dollar will rise
sharply. His tough tone will help strengthen the Canadian dollar. The
soft rhetoric of Macklem's speech and the intention to pursue soft
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) will negatively affect the CAD quotes.

Probably, he can also provide some guidelines for [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s on the eve
of the next meeting of the Bank of Canada, which will be held on March
10.

###  **Wednesday, February 24**

###  **01:00 NZD RB of New Zealand's decision on the interest rate.
Accompanying statement of the RBNZ. Monetary Policy Account**

After the bank's management decided to cut the rate by 0.75% during an
unscheduled meeting on March 15, the current interest rate of the
Reserve Bank of New Zealand is at 0.25%. The bank's management explained
its decision by the loss of momentum in the New Zealand economy and a
sharp slowdown in the global economy amid the coronavirus pandemic.

"Global economic activity continues to weaken, reducing demand for goods
and services from New Zealand. Increased uncertainty and contraction in
international trade are contributing to a decline in economic growth in
trading partner countries," a recent statement from the RBNZ said.

The RBNZ believes that wages growth remains weak. At the same time,
inflationary expectations are falling, and low levels of business
confidence indicate a slowdown in hiring and wage growth.

Slower economic growth (New Zealand's GDP growth has slowed since the
second half of 2018) and a weakening labor market, as well as escalating
international trade wars and a deteriorating global economic outlook,
are forcing the Reserve Bank of New Zealand to keep interest rates low.
An additional and unforeseen risk to the global and New Zealand
economies is the coronavirus epidemic.

It is expected that at this meeting, the RBNZ will not cut or raise the
rate yet, but may speak in favor of lowering it in the coming months if
the economic situation in the country and in the world worsens.

In the accompanying statement and comments, the RBNZ management will
provide an explanation of the decision on the interest rate and comments
on the economic conditions that facilitated the adoption of this
decision.

At this time, the volatility in the quotations of the New Zealand dollar
may rise sharply.

Earlier, the RBNZ stated that against the background of "many factors of
uncertainty" monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) "will remain soft for the foreseeable
future," but "may be adjusted accordingly." According to the bank's
management, for a stable recovery of the New Zealand economy and
inflation growth, "a lower rate of the New Zealand dollar is necessary."

Probably, the head of the RBNZ Adrian Orr will reaffirm the bank's
intention to pursue a soft monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), which will lead to continued
pressure on the New Zealand currency.

###  **02:00 NZD Press conference of the RBNZ**

During the press conference, the head of the RBNZ Adrian Orr will
explain the bank's decision. His speeches often serve as an unofficial
source of information on the future direction of the RBNZ's monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). In his opinion, the country's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) should correlate
with the dynamics of employment and financial stability of the state.

Earlier, the RBNZ stated that against the background of "many factors of
uncertainty" monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) "will remain soft for the foreseeable
future," but "may be adjusted accordingly." For a stable recovery of the
New Zealand economy and rising inflation, "a weaker NZ dollar is
needed."

It is likely that the head of the RBNZ Adrian Orr will reaffirm the
bank's intention to pursue a soft monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), which will lead to
continued pressure on the New Zealand currency.

In any case, volatility is expected to increase in the New Zealand
dollar trade during the RBNZ press conference.

###  **15:00 USD The Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's speech in Congress**

Powell's comments could have an impact on both short-term and long-term
USD trading if he revisits the Fed's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). A more “hawkish”
stance on the Fed's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) is seen as positive and
strengthening the US dollar, while a more cautious position is seen as
negative for the USD.

Recently, more and more statements have been made by the Fed leaders
about the need to continue stimulating the economy badly affected by the
coronavirus.

This time, the head of the Fed Jerome Powell will speak in Congress on
economics and monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).

If he makes unexpected statements, the volatility in trading in the
financial markets may increase. Any hints by Powell about the need for
soft [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) will cause the dollar to fall and the American stock markets
to grow.

Thus, participants in the financial market will carefully study his
speech in order to catch signals from him regarding the further actions
of the Fed.

###  **Thursday, February 25**

###  **13:30 USD Durable goods orders. Capital goods orders (ex defense
and aviation). US Annual GDP for 4th Quarter (second estimate)**

This indicator reflects the value of orders received by manufacturers of
durable goods and capital goods (capital goods are durable commodities
used to produce durable goods and services) involving large investments.
Commodities produced in the defense and aviation sectors of the US
economy are not included in this indicator. A strong result strengthens
the USD. Previous values ​​of the indicator "orders for durable goods":
+0.5% in December, +1.2% in November, +1.8% in October, -18.3% in April,
-16.7% in March , +2.0% in February, -0.2% in January 2020.

Previous values ​​of the indicator "orders for capital goods ex defense
and aviation": +0.7% in December, +1.0% in November, +1.9% in September,
+2.1% in August, -6.6% in April, -1.3% in March, -0.6% in February,
+0.9% in January 2020.

In theory, the relative growth of the indicator has a positive effect on
the dollar; the market reaction to its negative value may be negative
for the dollar in the short term. Data worse than the previous value
will also negatively affect the dollar quotes.

Forecast for January: +1.1% (orders for durable goods), +0.4% (orders
for capital goods ex defense and aviation).

It seems that the growth of indicators continues after their recovery in
previous months from a strong fall in March and April 2020, which should
have a positive effect on the dollar quotes. Better-than-expected data
will also have a positive impact on the dollar.

GDP data is one of the key indicators (along with labor market and
inflation data) for the Fed in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of its monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). Strong
result strengthens US dollar; weak GDP report negatively affects the US
dollar. In the previous 3rd quarter, GDP grew by +33.4% after falling by
-31.4% in the 2nd quarter and by -5.0% in the 1st quarter of 2020.

If the data point to another decline in GDP in the 4th quarter, the
dollar will be under pressure. The positive data on GDP will support the
dollar and the American stock indices, although they are already mostly
included in prices. The preliminary forecast for the 4th quarter of 2020
was +4.0%.

###  **Friday, February 26**

###  **08:00 CHF Switzerland GDP for the 4th quarter**

GDP is considered to be an indicator of the general state of a country's
economy and assesses the rate of its growth or decline. The Gross
Domestic Product Statement expresses in monetary [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) the aggregate
value of all final goods and services produced by Switzerland over a
given period of time. An upward trend in GDP is considered a positive
factor for the national currency (franc), while a low result is
considered negative (or bearish).

In the previous 3rd quarter of 2020, GDP grew by +7.2%, following a
decrease of -7.0% in the 2nd quarter and a decrease of -2.5% in the 1st
quarter of 2020. Switzerland's gross domestic product and economy seem
to be recovering after their fall in the first half of 2020, although
this decline is no match for the decline in GDP in Germany, the Eurozone
and the United States. Switzerland's GDP is forecast to grow +0.1% in
the 4th quarter of 2020 (but declined -2% on an annualized basis). The
data indicate a slowdown in the recovery of the Swiss economy, which is
a negative factor for the franc.

If the data turn out to be weaker than the forecast, the franc may
decline in the short term. However, one should not expect a strong fall
in the franc, as it is in active demand as a defensive asset. Better-
than-forecast data may strengthen the franc in the short term.
