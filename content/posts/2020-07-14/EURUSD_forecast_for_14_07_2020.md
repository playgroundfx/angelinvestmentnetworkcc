EUR/USD forecast: Dollar lost the fearDmitri Demidenko

## Fundamental US dollar forecast for today

### What was the benefit of the USD index yesterday can become its flaw
tomorrow

What is good for the entire world is bad for the US dollar. The pandemic
is still the major growth driver of the greenback. The US stock indexes
are weighed on by the difficult epidemiological situation in the U.S.
and the [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) that California cancels plans to open economy. It supports
the demand for safe havens and so, the dollar remains strong. However,
based on the assumption that COVID-19 will be defeated, the long-term
prospects for the US dollar look gloomy.

During the turmoil, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s buy out safe havens. However, once the
markets calm down, the safe havens lose their appeal. The balance of the
Fed's foreign exchange swaps with other central banks, designed to
provide them with the dollar liquidity, dropped to $153 billion from
$449 billion in late May. Global stock indexes have stabilized, nobody
needs the greenback any more.

Having cut the interest rates to 0%-0.25%, the Fed returned the US
dollar the status of the main safe haven, which strengthened the
greenback when [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s were guided by fear. However, when the global
GDP started to recover from the recession, yesterday’s benefit turns
into a flaw. The dollar has lost such a growth driver as high government
bond yields, which sets back the capital inflow into the US. Foreign
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s become more interested in China’s assets than in US
securities. Foreign [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s bought $619 billion of Chinese government
bonds in the second quarter, it is the highest amount on record.

And the US desperately needs money! The U.S. budget deficit reached $3
trillion in the 12 months through June. The Congressional Budget Office
expects it will be $ 3.7 billion this fiscal year. Besides, another
round of emergency spending, suggested by the White House, will increase
the US budget deficit, as well as the issuance volumes. How can they
raise resources if foreign [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are increasingly buying bonds
issued by the Chinese government?

In addition to the drop in the demand for safe havens and dollar
liquidity, low Treasury yields, and problems with raising capital, the
greenback is weighed on by growing Joe Biden's approval ratings and
concerns about a decline in the US domestic data. It is expected that
the Democratic president will not attack Beijing so much and write
provocative tweets as Donald Trump does. Remember, the US-China trade
war was one of the major dollar’s growth drivers in 2018-2019.

Therefore, there are quite many long-term negative factors affecting the
US dollar, that is why its one-year risk reversals are down.

In the short run, the greenback is supported by the pandemic, and the
euro is weighed on by the uncertainty around the outcomes of the ECB
meeting and the EU summit, as well as the upcoming report on the Chinese
GDP. The current [EUR/USD][3] consolidation in the narrow range of
1.125-1.14 is quite natural. Investors do not want to take important
decisions ahead of the release of the important information in the week
through July 17. We shall also wait and see.
