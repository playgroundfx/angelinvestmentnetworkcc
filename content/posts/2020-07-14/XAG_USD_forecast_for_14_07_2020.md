XAG/USD forecast: Silver has two growth driversDmitri Demidenko

## Fundamental silver price forecast for today

### Open and add to the XAG/USD positions according to the Chinese GDP
data

A small market has big shocks. During a recession, silver price trends
usually follow those of gold, as the gold market is more stable amid the
bigger scales. However, silver usually outperforms gold during the
periods of the global GDP recovery. That was so during the previous
crisis of 2007-2009. That is going to be now unless the global economic
recovery trend is W-shaped.

Silver has two growth drivers, the investment demand and the industrial
demand. Silver is widely used in solar panel production, medical
equipment, household appliances. That is why the silver price was rising
fast in the May-July period amid the reopening of plants and factories
all over the world. The [XAG/USD][1] has been corrected down from its
three-year highs, as California may not exit the lockdown, and [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s
are concerned that the industrial production in China is not recovering
as fast as before.

### Dynamics of China’s industrial production

In the [previous silver analytics][3], I covered the structure of the
silver demand in detail, stressing the leading role of China in forming
the bull market. Will China save the world’s economy as it did in
2009-2011? China’s GDP was hit more in the current recession than in the
previous crisis. However, the fiscal and monetary stimulus is not so
huge. China is now more self-sufficient in some sectors than before, so,
it can buy less. Not my opinion, Beijing will not hold back. There is a
great opportunity to outperform the USA, whose economy was greatly
pressed down by the pandemic. Why not take advantage of it?

The growth in China’s demand is a positive factor for silver, as well as
an increase in the holdings of silver [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/)s. The assets held by one of
the largest silver [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/)s iShares Silver Trust have increased by $ 2.45
billion to $ 9.72 billion since early 2020. Low Treasury yields and the
weakness of the US dollar due to the Fed’s monetary stimulus increase
investment demand for silver.

The growth of precious metals prices usually pushes up the demand for
bars, coins, and [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/) products. However, the demand for jewelry declines
at the same time. However, gold now seems overvalued, which could
support the silver uptrend. The loss in the jewelry demand will not be
as bad as for gold, as consumers will be more willing to buy a cheaper
metal.

The [XAG/USD][1] bulls are also supported by the drop in silver supply.
Mexico, Peru, Chile, Argentina, and the USA are among the largest
producers of silver. The difficult epidemiological situation in the
Americas is the reason for the factory closures, the reduction in
production, and an increase in the deficit.

### Volumes of silver production

Therefore, the [XAG/USD][1] uptrend has strong fundamental reasons,
which suggests silver should continue its rally towards $20 and $23 per
ounce. It will be relevant to add to silver longs entered at $18.2 and
$18.45 [in late June][3] if the report on China's GDP for the second
quarter is strong.
