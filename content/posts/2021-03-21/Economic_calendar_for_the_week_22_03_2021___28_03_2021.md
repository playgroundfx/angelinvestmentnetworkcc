Economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the week 22.03.2021 – 28.03.2021Jana Kane

##  **Review of the main events of the Forex economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the
next trading week (22.03.2021 – 28.03.2021)**

 **Trading on key Forex [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/): next week we are expecting the publication
of important macro statistics from the UK, Germany, the Eurozone, the
United States, as well as the results of the meetings of the central
banks of China and Switzerland.**

The yield on 10-year US government bonds this week reached a new
14-month high of 1.751%. Following the meeting that ended last
Wednesday, the Fed leaders did not change the parameters of monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), signaling that the interest rate will remain at minimum levels
until the end of 2023, and that they are not very concerned about the
growth of government bond yields. At the subsequent press conference,
the Fed Chairman Jerome Powell made it clear that no adjustments are
planned in the near future either.

The rise in government bond yields is supported by the dollar, which
also rose in demand as a defensive asset after some European countries
suspended vaccinations with AstraZeneca due to side effects. The DXY
dollar index rose 0.5% for the week.

The dollar remains stable and shows no signs of sustained weakening
after the last Fed meeting. Mild funding conditions together with
accelerating vaccinations in the United States, the adoption of the next
package of fiscal assistance and the prospect of lifting quarantine
restrictions and opening the economy, are increasing [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) interest
in US assets and, ultimately, in the dollar. It is likely to continue to
strengthen next week if the situation on the US government bond market
does not change.

Next week, financial market participants will pay attention to the
publication of important macro statistics from the UK, Germany, the
Eurozone, the United States, as well as the results of the meetings of
the central banks of China and Switzerland.

 **Traders should pay attention to the publication of the following
macro indicators:**

 ***during the coming week, new events may be added to the [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) and
/ or some scheduled events may be canceled**

 ****GMT time**

###  **Monday, March 22**

###  **01:30 CNY The People's Bank of China interest rate decision**

Since May 2012, the People's Bank of China has been steadily cutting
interest rates in support of Chinese manufacturers. The last time the
bank lowered the rate in April 2020 (by 0.20% to 3.85% at the moment).

In 2020, amid international trade conflicts and a slowdown in the global
economy, the world's largest central banks took the path of easing their
monetary policies in order to support national economies and increase
the competitiveness of goods exported from these countries.

The People's Bank of China is also in line with this process. The
depreciation of the yuan has become especially relevant in the last 2
years, when the confrontation between the two most powerful economies in
the world began. One of the measures to mitigate the negative
consequences of increased duties on the import of Chinese goods into the
United States was the depreciation of the national currency of China.
This measure was intended, among other things, to maintain the same
volumes of imports of Chinese products to the United States, which would
cost American buyers less due to the difference in the rates of the
national currencies of the United States and China.

The coronavirus has become an additional strong negative factor.

Probably, at this meeting, the People's Bank of China will keep the
interest rate at the same level of 3.85%, although a rate cut is also
possible.

Nevertheless, if the People's Bank of China makes unexpected statements
or decisions, volatility may increase in the entire financial market.
Investors will also be interested in the bank's assessment of the
consequences of the coronavirus for the Chinese economy and its [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
in the near future in this regard.

###  **13:00 USD** Speech by the Fed Chairman Jerome Powell

Powell's comments could have an impact on both short-term and long-term
USD trading if he revisits the Fed's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). A more hawkish
stance on the Fed's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) is seen as positive and strengthens
the US dollar, while a more cautious stance is seen as negative for the
USD.

If he makes unexpected statements, the volatility in trading in the
financial markets may increase.

Following the results of the March 2021 meeting, the Fed kept the key
rate at 0.25% and confirmed its intention to achieve an average
inflation level of 2% with long-term inflation expectations also at an
average of 2%, signaling that the interest rate will remain at minimum
levels up to the end of 2023. At the subsequent press conference, the
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell made it clear that no adjustments are planned
in the near future either.

Nevertheless, financial market participants will carefully study his
speech in order to catch new signals regarding the further actions of
the Fed.

###  **Tuesday, March 23**

###  **07:00 GBP Report on the average wages of the British citizens for
the last 3 months. Unemployment rate**

On a monthly basis, the UK Office for National Statistics (ONS)
publishes a report on average wages covering the last 3 months, with and
without bonuses.

This report is a key short-term indicator of the dynamics of changes in
the level of wages of employees in the UK. Wages growth is positive for
the GBP, while a low value is negative. Forecast: March report suggests
that average wages with bonuses increased over the last reporting 3
months (November-January) by +4.0% (against +4.7%, +3.7%, +2.8% , +1.3%,
+0.1% in previous periods); without bonuses - increased by +4.3%
(against +4.1%, +3.6%, +2.8%, +1.9%, +0.9%, +0.2% in previous periods ).
Thus, the expected data is close to the average values ​​of the
indicators. They also point to the growing dynamics of the level of
wages, which is a positive factor for the pound as it contributes to the
growth of inflationary pressures. If the data turns out to be better
than forecast, the pound is likely to strengthen in the foreign exchange
market. Data worse than forecast will negatively affect the pound in the
short term.

Also at this time, data on unemployment in the UK are published. In the
3 months from November to January, unemployment is expected to be at
5.2% (against 5.1%, 5.0%, 4.9%, 4.8%, 4.5%, 4.3%, 3.9%, 3.9% in previous
periods). Since 2012, the UK unemployment rate has declined steadily
(from 8.0% in September 2012). This is a positive factor for the pound,
the rise in unemployment is a negative factor.

If the data from the UK labor market turn out to be worse than the
forecast and / or the previous value, then the pound will be under
pressure.

In any case, at the time of the publication of data from the British
labor market, an increase in volatility in the pound quotes and on the
London Stock Exchange is expected.

###  **11:50 GBP Speech by the head of the Bank of England Andrew
Bailey**

Participants in financial markets are expecting Andrew Bailey, who
became the head of the Bank of England on March 16, 2020, replacing Mark
Carney in this post, to clarify the situation regarding the future
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the central bank of Great Britain. Volatility during the
speech of the head of the Bank of England usually rises sharply in the
quotes of the pound and the London Stock Exchange FTSE index, if he
gives any hints of tightening or easing of the Bank of England's
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). Andrew Bailey will probably also touch on the state and
prospects of the British economy after Brexit and tough quarantine
restrictions due to the coronavirus. If Bailey does not touch upon the
issues of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), the reaction to his speech will be weak.

###  **16:00 USD The Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's speech in Congress**

The Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will speak to Congress on economy and
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). His comments could affect both short-term and long-term
USD trading if he again touches on the Fed monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). A more
hawkish stance on the Fed's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) is seen as positive and
strengthens the US dollar, while a more cautious stance is seen as
negative for the USD.

If he makes unexpected statements, the volatility in trading in the
financial markets may increase. Any hint by Powell about the need for an
even softer central bank [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) will cause the dollar to fall and
American stock markets to rise.

Financial market participants will carefully study his speech in order
to catch signals regarding the further actions of the Fed.

###  **23:50 JPY Bank of Japan Monetary Policy Committee Meeting**

At this meeting, the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Japan will
once again sum up the results of the bank's regular meeting last week,
analyze the economic situation in Japan and give indications on possible
future prospects for the Bank of Japan's financial [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).

If the tone of the minutes of the meeting indicates the firmness of the
intentions of the Bank of Japan regarding monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) in the
country, it will negatively affect the Japanese stock market and
strengthen the yen. Conversely, a soft rhetoric about the bank's
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) prospects will contribute to the weakening of the yen
and the growth of the Japanese stock market.

###  **Wednesday, March 24**

###  **07:00 GBP Consumer Price Index. Core Consumer Price Index**

Consumer Price Index (CPI) reflects the dynamics of retail prices for a
group of goods and services that make up the British consumer basket.
CPI is a key indicator of inflation. Its publication causes active
movement of the pound in the foreign exchange market, as well as the
London Stock Exchange FTSE100 index.

In the previous reporting month (January), the growth in consumer
inflation (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) amounted to +0.7%.

Forecast for February: +0.8% (annualized). This value indicates weak
inflationary pressures and is unlikely to provide significant support to
the pound. Indicator value below the forecast could provoke a weakening
of the pound, as low inflation will force the Bank of England to adhere
to a soft monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).

Core CPI is published by the Office for National Statistics and
determines the change in prices for a selected basket of goods and
services (excluding food and energy) for a given period. It is a key
indicator for assessing inflation and changes in purchasing preferences.
A positive result strengthens the GBP, a negative one weakens it.

In September, Core CPI (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) increased by +1.3%, in October
- by +1.5%, in December and January - by +1.4%. Probably, the
publication of the indicator will have a positive effect on the pound in
the short term, if its value is higher than the forecast and the
previous value. Forecast for February: +1.4% (annualized). The indicator
value below the forecast and previous values ​​may provoke a weakening
of the pound.

###  **08:30 EUR Germany Manufacturing PMI by Markit Economics
(preliminary release). Composite PMI  by Markit Economics(preliminary
release)**

Germany's Manufacturing PMI is an important indicator of the business
environment and the overall health of the German economy. This sector of
the economy forms a significant part of Germany's GDP. A result above 50
is seen as positive and strengthens the EUR, below 50 as negative for
the euro. Forecast for March (preliminary release): 60.9.

Previous monthly values: 60.7, 57.1, 58.3, 57.8, indicating that
business activity in this sector of the German economy is accelerating
after a slowdown in 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic. The growth of
the indicator above the previous value will support the euro (in the
short term). The data worse than the forecast will have a negative
impact on the euro.

Composite PMI is an important indicator of the business environment and
the overall health of the German economy. A result above 50 is seen as
positive and strengthens the EUR, one below 50 as negative for the euro.
Forecast for March (preliminary release): 51.8 against 51.1, 50.8, 52.0,
51.7 in previous months. The publication of this indicator with the
specified expected value is likely to support the euro in the short
term, despite the relative decline. The data worse than the forecast and
below the value of 50.0 will have a negative impact on the euro.

###  **09:00 EUR Eurozone Composite Manufacturing PMI by Markit
Economics (preliminary release)**

Eurozone's Manufacturing PMI is an important indicator of the health of
the entire European economy. A result above 50 is seen as positive and
strengthens the EUR, below 50 as negative for the euro. Forecast for
March (preliminary release): 49.1 against 48.8, 47.8, 49.1, 45.3 in
previous months, which is unlikely to have a positive impact on the
euro, also given the relative decline in the indicator. If the data
turns out to be worse than the forecast, the euro may drop sharply in
the short term.

###  **09:30 GBP UK Services PMI by Markit Economics (preliminary
release)**

The UK's Services PMI is an important indicator of the health of the UK
economy. The service sector employs most of the UK's working-age
population and accounts for approximately 78% of GDP. Financial services
continue to be the most important part of the services industry. If the
data turns out to be worse than the forecast and the previous value, the
pound is likely to drop sharply in the short term. The data is better
than the forecast and the previous value will have a positive impact on
the pound. At the same time, a result above 50 is seen as positive and
strengthens the GBP, below 50 - as negative for the GBP.

Previous values ​​of the indicator: 49.5 in February, 39.5 in January,
49.4 in December 2020, 47.6 in November, 51.4 in October, after falling
to 29.0 in May, 13.4 in April, 34.5 in March. Preliminary forecast for
March: 51.0

###  **12:30 USD Durable goods orders. Capital goods orders (ex defense
and aviation)**

This indicator reflects the value of orders received by manufacturers of
durable goods and capital goods (capital goods are durable commodities
used to produce durable goods and services) involving large investments.
Commodities produced in the defense and aviation sectors of the US
economy are not included in this indicator. A strong result strengthens
the USD. Previous values ​​of the indicator "durable goods orders":
+3.4% in January, +1.2% in December, +1.3% in November, +1.8% in
October, -18.3% in April, -16.7% in March, +2.0% in February, -0.2% in
January 2020.

Previous values ​​of the indicator "capital goods orders ex defense and
aviation": +0.5% in January, +1.5% in December, +1.2% in November, +1.9%
in September, +2.1% in August, -6.6% in April, -1.3% in March, -0.6% in
February, +0.9% in January 2020.

In theory, the relative growth of the indicator has a positive effect on
the dollar; the market reaction to its negative value may be negative
for the dollar in the short term. Data worse than the previous value
will also negatively affect the dollar quotes.

Forecast for February: +1.0% (durable goods orders), + 0.7% (capital
goods orders ex defense and aviation).

It seems that the growth of indicators continues after their recovery in
previous months from a strong drop in March and April 2020, which should
have a positive effect on the dollar quotes. Better-than-expected data
will also have a positive impact on the dollar.

###  **14:00 USD The Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's speech in Congress**

The Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will speak to Congress on economy and
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). His comments could affect both short-term and long-term
USD trading if he again touches on the Fed monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). A more
hawkish stance on the Fed's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) is seen as positive and
strengthens the US dollar, while a more cautious stance is seen as
negative for the USD.

If he makes unexpected statements, the volatility in trading in the
financial markets may increase. Any hint by Powell about the need for an
even softer central bank [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) will cause the dollar to fall and
American stock markets to rise.

Financial market participants will carefully study his speech in order
to catch signals regarding the further actions of the Fed.

###  **Thursday, March 25**

###  **00:00 EUR European Council meeting (all day)**

This meeting is attended by the heads of state and government of the
countries of the European Council. The purpose of this meeting is, among
other things, to discuss the current situation in the world and European
economy. The meeting will last all day. After its completion, an
official statement on the results of the meeting is published, which may
have an impact on the European and world financial markets.

###  **08:30 CHF SNB's decision on the interest rate. SNB's statement on
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)**

The current rate on deposits is in negative territory and amounts to
-0.75%. At the previous meeting in December, the rate remained
unchanged. The central bank of Switzerland has consistently advocated a
soft monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) in the country, and traditionally considers the
rate of the national currency "overvalued". Recently, the franc has
largely lost its status as a safe-haven currency, and the threat of
intervention, of course, is holding back the franc from excessive
growth. According to the SNB leaders, the franc is “still very
overvalued” and intervention in the foreign exchange market remains “an
important means of maintaining the low attractiveness of investments in
francs and easing upward pressure on the currency”.

Traders will also scrutinize the SNB's statement in order to pick up
signals regarding further monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) plans. Tough rhetoric of the
statement will strengthen the franc. A soft tone and the intention to
continue the extra soft monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the SNB will negatively
affect the franc. High volatility is expected in the foreign exchange
market and, above all, in the franc if the SNB management makes
unexpected statements.

###  **09:30 GBP Speech by the head of the Bank of England Andrew
Bailey**

Participants in financial markets are expecting Andrew Bailey, who
became the head of the Bank of England on March 16, 2020, replacing Mark
Carney in this post, to clarify the situation regarding the future
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the central bank of Great Britain. Volatility during the
speech of the head of the Bank of England usually rises sharply in the
quotes of the pound and the London Stock Exchange FTSE index, if he
gives any hints of tightening or easing of the Bank of England's
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). Andrew Bailey will probably also touch on the state and
prospects of the British economy after Brexit and tough quarantine
restrictions due to the coronavirus. If Bailey does not touch upon the
issues of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), the reaction to his speech will be weak.

###  **12:30 USD US Annual GDP for 4th Quarter (final estimate)**

GDP data is one of the key indicators (along with labor market and
inflation data) for the Fed in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of its monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). A strong
result strengthens the US dollar; a weak GDP report negatively affects
the US dollar. In the previous 3rd quarter, GDP grew by +33.4% after
falling by -31.4% in the 2nd quarter and by -5.0% in the 1st quarter of
2020.

If the data indicate another decline in GDP in the 4th quarter, the
dollar will be under pressure. The positive data on GDP will support the
dollar and the American stock indices, although they are already mostly
priced in. The preliminary forecast for the 4th quarter of 2020 was
+4.0% (+4.1% second estimate).

###  **Friday, March 26**

###  **00:00 EUR European Council meeting (all day)**

This meeting is attended by the heads of state and government of the
countries of the European Council. The purpose of this meeting is, among
other things, to discuss the current situation in the world and European
economy. The meeting will last all day. After its completion, an
official statement on the results of the meeting is published, which may
have an impact on the European and world financial markets.
