Dollar doesn’t take words. Forecast as of 30.07.2021Dmitri Demidenko

The [EURUSD][1] is rising amid an increase in Germany's inflation and a
weak reading of the US GDP. Investors interpreted Jerome Powell’s speech
as a dovish statement. Have not they been mistaken? Let us discuss the
Forex outlook and make up a trading plan.

## Weekly US dollar fundamental forecast

People hear what they want to hear. They took for truth Jerome Powell's
statement that it was still a long time before raising the federal funds
rate but did not believe the words of the Fed chairman about the
adaptation of the US economy to the pandemic. After the release of
disappointing data on US GDP for the second quarter, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s continue
to speculate how the Delta will slow down the gross domestic product,
which, coupled with the positive reports in the euro area, encouraged
the [EURUSD][1] bulls to go ahead.

A few days ago, some traders wanted to sell the dollar, as the US
economy peaked and was likely to slow down so that the United States
will lose its exclusivity. GDP growth of 6.5%, and not 8.4% expected by
Bloomberg experts, in April-June showed that the peak is still far away.
Optimists focus on a decrease in stocks due to a lack of supply and
expect that growth in this component will push the gross domestic
product up to 8% in July-September. Pessimists worry about the Delta. In
their opinion, the spread of the new strain of COVID-19 will lead to new
lockdowns and reduce consumer spending.

For me personally, the glass is half full. I believe that the delta
variant of the coronavirus was given to humanity to speed up vaccination
- the only way to defeat the pandemic. In Britain, where 57% of adults
are fully vaccinated, the number of new coronavirus cases is already
beginning to decline. Despite the complete opening of the economy. I
believe that the epidemiological situation in the United States will
soon begin to improve. Jerome Powell is right, so why not believe his
other ideas?

The problem is that some of Powell’s ideas can be misinterpreted. For
example, the phrase that several strong reports on the US employment are
required to start the QE tapering has discouraged some [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s from
believing that the end of the asset purchases will be announced in
Jackson Hole in August. However, the announcement of the withdrawal of
monetary stimulus and the start of a reduction in the scale of asset
purchases are different things. In addition, one cannot compare the
previous experience, when 14 months passed between the end of the QE and
the rate hike, and the current conditions. The US economy plunged into
the deepest recession (GDP in the first and second quarters of 2020 fell
by a record average annual 19.2%) and came out of it very quickly. So
why shouldn’t the Fed hurry up?

The [EURUSD][1] rallied amid an increase in Germany's inflation to 3.1%
in July, the highest since 2008. Trade unions demand wage increases.
German central bank chief Jens Weidmann has said his advisers
anticipated inflation nearing 5% in Germany later this year.

Unfortunately, the CPI surged amid temporary factors, and the Bundesbank
chief alone cannot influence the ECB monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). A strong reading
of the euro-area inflation and GDP could send the [EURUSD][1] even
higher, but the uptrend will start exhausting soon. Isn’t it a reason
the sell the fact? Unless the euro consolidates above $1.188, it will be
relevant to sell because of the buyers’ weakness.
