USDJPY: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 30.07.2021 –
06.08.2021Alex Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 110.59 with a target of 108.20 – 107.09.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
110.59 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 113.50 –
115.00.

 **Analysis:** Daily TM: apparently, a descending correction of larger
degree finished forming as wave B, and wave С started developing, with
the first wave (1) of С forming as part of it.

The third wave of smaller degree 3 of (1) continues developing on the H4
time frame, with wave i of 3 formed and a downside correction developing
as wave ii of 3 inside. Apparently, wave (а) of ii and wave (b) of ii
formed on the H1 time frame, and wave (c) of ii is developing at the
moment. If the presumption is correct, the pair will continue to drop to
the levels of 108.20 – 107.09. The level of 110.59 is critical in this
scenario as a breakout will enable the pair to continue growing to the
levels of 113.50 – 115.00.
