Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 30.07.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

Yesterday, the gold short-term downtrend reversed up.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

Yesterday, the oil price reached the Gold Zone 73.19 - 72.92 within a
short-term uptrend. It was not possible to break out the zone, so now
there is a correction. As part of the correction, the traders reached
the Micro-zone 72.70 - 72.63.

Today watch the Micro-zone test and look for a buy pattern with a target
at yesterday's high.

If the support level of 72.30 is broken out, there will be a false
breakout sell pattern. It is possible to enter oil sales within this
pattern, while the target will be known later.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

Open buy positions according to the pattern in 72.70 - 72.30.
TakeProfit: 73.33. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

Yesterday, the gold short-term downtrend reversed up. The Intermediary
Zone 1817 - 1815 was broken out. Now the Target Zone 1842 - 1837 serves
as the target for purchases.

Now a gold price correction can be seen. As part of the correction, the
traders are testing the Micro-zone 1827 - 1826. Look for purchases in
the beforementioned MZ according to the pattern with the target at
yesterday's high.

If the Micro-zone is broken out today, the price will most likely reach
the Additional Zone 1821 - 1820. The AZ is another support to look for
purchases in.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

  1. Buy according to the pattern in Micro-zone 1827 - 1826. TakeProfit: 1832. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. Buy according to the pattern in Additional Zone 1821 - 1820. TakeProfit: 1832. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

The short-term euro trend reversed up. Yesterday, the US trading session
closed the price beyond the Intermediary Zone 1.1851 - 1.1842. Now the
target for purchases is the Target Zone 1.1948 - 1.1930.

Now the price is correcting and approaching the Micro-zone 1.1872 -
1.1870. If the zone is held, the local high will be updated. If the zone
is broken out, the price will move towards the Additional Zone 1.1850 -
1.1846.

The Additional Zone is another strong trend's support. If it is tested,
look for purchases according to the pattern with a target at the day's
high.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

  1. Buy according to the pattern in Micro-zone 1.1872 - 1.1870. TakeProfit: 1.1893. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. Buy according to the pattern in Additional Zone 1.1850 - 1.1846. TakeProfit: 1.1893. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.
