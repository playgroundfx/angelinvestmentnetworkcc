Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 30.07.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

The cryptocurrency market should continue rising.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

The Bitcoin price continues rising. There is unfolding the final motive
wave (Y) of the global double zigzag. Wave (Y) is a standard zigzag.
With impulse A and correction B completed inside. There is developing
the bullish wave C as a five-wave impulse [1]-[2]-[3]-[4]-[5]. Wave [5]
will soon conclude the C impulse. The Bitcoin price is likely to reach
level 41905.00, where wave (Y) will be 161.8% of wave (W).

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 39940.00, TP 41905.00

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

The XRPUSD is forming a horizontal corrective pattern, a flat A-B-C.
More than a week ago, the market completed the bearish wave B a triple
zigzag. The market turned up and started rising in the impulse wave C.
There is developing the final leg of the C wave, wave [5] as an ending
diagonal. The ending diagonal is about to end soon. The Ripple price
should go up to a level of 0.783. Next, the market is expected to start
declining in a new bear trend.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] **** today:

Buy 0.749, TP 0.783

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

The ETHUSD market is rising in the final leg of the bullish correction.
In the impulse upwave [C], there have completed the first four legs.
Correction (4) must have completed as a contracting triangle. The
Ethereum price should be rising in the final wave (5) to a level of
2591.00. At this level, wave [C] will be 123.6% of wave [A]. One could
consider long trades with a target at level 2591.00.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Buy 2398.64, TP 2591.00
