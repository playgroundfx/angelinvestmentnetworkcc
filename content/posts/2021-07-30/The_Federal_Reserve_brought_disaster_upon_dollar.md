The Federal Reserve brought disaster upon dollar

## FED found the strength not to search for any strength

One needs to be insane to think the world is OK. Financial markets faced
chaos in the summer. Gold fell amid soaring inflation and the bond
yields' collapse to all-time lows but started growing once interest
rates on the US debt went up. The pound consolidated even if Great
Britain was planning to amend the Brexit deal unilaterally and the Bank
of England's rhetoric looked dovish. The US dollar weakened, although
the FED opened its doors to normalizing monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). The [S&P
500][1] didn't care about the epidemiological state getting worse or
downbeat GDP stats. Is that OK?

> \- Do you know what "intrigue" means? I'll tell you tomorrow.

Jerome Powell talked much but didn't get to the essence at the FOMC
press conference in July. Investors didn't hear what they wanted to
hear. The economy made some progress, but it's not enough. Mortgage-
backed securities purchases may be tapered faster than Treasury
purchases, but that's not for sure. Delta is evil, but should it be
feared? That vague wording suggests the FED found the strength not to
search for strength any longer. The Central bank voiced its intent to
act at a snail's pace in normalizing monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), and the US dollar
went on sale immediately.

Hearing a crow cawing may be a bad omen for the dollar. Powell looks
like a crow "cawing" about a hole in the labor market and saying that
several positive employment reports are required to taper QE and a rate
hike is not on the FED's agenda. Also, he didn't hint at withdrawing
monetary stimuli. Can the Central bank return to patience that was a
funeral strategy for the greenback in the first half of the year?

The FOMC's meetings in June and July let me think that the FED has too
much power over financial markets. It's often seen as a messiah during
recessions, but an aggressive tightening of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) may provoke
a slump. Not only does the FED move economic cycles, but also it can
afford to break and restore trends. The [EURUSD][2] bulls were destroyed
in June against the background of rumors about a federal funds rate
hike. The same can happen to bears in the absence of clear indications
of a QE taper.

> \- Darling, you can't even imagine where I was tonight!

> \- I can. But I'd like to listen to your version first.

Everyone has their answer to the questions like “Why did the greenback
show its worst weekly performance since May after the FOMC meeting?” or
“Should the [EURUSD][2] sellers start to panic, or is that a mere
correction?” It seems one can't figure that out without alcohol:

> \- I need a genie from the bottle!

> \- There's only gin.

>

> \- I'll have some!
