XAUUSD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 30.07.2021 –
06.08.2021Alex Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions from corrections above the
level of 1788.35 with a target of 1958.14 – 2016.10.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
1788.35 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of
1673.40 – 1568.91.

 **Analysis:** an ascending third wave of larger degree (3) formed and a
descending correction developed as wave (4) on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame. The
fifth wave (5) appears to be developing on the H4 time frame, with the
first wave of smaller degree 1 of (5) formed and a downward correction
completed as wave 2 of (5) inside. The third wave 3 of (5) started
developing on the H1 time frame, with a corrective wave ii of 3
completed and wave iii of 3 forming inside. If the presumption is
correct, the pair will continue to rise to the levels of 1958.14 –
2016.10. The level of 1788.35 is critical in this scenario as a breakout
will enable the pair to continue declining to the levels of 1673.40 –
1568.91.
