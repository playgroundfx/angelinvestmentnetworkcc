USDCAD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 30.07.2021 –
06.08.2021Alex Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 1.2811 with a target of 1.2000 – 1.1850.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
1.2811 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 1.3413 –
1.3722.

 **Analysis:** wave (С) of 4 of larger degree continues developing on
the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame, with the third wave 3 of (C) formed inside. An
ascending correction finished developing as the fourth wave 4 of (C),
and the fifth wave 5 of (C) is forming now on the H4 time frame.
Apparently, the first counter-trend wave of smaller degree i of 5 is
developing on the H1 time frame, with wave (iii) of i developing inside.
If the presumption is correct, the pair will continue to drop to the
levels of 1.2000 – 1.1850. The level of 1.2811 is critical in this
scenario as a breakout will enable the pair to continue rising to the
levels of 1.3413 – 1.3722.
