All roads lead the euro to RomeDmitri Demidenko

## EUR/USD will rally up if the EU adopts the offer made by Emmanuel
Macron and Angela Merkel

The ECB is willing to save Italy, but will the EU agree? According to
the Bank of France Governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau, using the
capital key, when the QE size is associated with the size of the
economy, is not necessary for the emergency program. Germany, whose GDP
should drop by 6.5% in 2020, is likely to receive the most benefits,
while Italy’s, Spain’s and Greece’s GDPs will lose more than 9%. The
European central bank is willing to not only boost the QE volume but
also break its own rules, which is a positive factor for the euro.
However, little depends on Frankfurt, the key decisions will be taken in
Brussels.

The [EUR/USD][1] rise to 1.1 amid the [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) about the French-German plan
for a €500-billion recovery fund is natural. European governments
support unity. However, not all member-states support this idea.
Austria, Sweden, Denmark, and the Netherlands stated their opposition to
grants, calling for a loans-based approach instead. Only 32% of the
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s polled by ExanteData believe that the EU will fully accept the
proposal of Paris and Berlin. 38.2% of respondents suggest that the plan
should be corrected. This is a bear factor for the euro, allowing
selling the [EUR/USD][1] on the rise.

The major problem is in Italy, whose economy stopped expanding after the
introduction of the single European currency, and the US stocks started
to outperform the euro-area peers.

Unless Rome receives enough support, it makes no sense to be an EU
member. The risks of the euro-area breakup will press the [EUR/USD][1]
down. However, the French-German plan could still be adopted at the EU
summit, which will allow the euro to rise.

In the meanwhile, the euro-dollar trend mostly depends on the US stock
indexes, as [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are weighing which is a more important factor, the
reopening of the global economies or the escalation of the US-China
trade war. According to the Netherlands Bureau of Economic Policy,
international trade in March contracted by 1.4 M-o-M and 4.3 Y-o-Y,
which is the worst drop since 2009. This is a negative factor for the
export-led euro-area economy. However, the indicator should rebound in
the May-June period, also because of the active fulfillment of China’s
obligations to the US.

US-China trade relations seem to have aggravated. However, Donald Trump
wants to be re-elected as the US President, so he needs to put pressure
on China. Besides, the escalation of the situation forces China to
stimulate its economy to increase the purchases of US goods. Since the
pandemic started, PBoC has injected about 5.9 trillion yuan ($ 827.6
billion) in the economy, and it is willing to continue in the same way.
This suggests a V-shaped rebound of China’s economy, which in the medium
term will support the [EUR/USD][1], currently stuck in the trading range
of 1.077-1.099.
