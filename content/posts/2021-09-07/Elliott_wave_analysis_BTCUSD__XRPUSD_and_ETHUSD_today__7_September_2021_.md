Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 07.09.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

The XRPUSD, like the BTCUSD, has finished forming the upward wave.
Therefore, the prices should start falling soon.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

The BTCUSD market must have completed the corrective wave [B] as a
simple zigzag (A)-(B)-(C). If the presumption is correct, the market
should turn down and start declining. The Bitcoin price should go down
to a level of 48270.00 and lower. One could enter sell trades in the
current situation with a target at the above-indicated level.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Sell 52653.50, TP 48270.00

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

The XRPUSD market must have completed the long-term linking wave (X) as
a simple zigzag A-B-C. Therefore, the market should turn down and start
declining in a new bearish trend. The Ripple price should go down to a
level of 1.232, marked by the bearish correction (4). One could enter
sell trades with a profit target at the previous low.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] **** today:

Sell 1.381, TP 1.232

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

There continues forming the corrective wave B, namely its final sub-wave
[C]. Wave [C] is a simple five-wave impulse, whose first four legs have
completed, and the final wave (5) is still unfolding. Wave 5 should
conclude wave (5). The Ethereum price should go up to 4100.00. Once the
level is reached, the market should turn down and start declining. One
could enter purchases in the current situation.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Buy 3934.53, TP 4100.00
