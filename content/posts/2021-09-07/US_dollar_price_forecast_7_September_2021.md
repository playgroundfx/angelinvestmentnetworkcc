Dollar is drifting. Forecast as of 07.09.2021Dmitri Demidenko

The hawkish tone of the ECB officials supported the [EURUSD][1] rally to
five-week highs. What if the ECB doesn’t introduce any changes to its
current [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). Let us discuss the Forex outlook and make up a trading
plan.

## Weekly US dollar fundamental forecast

Life rarely meets expectations. The spread of the Delta across the
planet, even in regions where vaccination rates are high, lockdowns and
closed borders are slowing down the global economy. This is clearly seen
from China’s PMI and US employment. Markets expect central banks to
abandon the plans for monetary normalization and maintain monetary
stimulus, which will support global stock indexes and [EURUSD][1] bulls.

Remarkably, the euro-area economy now looks rather stable despite a
general downturn in the global economy. The Institute of International
Finance has lowered its global GDP forecast from 6.2% to 5.7%. Faster
economic growth in the euro area than in the USA in the second quarter,
positive PMI changes, and inflation rise by 3% are the result of
successful vaccinations and a better epidemiological situation than in
America and Asia.

As the euro area shows signs of recovery, the ECB should start
normalizing its monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). However, COVID-19 is very insidious,
and a hasty abandonment of monetary stimulus in an environment when the
pandemic is not yeе over could nullify the unprecedented work of the
central bank.

Markets now expect that Christine Lagarde and her colleagues will decide
in September to cut monthly asset purchases under the PEPP. However, if
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s misinterpret this decision of the central bank and consider it
to be a general reduction in monetary stimulus, this could lead to a
tightening of financial conditions and a slowdown in the euro-area GDP.
The last time the ECB, through the mouth of Mario Draghi, spoke about
tapering the QE was in 2016. At that time, it resulted in sharp growth
of Germany’s bond yields. The European Central Bank will hardly repeat
the same mistake.

It should be noted that there is still no announcement about the
decrease in monthly asset purchases under the PEPP. Bloomberg believes
that the easiest solution would be to keep the pace of bond purchases at
higher levels. If the ECB does not make adjustments to the current
mechanism for the implementation of the program, it will discourage the
[EURUSD][1] bulls.

The best [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) rise of the European stock indexes over the past six
weeks proves that markets expect the European Central Bank to maintain
its ultra-easy monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). After all, the PEPP monthly pace is not
as important as inflation trends. The ECB considers the spike in prices
to be temporary and intends to keep interest rates at current levels
until at least 2024. Therefore, the potential for the euro rally looks
limited.

### Weekly[ EURUSD][1] trading plan

The [EURUSD][1] could go up on the expectations of hawkish signals from
the Governing Council on September 9. However, the risks of the euro
sell-off based on facts are quite high. If the price breaks out the
resistance at 1.1895, it will continue growing.
