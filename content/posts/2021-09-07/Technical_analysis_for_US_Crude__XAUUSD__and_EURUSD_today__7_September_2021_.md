Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 07.09.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

Since yesterday, gold has been in a correction with a target in the
Intermediary Zone 1813 - 1811.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

Oil is trading in correction with the target at the trend key support
67.87 - 67.62. Now the price is testing the zone of good sell prices
69.51 - 69.39. It is reasonable to enter short trades in this zone.

The purchases according to the trend require a test of a strong support
level, for example, the zone of 67.87 - 67.17. After that, wait for the
buyers' reaction and enter a long trade according to the pattern with
the target at level 70.33.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

Sell from the zone of 69.51 - 68.75. TakeProfit: 67.75. StopLoss: 69.65.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

The short-term gold trend is up. The main growth target is the Gold Zone
1845 - 1843.

Since yesterday, gold has been in a correction with a target in the
Intermediary Zone 1813 - 1811. Holding this zone by buyers will lead to
the price rise and the update of last week's local high. In this case,
enter long gold trades.

The breakout of the Intermediary Zone will lead to the reversal of the
short-term uptrend. In this case, consider a short trade with a target
in the lower Target Zone 1792 - 1788.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

Buy according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 1813 - 1811.
TakeProfit: 1833. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

The euro is trading in a short-term uptrend with the target in the Gold
Zone 1.1936 - 1.1928. Now the price chart shows the development of the
corrective pattern. Within its framework, the traders tested the
Additional Zone 1.1865 - 1.1860. Buyers still hold the zone.

Today, the search for euro purchases according to the pattern with the
target in the Gold Zone is a matter of primary importance. If the
pattern is not provided, but the Additional Zone is broken out, then
look for an opportunity to sell the euro in correction with the target
in the Intermediary Zone 1.1821 - 1.1812.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

Buy according to the pattern in Additional Zone 1.1865 - 1.1860.
TakeProfit: Gold Zone 1.1936 - 1.1928. StopLoss: according to the
pattern rules.
