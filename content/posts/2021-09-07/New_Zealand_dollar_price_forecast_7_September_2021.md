Kiwi is a favorite with the public. Forecast as of 07.09.2021Dmitri
Demidenko

The improvement of the epidemiological situation in New Zealand, hopes
for the RBNZ's rate hike, and the high global appetite for risk make
[NZDUSD][1] bulls feel confident. Let us discuss the Forex outlook and
make up a trading plan.

## Monthly New Zealand dollar fundamental forecast

The market has different attitudes towards the mistakes of central
banks. As I expected, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s' hatred of the New Zealand dollar over
the Reserve Bank's fear of nationwide isolation [did not last long][2].
Kiwi remains a traders' favorite. Over the past six months, it has
strengthened against the USD by 2.3% and serves as the best G10
performer in this period.

The main drivers of [NZDUSD][1] growth include improved global risk
appetite, hopes for Chinese stimulus, and expectations of continued
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) normalization by RBNZ. Adrian Orr and his colleagues
were the first among the G10 central banks to taper QE in July and were
ready to raise the cash rate in August if not for COVID-19. Then the NZD
collapsed due to the reluctance of the RBNZ to do what [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s
expected of it. But then the Kiwi quickly regained lost ground.
Currently, the money markets predict an increase in the main interest
rate by 100 bps until the end of 2022.

### Dynamics of market expectations for cash rate

The yield on New Zealand bonds will grow along with the cash rate. Local
10-year bond rates are above 2% and are at their highest level since
April 2019. They are higher than their counterparts from the 24 largest
economies tracked by Bloomberg. It is not surprising that the Kiwi is
rapidly strengthening against the background of the growth of the US and
world stock indices. The wide yield differential and high reliability of
New Zealand bonds create excellent opportunities for carry traders.

The Kiwi is supported by the decision of Jacinda Ardern's government to
lift the national lockdown all over the country, except Auckland. As a
result, there are growing risks of divergence in economic growth with
neighboring Australia, whose GDP risks turn negative in the third
quarter.

Good [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) from China is worth noting. China's exports grew by 25.6% to
$294.3 billion in August, and imports by 33.1% to $236 billion. Both
indicators are record-breaking in absolute [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/). A trade surplus of
$58.3 billion and expectations of reducing contributions to the legal
reserve make the GDP acceleration very possible. According to Bloomberg
experts, the PBC is ready to pour about 1 trillion yuan into the system.

The effective pandemic suppression [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) inspires hope for a bright
future in China amid widespread uncertainty over the further Delta
spread. This strengthens its proxy currencies, such as the Australian
and New Zealand dollars.

RBNZ's monetary restriction, high global risk appetite and support from
China made it possible to implement the [EURNZD][3] and [AUDNZD][4]
selling strategies outlined [in the previous article][2]. The
[NZDUSD][1] has exceeded the upper border of the expected consolidation
range by 0.71. Only the [S&P 500][5] correction will prevent the pair
from continuing the rally. Hold [EURZND][6] and [AUDNZD][4] shorts and
use [NZDUSD][1] and [NZDJPY][7] corrections to enter long trades in the
direction of 0.721 and 79.5.
