Pfizer Stock Forecast: Is It a Great Stock to Buy?Jana Kane

Investors have been eyeing Pfizer stocks ever since the company began
shipments and became part of a mass vaccination program. Some puzzled by
the market’s treatment of Pfizer, having expected the prices to
skyrocket. So far, the shares have had a slow-and-steady status rather
than spectacular surges.

 ****

Still, the company’s future outlook seems bright, making [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s
wonder whether they should jump in right now. Will Pfizer’s stock go up?
Find out in this Pfizer stock price forecast!

The article covers the following subjects:

## About the Pfizer Stock

[Pfizer][1] (NASDAQ: PFE) traces its origins to 1849, but it finally became a publicly-traded company in 1942, nearly a century after its founding. The $5.9 million IPO was one of the largest of that year, with shares valued at a price of $24.75 apiece. On the very first day, the company reached the market cap of $12.4 million.

At the time of its incorporation, the chemical enterprise was valued at
$2 million. Today, the market cap has reached $215 billion, and it’s
still one of the largest manufacturers and distributors of
pharmaceuticals, agricultural and animal health products, pharmaceutical
chemicals, nutritional products, and items for personal, household, and
industrial use.

Currently, Pfizer is a component of the following U.S. stock market
indices:

## Main Factors That Drive Pfizer (PFE) in 2021 & In the Future

There is no clean equation that tells us exactly where the [Pfizer stock
price][1] will go, or any stock price, for that matter. That said, we
can pinpoint a few things about the forces that move PFE stock.

### Everything Vaccine-Related

An 11-figure revenue outlook in 2021 is not far-fetched. Although, it
depends on how quickly Pfizer can produce and distribute its COVID-19
vaccine. Plus, there are many indirect factors that may change the
Pfizer stock forecast:

  * Long-term safety profile of COVID-19 vaccines;

  * Duration of immunity;

  * Effectiveness compared to the Moderna and other vaccines, especially if Pfizer’s vaccine works better;

  * Risk of variants that can evade vaccine-induced immunity;

  * Untested COVID-19 vaccine regimens.

### Research and Development Potential

Pfizer keeps its pipeline of experimental first products and early
commercial-stage drugs full. This is a crucial fundamental factor in the
PFE stock prediction. In the last few months alone, the company made
many exciting announcements, including:

  * Extension of review of Abrocitinib’s new application for the treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis;

  * Application for Tanezumab as a treatment of osteoarthritis pain;

  * Initiation of phase 2 study for a Lyme disease vaccine candidate;

  * Pivotal Phase 2 MagnetisMM-3 trial of BCMA-CD3 bispecific antibody Elranatamab (PF-06863135) in multiple myeloma.

All of these combined make a compelling argument in favor of projected
growth.

### Cash Flows

After spinning off assets from its Upjohn unit into Viatris, Pfizer
expects cash flow from its slimmed-down operations to reach at least $10
billion in 2021. This will give them more chances to invest in potential
new sources of revenue.

Pfizer’s stockholders automatically receive distributed shares of the
Viatris stock, but Pfizer is doing great even without big cash
injections from Viatris. More importantly, the sales from its COVID-19
vaccine are not the only important contributor to the total revenue. So,
the situation with cash flow and earnings seems solid.

### Manufacturing Capacity

Pfizer’s vaccine is limited by the manufacturing capacity of the company
and its partner, BioNTech SE. The company stated that it would scale up
production in response to strong demand and increased revenue for the
quarter. BioNTech added new manufacturing lines at the Lonza facility,
located in Visp, Switzerland, and greenlighted other changes to the
manufacturing processes.

### Pfizer Index Inclusion

There is a phenomenon called the index inclusion effect. It implies that
after being included in a stock index, the increased demand for the
stock from index [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s may increase its value. So, if other indices
like the ones we mentioned earlier add the company to the list, it will
be reflected in the Pfizer share price prediction. ****

## Pfizer Price in 2021: Forecasts From Experts

Below are five projections on the Pfizer stock future from prominent
analysts and firms.

### Geoffrey Porges, SVB Leerink

 ****

[Geoffrey Porges][2] recently shared his Pfizer stock price forecast for
2021, where he maintained his “Hold” rating and lowered his price target
from $44 to $40. This was a reaction to the [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) that the experimental
pain medication developed by Pfizer and Eli Lilly may be less likely to
gain approval.

### Elmar Kraus, DZ Bank

[Elmar Kraus][3] sees growth potential as he raised his rating from
“Buy” to “Strong Buy,” setting the PFE price target at $41. This is a
projected 6.30% upside from the current price at the time of writing.

### Vamil Divan, Mizuho

The PFE stock forecast from [Vamil Divan][4] has both good and bad price
projections. On the one hand, he maintains his “Strong Buy” rating, and
on the other hand, he lowered the price target from $44 to $42.

### The Goldman Sachs Group

[Pfizer][1] has been assigned a $41.00 price objective by stock analysts
at The Goldman Sachs Group. And the firm currently doesn’t see much
growth, having a “Neutral” rating on the biopharmaceutical company’s
stock.

### Berenberg Bank

The mention in our analyst recommendations is Berenberg Bank. They
reiterated a “Neutral” rating while also issuing a $38.00 price target
on shares of Pfizer in their research note.

## Pfizer Stock Technical Analysis

First, we'll do a technical analysis of [Pfizer][5] stock's biggest time
frame to identify global trends and key levels that can impact price
movements.

The chart above displays a stable bullish trend developing since 2009.
The ascending price movement has got faster in the past months. Intense
trading activities and a breakout of the previous high at 46 US dollars
confirm[ Pfizer][6] shares' bullish potential.

We'll lay the Fibonacci grid over the upward movement pattern to single
out development stages of the trend's lifespan and powerful
support/resistance levels. Five key zones can be singled out on the
chart:

The price crossed the limit of the peak value area in August and
retraced down. The current Pfizer to USD price peak is very likely a
reversal point. To find that out for sure, let's check other technical
analysis instruments.

### Pfizer Stock Forecast For Next Three Months

We'll make a short-term forecast for Pfizer stock's price on the weekly
chart as it provides more precise signals.



[The RSI][7] indicates record high overboughtness. So, the pullback from
the peak value area and the sellers' relatively high activity suggest
that a trend reversal is the likeliest scenario in the long term.

However, the PFE price's proximity to consolidation zones will strongly
affect the ticker's behavior in the coming months. The price has come
close to the support level of 46.50 USD.

The 2019 fractal might repeat itself. The stock price will likely pull
back from the current levels in the nearest three months and try to
retest the all-time high of 51.80 USD.

### Long-Term PFE Shares Technical Analysis for 2021/2022

Let's examine the price [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) and draw expected Pfizer price
projections for the next twelve months based on [[Bollinger Bands](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/bollinger-bands.html)][8].

The most realistic forecast suggests a fall in [Pfizer stock][9] value
in 2021-2022. Support levels will make it gradual and smooth.

Apparently, the first downward wave has already started and will unfold
up to spring 2022. The projected fall will have reached the level of 43
USD then. That level marks the intense growth area's lower limit and the
resistance formed by one of the previous local maximums.

The Pfizer stock might then pull back for a while in the following
months. The price will fluctuate between 43 and 48 USD. The sellers'
potential and ambitions will likely push the price down again as early
as summer 2022.

Because trading volumes indicate a trend's strength as well as support
breakouts do, it's very important to trace them as a bearish trend
develops.

Check out the table below for Pfizer stock's expected trading ranges.
I've marked the lowest and the highest projected values for each month
of 2021-2022.

#### Pfizer Long-Term trading plan

Here's a long-term trading plan for Pfizer shares based on the above
analysis, including stop values and optimum price targets.



The fall appears to have already started, which allows us to open short
trades in [Pfizer to USD][5]. The first short trade should be opened on
a pullback at around 51 USD - the blue line on the chart.

Stop Loss should be placed above all-time highs and the key level of 52
USD - the red line on the chart above. Then, wait for a bearish trend to
develop.

The final target of the scenario is 39 US dollars. The price movement
won't be linear, as the chart suggests. Additional short trades can be
opened on pullbacks upon crossing each of the areas marked. Remember to
move your stop orders, fix profits, and avoid risks per trade exceeding
1% of your deposit.

up? [Gov Capital][12] shared their Pfizer stock price forecast for 2022.
According to this source, the stock will lay low at the beginning of
next year and make a big leap in mid-spring. ****

The drastic surge in PFE stocks’ value in the spring may be caused by
the company’s increased capacity ([3 billion doses of the vaccine][13])
and authorization for vaccination of younger kids ([6 months to 11
years][14]).

## Pfizer Price Forecast for 2023

[Gov Capital’s][12] PFE forecast for 2023 is full of surprises — future
prices might be falling in the first few months and an explosive
increase (possibly caused by an expected spike in sales).

Again, the source expects a sudden rise in PFE’s value. This may be
explained by the EU buying more doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech in 2023 —
[1.8 billion][15].

## What Will Pfizer Stock Be Worth in 2025-2030?

This Pfizer stock forecast for 2025 is provided by [Digital Coin
Price][16]. Contrasting it to the Gov Capital’s prediction for 2023, the
values provided for 2025 are nothing but a natural progression (as long
as all developments go according to plan).

Kind reminder: Pfizer stock projections for 2030 is only an estimated
assumption. With forecasts so far into the future, accuracy is limited.
Even the Pfizer stock 5-year forecast should be taken with a degree of
skepticism. That’s why conservative [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s may have a preference for
indices like S&P 500 rather than try to pick the stock performance
winners.

## Pfizer’s Stock Price Changes Over Time

Having checked the Pfizer predictions, let’s take a look back to gain
some perspective. Below is the timeline of some of the most notable
events (in recent price [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/)):

  * October 2016: A public health emergency Zika — stock price at $28.

  * 2017: Lackluster financial results — $31-$34.

  * February 2018: Millions paid to resolve co-pay allegations — close to $32.

  * November 2018: Announcement of plans to raise the list prices of 10% of its portfolio — $43

  * July-August 2019: Poor decision to spin off its generic drug business — from $40 to $32. 

  * March 2020: WHO declares COVID-19 a Pandemic — the stock quote fell to $27.

 ****

  * May-June 2020: Safety study of four different COVID-19 vaccine variations — from $36 down to $30 and back to $36.

  * July 2020: Two vaccine candidates winning regulatory approval from the FDA — a rise to $37.5.

  * November: Pfizer and BioNTech announce the vaccine’s success.

  * December of the same year: The FDA issued the first emergency use authorization (EUA) for the vaccine — $42.5.

  * February 2021: Unfulfilled earnings expectations — $33. 

  * March-April 2021: Operation Warp Speed and plans to increase output — $38.

## Is Pfizer a Good Long-Term Investment?

Pfizer doesn’t draw long-term [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s by quick pops and drops but
rather solid stock performance over the years versus months or even
days. Overall, the Pfizer share forecast confirms that the company is a
top pick for those seeking profit from a pharma giant.

This Pfizer stock outlook by [Coin Price Forecast][18] is adamant that
Pfizer’s stock is a good one.
