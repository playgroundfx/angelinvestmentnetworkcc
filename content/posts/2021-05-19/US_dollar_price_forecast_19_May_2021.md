Dollar and the sense of guilt. Forecast as of 19.05.2021Dmitri Demidenko

The easing of the risks of the euro-area break-up after the German
Federal Constitutional Court verdict, acceleration of the vaccination
campaign in the EU, and the Fed’s ultra-easy monetary allowed the
[EURUSD][1] to return above 1.22. What’s next? Let us discuss the Forex
outlook and make up a trading plan.

## Weekly US dollar fundamental forecast

It is better to regret what you did than what you did not do. The Fed's
unwillingness to respond to the inflation surge may be nothing more than
a feeling of guilt for the actions of its predecessors. After the
2008-2009 recession, the central bank tapered QE and raised rates,
fearing a surge in consumer prices. In fact, it did not happen, the
Federal Reserve turned out to be wrong, and it doesn’t want to repeat
the previous mistakes. The Fed is willing to maintain its ultra-easy
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) for a long time, which will support the [EURUSD][1]
growth.

However, the ECB officials started using the phrase that there was no
risk of a durable return of inflation in the euro area. For example,
François Villeroy de Galhau noted that the ECB’s monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) should
remain very accommodative. The EURUSD is rising not because of the
divergence in the central banks’ monetary policies. So, what’s the
reason?

At first sight, the US economy is growing faster than the euro-area one.
The US GDP was up by 1.6% Q-o-Q in the first quarter, the euro area slid
into the double-dip recession. Even a significant upgrade of the euro-
area growth outlook of 4.3% in 2021 presented by the European Commission
is much below the US growth expectations of 6% and higher. 82.8% of the
population have been inoculated in the US, while in the EU, the share of
the vaccinated population is 44.8%. Fortunately, markets are rising on
the expectations. In fact, the euro-area economy is more likely to
exceed the forecasts than the US growth to meet the expectations of the
IMF.

High-frequency data indicators, including an increase in the number of
job adverts, growth in travel to entertainment and leisure venues, and
rising holiday bookings, suggest that the euro-area economy should
rebound from its double-dip recession in the second quarter. Oxford
Economics expects the euro-area GDP to grow 1.5% in April-June. The
reason is the vaccination acceleration in the EU, which increases the
chance of the economy’s reopening, followed by a booming growth.

Another reason for the EURUSD bulls’ optimism has become Germany
Constitutional Court“s verdict that the European Central Bank's
quantitative easing program was legal and didn’t suggest direct funding
of governments, as insisted by the claimants. Karlsruhe is losing its
role of lender of last resort for German euro critics. Therefore, the
easing of the risks of the QE end because of the court verdict
encourages the euro buyers.

### Weekly [EURUSD][1] trading plan

What benefits does the US dollar have? Is it magic number 4? since 1957,
the [S&P 500][2] has fallen 8 times out of 9, 3 months after US
inflation exceeded 4%. The exception was 2005 when the CPI quickly
returned below this value. What will be this time? The controversial
reports on US employment and inflation have been evidence that inflation
is growing because of the supply disruptions rather than the higher
demand. The temporary factor allows the |Fed to maintain its current
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), supporting the [EURUSD][1] rally. The euro has reached
the first of the [earlier indicated targets][3] at $1.22. Will it reach
the second one at $ 1.226?
