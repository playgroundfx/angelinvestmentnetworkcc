Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 19.05.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

Yesterday, the euro priority buy pattern yielded profits. The price has
reached the Target Zone 1.2245 - 1.2227.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

As a part of the correction down in the short-term oil uptrend, the
support zone 65.66 - 65.53 was broken out. Then the price reached the
trend border at 64.34 - 64.07. After testing the trend border, oil
prices rebounded up and tested the resistance 65.57 - 65.44. The price
didn't break out the resistance, as a result, a price drop can now be
seen.

Today, the support level 64.89 was broken out. It can be assumed that
the price will continue to decline further and will update yesterday's
low. In this case, the likelihood of a trend reversal down will
increase.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

Sell from the level of 64.89. TakeProfit: 63.32. StopLoss: 65.55.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

Gold is trading in a range between the resistance level of 1873.00 and
the support level of 1864.00. A breakout of the resistance at 1873 will
lead to the test of the Gold Zone 1878-1876. Price consolidation above
the Gold Zone will allow considering purchases up to the Target Zone 2
1903-1898.

In case of breaking out the support at 1864, the price will go into a
deep correction with the target in the Intermediary Zone 1852 - 1850.
This idea can be used to sell the precious metal.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

  1. Buy when level 1873 is broken out. TakeProfit: 1888. StopLoss: 1865.00

  2. Sell when level 1864 is broken out. TakeProfit: Intermediary Zone 1852 - 1850. StopLoss: 1869.5.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

Yesterday, the euro priority buy pattern yielded profits. The price has
reached the Target Zone 1.2245 - 1.2227. Further growth will depend on
the traders' ability to consolidate the price above the resistance
level.

Since the Target Zone is not broken out, expect the euro price
correction with the first target in the Additional Zone 1.2201 - 1.2196.
It is possible to consider new purchases according to the pattern in
this zone.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

  1. Buy according to the pattern in Additional Zone 1.2201 - 1.2196. TakeProfit: 1.2239. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. Buy according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 1.2157 - 1.2148. TakeProfit: 1.2239. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.
