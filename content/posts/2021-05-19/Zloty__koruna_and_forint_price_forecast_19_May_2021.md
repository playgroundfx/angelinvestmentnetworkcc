Eastern Europe is a delicate matter. USDPLN, USDCZK and USDHUF forecast
as of 19.05.2021Dmitri Demidenko

While commodity currencies are betting on the commodity market's super-
cycle, then the Eastern European monetary units are relying on the
eurozone's strength, which serves as its major trading partner, and on
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) tightening. Let us discuss the Forex outlook and make up
a trading plan for [USDPLN][1], [USDCZK][2], and [USDHUF][3]

## Fundamental Polish zloty, Сzech koruna, and Hungarian forint forecast
for six months

When at the end of March I recommended holding Eastern European
currencies in investment portfolios, many traders were probably
surprised. During the first quarter, the Polish zloty, the Czech koruna,
and the Hungarian forint lost approximately 4-5% of their value due to
slow vaccinations in the EU, another wave of COVID-19, and unrealized
hopes for a strong recovery of the eurozone economy. Nevertheless,
already at the end of the second decade of May, the situation turned
upside down.

If you intend to hold a particular currency in your portfolio for a long
time, you need to rely on the strength of its major trading partner's
economy. This was the case in the 2020 situation with New Zealand and
Australian dollars due to China's effective fight against the pandemic.
This is the case with the loonie in the first half of 2021 due to the US
GDP's rapid return to the trend. The same thing is beginning to happen
with the Eastern European currencies, the main trading partner of which
is the eurozone. Acceleration of vaccination in the EU and positive
economic surprises in the currency block allowed the zloty to almost
completely compensate for the losses incurred in the first quarter, and
allowed the forint and the koruna to enter the green zone at the
beginning of 2021.

Nordea Markets notes that Eastern European currencies tend to strengthen
with a time lag after the eurozone statistics start to please the eye.

The recovering eurozone economy is not the only reason for the return of
[USDPLN][1], [USDCZK][2], and [USDHUF][3] downtrend. With inflation
accelerating, not all countries are ready to follow the Fed's path,
which intends to allow the US economy to overheat. Polish consumer
prices soared to 4.3% and are likely to exceed the central bank's
forecast of 3.1% at the end of 2021, with a target of 1.5-3.5%. Because
of this, there are fierce discussions in Warsaw about whether to support
the recovery or return to the traditional values ​​of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).
In Prague and Budapest, the choice has already been made.

Hungary's leadership in the EU vaccination process (76.4% of the
population have been inoculated compared to 44.8% on average in the EU)
and the acceleration of inflation to 5.1% allowed the local central bank
to talk about raising rates over the summer. The Czech central bank
officials, in turn, said that a tightening of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) could
happen as early as June. The derivatives market is looking forward to
this process, which allows the koruna and other Eastern European
currencies to strengthen confidently.

The benefits of [USDPLN][1], [USDCZK][2], and [USDHUF][3] bears do not
end there. Poland, Czech Republic, and Hungary are members of the EU
Recovery and Resilience Facility. For example, Poland is one of the main
beneficiaries of this program that can count on €58 billion in grants
and loans.

In my opinion, [USDPLN][1], [USDCZK][2], and [USDHUF][3] downtrends are
likely to continue in the direction of 3.46-3.52, 19.57-19.75, and
277-280. I recommend selling the pairs.
