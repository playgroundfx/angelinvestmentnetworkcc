Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 19.05.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

All the three cryptocurrency pairs covered in the article must have
completed upward sub-waves earlier than expected. Therefore, the prices
should be declining.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

Bitcoin has started falling in price, so the corrective wave [2] must
have completed as a simple zigzag A-B-C. Therefore, there should be
unfolding the inceptive part of the impulse down wave [3]. The price can
go down to a level of below 33900.00. One could enter short positions in
the current situation with the downside target at the indicated level.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Sell 39525.50, TP 33900.00

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

The XRPUSD market continues forming the horizontal corrective wave [B]
as a contracting triangle. This triangle is composed of five sub-waves
(A)-(B)-(C)-(D)-(E). The corrective wave (D) must have completed as a
double zigzag W-X-Y, as earlier expected. Wave W here is a triple
zigzag. The first two legs of the down wave (E) have also completed.
Therefore, the market should be declining in impulse wave C to a level
of 1.312. At this level, wave (E) will be 76.4% of (D), according to the
Fibonacci retracement.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] today:

Sell 1.433, TP 1.312

## Elliott wave Ethereum analysis

The ETHUSD market, like the BTCUSD, has completed the corrective wave
[2] earlier than expected. There is developing the initial part of the
bear impulse [3]. There have completed the first two sub-waves of the
impulse, waves 1 and 2. Therefore, the Ethereum price should continue
falling to a level below 2170.00. This is the low marked by corrective
wave 4. One could enter a short position at the current levels with the
downside target at level 2170.00.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Sell 2955.95, TP 2170.00
