Economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the week 01.11.2021 – 07.11.2021Jana Kane

##  **Review of the main events of the Forex economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the
next trading week (01.11.2021 – 07.11.2021)**

The dollar rose last week, but ended October in negative territory.
Investors are assessing the prospects for the Fed's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
after US central bank leaders are expected to begin winding down
stimulus policies at a November 2-3 meeting, starting by cutting back on
purchases in the bond market.

The Fed has maintained its key rate at 0.25% since March 2020,
purchasing at least $120 billion in government bonds and mortgage bonds
every month since June 2020.

Nevertheless, the opinions of market participants regarding the short-
term prospects of the dollar after the Fed meeting were divided. About
half of them believe that the Fed's decision to start curtailing
stimulus will not greatly affect the dynamics of the dollar. At the same
time, unexpected and more radical statements on the part of the Fed are
possible.

If tough signals follow, it will lead to the closure of a significant
part of the short positions in the dollar and to its further
strengthening. The tougher the statements made by the Fed leaders at the
end of the November meeting, the more the dollar will strengthen.

At the same time, optimism prevails on global stock exchanges,
associated with expectations of a further recovery in the global
economy, both against the backdrop of the unfolding vaccination against
coronavirus in Europe and North America, and the overly soft [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of
the world's largest central banks.

Next week, financial market participants will also pay attention to the
publication of important macro statistics on Germany, the US, New
Zealand, Australia, the Eurozone, Canada, as well as the results of
meetings (in addition to the Fed) of the central banks of Australia and
the UK.

Traders should also take into account that many European countries
switch to winter saving time this coming Sunday. In the United States,
this transition will take place a week later.

 ***during the coming week, new events may be added to the [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) and
/ or some scheduled events may be canceled**

 ****GMT time**

###  **Monday, November 1**

###  **07:00 EUR Retail Sales in Germany**

Retail sales is the main indicator of consumer spending in Germany
showing changes in retail sales. A high result strengthens the euro, and
vice versa, a low result weakens it. Forecast: +0.6% (+1.8% in annual
[terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) in September against +1.1% (+0.4% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) in August,
-5.1% (-0.3% in annualized) in July, +4.2% (+6.2% yoy) in June, +4.2%
(-2.4% yoy) in May, -2.0% (+4.4% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) in April, +7.7% (+11%
in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) in March, +1.2% (-9.0% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) in February,
-4.5% ( -8.7% YoY) in January.

The data indicate the instability of the recovery of this sector of the
German economy caused by the lockdowns due to the coronavirus pandemic.
Better-than-expected data is likely to have a positive effect on the
euro, but in the short term.

###  **14:00** **USD US Manufacturing** **PMI (from ISM)**

Published by the Institute for Supply Management (ISM), the US
Manufacturing PMI is an important indicator of the health of the US
economy as a whole. A result above 50 is seen as positive and
strengthens the USD, one below 50 as negative for the US dollar.
Forecast: 60.4 in October (against 61.1 in September, 59.9 in August,
59.5 in July, 60.6 in June, 61.2 in May, 60.7 in April, 64.7 in March ,
60.8 in February 58.7 in January, 60.7 in December). The index is above
the 50 level and has a relatively high value, which is likely to support
the dollar, despite the relative slight decline in the indicator. The
data above the value of 50 indicates an acceleration of activity, which
has a positive effect on the quotes of the national currency. If the
indicator falls below the forecast and, especially, below the value of
50, the dollar may sharply weaken in the short term.

###  **23:50 JPY Bank of Japan Monetary Policy Committee Meeting**

At this meeting, the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Japan will
once again sum up the results of the last week's regular meeting of the
Bank, analyze the economic situation in Japan and give indications on
possible future prospects for the Bank of Japan's financial [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).

If the tone of the minutes of the meeting indicates the firmness of
intentions of the Bank of Japan regarding monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) in the
country, it will negatively affect the Japanese stock market and
strengthen the yen. Conversely, a soft rhetoric about the bank's
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) prospects will contribute to the weakening of the yen
and the growth of the Japanese stock market.

###  **Tuesday, November 2**

###  **03:30 AUD RBA's decision on interest rate. RBA's accompanying
statement**

In March 2020, the RBA made 2 rate cuts, bringing it to the level of
0.25%, and launched a quantitative easing program. At the same time, for
the 3-year government bonds of Australia, the target level of yield is
set at 0.25%. The RBA has launched a lending program for the banking
system in the amount of at least A$ 90 billion.

In early November 2020, the RB of Australia lowered its key rate again,
bringing it and the target 3-year bond yield to 0.10% from 0.25% and
announced a quantitative easing program in the amount of A$ 100 billion
to support the incipient economic recovery. country.

The main negative factors for the Australian economy are weak wages
growth, a weak labor market and a slowdown in growth. Annual inflation
has remained below the RBA's target range of 2% -3% for four years.

Unemployment in the country has remained above the 5% level for many
years, unwilling to decline. Now the Australian economy is experiencing
difficulties due to the coronavirus pandemic, which has hit the tourism
and transport sectors.

It is expected that at this meeting the Central Bank of Australia will
leave the rate at the current level of 0.1%, although unexpected
decisions are not ruled out.

In an accompanying statement, the leaders of the RBA will explain the
reasons for the decision on the rate. If the RBA signals the possibility
of further easing of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) in the near future, the risks of a
fall in the Australian dollar will increase.

###  **21:45 NZD Employment rate. Unemployment rate (data for the 3rd
quarter)**

The employment rate reflects the quarterly change in the number of
employed New Zealand citizens. The growth of the indicator has a
positive impact on consumer spending, which stimulates economic growth.
A high reading is positive for the NZD, while a low reading is negative.
Outlook: In the 3rd quarter, the number of employed citizens of New
Zealand increased, and the employment rate increased by +0.4% (against
an increase of +1.0% in the 2nd quarter, +0.6% in the 1st quarter of
2021 of the year).

Also at the same time, the Bureau of Statistics of New Zealand publishes
a report on the unemployment rate - an indicator that estimates the
ratio of the unemployed population to the total number of able-bodied
citizens. The growth of the indicator indicates the weakness of the
labor market, which leads to a weakening of the national economy. The
decrease in the indicator is a positive factor for the NZD. Forecast:
unemployment in New Zealand in the 3rd quarter was at the level of 3.9%
(against 4.0% in the 2nd quarter, 4.7% in the 1st quarter of 2021).

If other indicators of the NZ Bureau of Statistics report deteriorate,
it is likely to negatively affect the NZD. Data worse than the forecast
will have an even stronger negative impact on the NZD.

###  **Wednesday, November 3**

###  **10:15 EUR Speech by head of the ECB Christine Lagarde**

During the speech of the head of the ECB, the volatility of trading
increases not only in the euro and European stock indices, but
throughout the financial market, especially if Christine Lagarde touches
on the topic of the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the Central Bank. Any hints at
curtailing the QE program in the Eurozone will cause the euro to rise.
Lagarde's soft tone and the propensity to continue the extra soft
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the ECB will negatively affect the euro.

Speeches of the head of the ECB after the bank's meetings have a
particularly strong influence on the market. In previous periods, the
speech of the head of the ECB in similar situations could cause a change
in the euro rate by more than 3%. If Christine Lagarde does not touch
upon the topic of the ECB's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), the reaction to her speech
will be weak.

###  **12:15 USD ADP National Employment Report**

Typically, the ADP's private sector employment report has a strong
impact on the market and dollar quotes. An increase in the value of this
indicator has a positive effect on the dollar. US private sector
employment is expected to grow by +400,000 in October (up from 568,000
in September, 374,000 in August, 330,000 in July, 692,000 in June,
978,000 in May, 742,000 in April, 517,000 in March, 117,000 in February,
174,000 in January, a drop of -123,000 in December). The relative growth
of the indicator may have a positive effect on the dollar quotes, while
the relative decline in the indicator is negative. Therefore, the market
reaction may be negative, and the dollar may decline if the data turns
out to be worse than forecast.

Millions of Americans have previously been laid off due to the
coronavirus pandemic and related quarantine measures. The bulk of
layoffs were concentrated in tourism and retail. Other important sectors
of the economy were also affected. ADP previously reported that the most
significant drop in employment was recently noted in the construction
and financial services sectors.

Although the ADP report does not directly correlate with the official US
Department of Labor data on the labor market, which will be released on
Friday, the ADP report is often a harbinger of it, having a noticeable
impact on the market.

###  **14:00 USD US Services** **PMI (from ISM)**

This indicator assesses the state of the services sector in the US
economy. These services sectors (as opposed to the manufacturing sector)
have practically no impact on the country's GDP.

In July this indicator came out with a value of 64.1, and in September -
61.9. A result above 50 is seen as positive for the USD. Outlook for
October: 62.0, which is likely to have a positive overall effect on the
USD. However, a deeper relative decline in the index could negatively
affect the dollar in the short term.

###  **18:00 USD The Fed's decision on the interest rate. The Fed's
comments on monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)**

In March 2020, the Fed lowered the interest rate to 0.25% (from 1.75% in
February), and also announced the allocation of $700 billion for the
purchase of US government bonds and mortgage-backed securities.
Subsequently, the Fed has repeatedly announced additional measures to
support the American economy and inject cheap liquidity into the
financial system. Usually, with the easing of the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), the
national currency becomes cheaper and its quotations go down.

In 2020, the dollar declined as [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s withdrew funds from defensive
assets, buying more risky and profitable assets of the stock market,
which continued to grow despite the threat of a second wave of the
coronavirus epidemic and the associated economic slowdown. The role of
the dollar as a defensive asset was also declining. However, in 2021,
the dollar is strengthening, which is associated with an increase in the
yield of US government bonds, and the Fed has not yet responded to this
in any way.

The rate is widely expected to remain at 0.25% at this meeting.
Nevertheless, during the period of publication of the decision on the
rate, volatility may sharply grow throughout the financial market,
primarily in the American stock market and in the dollar quotes,
especially if the decision on the rate differs from the forecast or
unexpected statements are received from the Fed leaders.

Powell's comments may affect both short-term and long-term USD trading.
A more hawkish stance on the Fed's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) is seen as positive
and strengthens the US dollar, while a more cautious stance is seen as
negative for the USD. Investors are eager to hear Powell's views on the
Fed's future plans for this year.

###  **18:30 USD FOMC press conference**

The press conference of the US Federal Open Market Committee lasts about
an hour. In the first part, the ruling is read, followed by a series of
questions and answers that can increase market volatility. Any hints by
Powell about the possibility of a change in the current monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
will cause an increase in volatility in the dollar quotes and in the
American stock market.

###  **Thursday, November 4**

###  **00:30 AUD Balance of trade**

The indicator (balance of trade) assesses the ratio of the volume of
Australia's exports and imports. Growth in exports from Australia leads
to an increase in the trade surplus, which has a positive impact on the
AUD. Previous value A$ 15.077 Billion (August), A$ 12.117 Billion
(July), A$ 9.681 Billion (May), A$ 8.028 Billion (April), A$ 5.574
Billion (March), AU$ 7.529 Billion dollars (for February). A decrease in
the trade surplus may negatively affect the Australian dollar.
Conversely, the growing trade surplus is a positive factor for the AUD.
Forecast for September: A$ 12.175 billion.

###  **12:00 GBP Bank of England's interest rate decision. Minutes of
the meeting of the Bank of England. Planned volume of asset purchases by
the Bank of England. Monetary Policy Report**

In March (11 March and 19 March) 2020, during its extraordinary
meetings, the Bank of England cut its interest rate twice, bringing it
to the level of 0.1%, and announced its intention to purchase UK
government bonds in the amount of 200 billion British pounds, trying to
counteract economic damage from the coronavirus pandemic. The central
bank announced an increase in its bond portfolio to £645bn, then to
£745bn and to £895bn from £445bn at the time. "The current situation is
completely unprecedented," said Governor of the Bank of England Andrew
Bailey during a press conference after an emergency meeting on March 19.
Bailey said he expects a sharp economic contraction due to the
coronavirus, and the Bank of England is ready to take further stimulus
measures if necessary. “No, we are not done yet,” he said. Based on
these statements by Andrew Bailey, it is fair to expect further actions
from the Bank of England towards easing its monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). It is
possible that at this meeting the Bank of England will again undertake
them, increasing the volume of purchases of bonds or lowering the
interest rate. Although, most market participants believe that the Bank
of England will refrain from these actions, especially since some
economists believe that the Bank of England will soon be ready to start
curtailing its stimulating [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), while very positive macro data is
coming from the UK.

Also at this time, the minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of
the Bank of England are published with the distribution of votes "for"
and "against" raising / lowering the interest rate. The main risks for
the UK after Brexit are associated with expectations of a slowdown in
the country's economic growth, as well as with a large current account
deficit in the UK balance of payments.

The intrigue about the further actions of the Bank of England remains.
And in trading the pound and futures on the FTSE100 index, a lot of
trading opportunities are provided during the period of publication of
the bank's decision on rates.

Also at the same time, the Bank of England's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) report will
be published, containing an assessment of the economic outlook and
inflation. At this time, the volatility in the pound quotes may rise
sharply. Apart from GDP, one of the main benchmarks for the Bank of
England regarding the prospects for monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) in the UK is the
inflation rate. If the tone of the report is soft, the British stock
market will receive support and the pound will decline. Conversely, the
report's tough rhetoric on curbing inflation, implying an increase in
interest rates in the UK, will strengthen the pound.

###  **12:30 GBP Speech by head of the Bank of England Andrew Bailey**

Financial market participants expect Andrew Bailey to clarify the
situation regarding the future [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the UK central bank. Volatility
during the speech of the head of the Bank of England usually rises
sharply in the quotes of the pound and the London Stock Exchange FTSE
index, if he gives any hints of tightening or easing of the Bank of
England's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). Probably, Andrew Bailey will also give
explanations regarding the decision made by the Bank of England on the
interest rate and will touch upon the state and prospects of the British
economy after Brexit and the partial lifting of quarantine restrictions
due to the coronavirus. If Bailey does not touch upon the issues of
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), the reaction to his speech will be weak.

###  **13:00 EUR Speech by head of the ECB Christine Lagarde**

During the speech of the head of the ECB, the volatility of trading
increases not only in the euro and European stock indices, but
throughout the financial market, especially if Christine Lagarde touches
on the topic of the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the Central Bank. Any hints at
curtailing the QE program in the Eurozone will cause the euro to rise.
Lagarde's soft tone and the propensity to continue the extra soft
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the ECB will negatively affect the euro.

Speeches of the head of the ECB after the bank's meetings have a
particularly strong influence on the market. In previous periods, the
speech of the head of the ECB in similar situations could cause a change
in the euro rate by more than 3%. If Christine Lagarde does not touch
upon the topic of the ECB's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), the reaction to her speech
will be weak.

###  **Friday, November 5**

###  **00:30 AUD** RBA's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) report

The monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) report provides an overview of economic and
financial conditions and an assessment of risks to financial stability
and sustainable economic growth. The report is a kind of guideline for
defining the RBA's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) plans. A tougher stance on the RBA's
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) is seen as positive and strengthens the Australian
dollar, while a more cautious stance is seen as negative for the AUD.

###  **10:00** **EUR Retail Sales in the Eurozone**

Retail sales is a major consumer spending indicator that shows the
change in retail sales. A high result strengthens the euro, and vice
versa, a low result weakens it. September forecast: +0.2% (+1.5% yoy)
against +0.3% (+0% yoy) in August, -2.3% (+3.1% yoy) ) in July, +1.5%
(+5.0% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) in June, +4.6% (+9.0% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) in May,
-3.1% and +23.9 % (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) in March, +3.0% and -2.9% (in annual
[terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) in February, -5.9% and -6.4% (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) in January. The
data suggests that, despite the rise in indices, retail sales have not
yet reached pre-coronavirus levels after a sharp drop in March-April
2020, when strict quarantine measures were in force in Europe.
Nevertheless, better-than-expected data is likely to have a positive
effect on the euro.

###  **12:30 USD Average hourly wages. Non-Farm Payrolls. Unemployment
rate**

These are the most important indicators of the state of the labor market
in the United States in October. Forecast: +0.4% (against +0.6% in
September and August, +0.4% in July, +0.3% in June, +0.5% in May, +0.7%
in April ) / +0.425 million (against +0.194 million in September, +0.235
million in August, +0.943 million in July, +0.850 million in June,
+0.559 million in May, +0.266 million in April, +0.916 million in March,
+0.379 in February, +0.049 million in January, -0.140 million in
December, +0.245 million in November, +0.638 million in October, +1.763
million in July and -20.687 million in April 2020) / 4.7% (against 4.8%
in September, 5.2% in August, 5.4% in July, 5.9% in June, 5.8% in May,
6.1% in April, 6.0% in March, 6, 2% in February, 6.3% in January, 6.7%
in December and November, 6.9% in October, 13.3% in May and 14.7% in
April 2020), respectively.

In general, the indicators can be desxcribed as encouraging. The data
speaks of continued improvement in the US labor market after plummeting
in the first half of 2020. Prior to the coronavirus, the US labor market
remained strong, signaling the stability of the American economy and
supporting dollar quotes.

It is often difficult to predict the market reaction to the publication
of indicators, because many indicators for previous periods are subject
to revision. Now it will be even more difficult to do this, because the
economic situation in the United States and many other large economies
remains controversial due to the coronavirus. In any case, when data
from the US labor market is published, a surge in volatility is expected
in trading not only in USD, but throughout the entire financial market.
Cautious [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s might choose to stay out of the market during this
time frame.

###  **12:30 CAD Unemployment rate in Canada**

Statistics Canada is to publish data on the country's labor market for
October. Unemployment has risen in Canada in recent months, including
amid massive business closures due to coronavirus and layoffs.
Unemployment rose from the usual 5.6% - 5.7% to 7.8% in March and
already up to 13.7% in May 2020. If unemployment continues to rise, the
Canadian dollar will decline. If the data is better than the previous
value, the Canadian dollar will strengthen. A decrease in the
unemployment rate is a positive factor for the CAD, an increase in
unemployment is a negative factor. In September, unemployment was at the
level of 6.9% (against 6.9% in August, 7.5% in July, 7.8% in June, 8.2%
in May, 8.1% in April, 7.5 % in March, 8.2% in February, 9.4% in
January, 8.8% in December, 8.6% in November).
