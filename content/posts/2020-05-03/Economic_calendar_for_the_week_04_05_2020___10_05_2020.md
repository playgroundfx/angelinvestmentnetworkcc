Economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the week 04.05.2020 – 10.05.2020Jana Kane

##  **Overview of the main events of the Forex economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the
next trading week 04.05.2020 to 10.05.2020**

 **Trading on key Forex [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/): we are expecting the publication of
important macro statistics from the US, New Zealand, Germany, Canada, as
well as the results of the meeting of the central banks of the UK and
Australia, at which the interest rates will be decided.**

The two largest world central banks, the Fed and the ECB, have decided
so far not to change their monetary policies. The Fed officials decided
that they already did a lot to support American companies and businesses
in the context of the coronavirus. At the same time, they assured that
the central bank “intends to use the full range of tools to support the
US economy in this difficult time”, and the Fed is already preparing a
second series of assistance programs that provide direct lending to
companies, state governments, and local authorities. "The sooner we take
the virus under control, the sooner trust will return to people and they
will resume their economic activity," said the Fed Chairman Jerome
Powell at the subsequent press conference.

Last Thursday, the ECB refrained from making changes to its monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), focusing on the banking system and adopting two changes to
stimulate lending to companies and households.

The ECB has lowered the interest rate on the already existing program of
preferential lending for banks known as the _targeted longer-term
refinancing operations_ (TLTRO). Beginning in June, banks lending to
customers will be able to take loans from the ECB at a rate of -1%, i.e.
the ECB will pay banks at 1% to take loans from it. Lenders who do not
meet the criteria of the program will be able to take loans at a rate of
-0.5%. The ECB has also introduced a new longer-term refinancing
emergency program (PELTRO) designed to ease tensions in the short-term
lending markets.

However, the ECB's decisions did not help European stocks, which fell
sharply at the end of last week, while the euro strengthened. Shares of
European banks were among the most affected assets: Euro Stoxx Banks
Index fell on Thursday by 5.3%.

The Bank of Japan also did not begin to make changes to its [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) last
week. However, the reaction of Asian and global financial markets to
this decision was almost invisible.

At the same time, the global economy and businesses continue to suffer
enormous costs due to limitations associated with coronavirus.

Thus, the ISM Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) for the US manufacturing
sector in April fell to 41.5, the lowest level since April 2009, against
49.1 in March. This was announced on Friday by the Institute for Supply
Management (ISM).

The PMI for the US manufacturing sector, calculated by IHS Markit, also
showed a record drop in April, as manufacturers paused and canceled
orders amid the spread of coronavirus. The manufacturing PMI fell to
36.1 in April from 48.5 in March, reaching an 11-year low.

Some governments have already expressed their intention to partially
lift restrictions on movement. Meanwhile, medical experts are warning
about the possibility of a second wave of the epidemic if the
restrictions are lifted prematurely.

Next week, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s will be focused on the central banks of Australia
and the United Kingdom and their decisions on interest rates, as well as
a monthly report from the US labor market.

It is also worth noting that next Friday, May 8, Europe will celebrate
Victory Day in the 2nd World War. European banks will be closed. Trading
volumes will be low on this day.

 _ **Traders should pay attention to the following significant
macroeconomic data expected next week:**_

 *** during the coming week new events may be added to the [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) and
scheduled events may be canceled**

 ****** **GMT time**

###  **Monday, May 4**

No important macro statistics planned to be released.

###  **Tuesday, May 5**

###  **04:30 AUD Interest rate decision. RBA's accompanying statement**

In March, the RBA made 2 rate cuts, bringing it to its current level of
0.25%, and launched a quantitative easing program. At the same time,
3-year Australian government bonds have a target yield of 0.25%. The RBA
will begin a program of lending to the banking system in the amount of
at least 90 billion Australian dollars and will buy bonds worth 5
billion Australian dollars.

Negative forecasts of economists suggest that the Australian economy
will decline by 6% in 2020, which will be the sharpest annual decline in
GDP since the great depression of the 1920s. The unemployment rate is
likely to rise to about 8.5%.

Some economists have started talking about Australia entering its first
recession in almost 30 years, which could turn into depression.

“We live in extraordinary and difficult times,” said the head of the
central bank Philip Lowe. In his opinion, “further stimulation is
needed.” He said this at a press conference on March 19, where the RBA
lowered the interest rate during its unscheduled meeting.

Philip Lowe has repeatedly stated that the central bank is ready to
lower the rate again if necessary, although the likelihood of
introducing negative rates, in his opinion, is "extremely small."

The main negative factors for the Australian economy are weak wages
growth, a weak labor market and a slowdown in growth. For almost four
years ago the annual inflation has remained below the target range of
2-3% set by the RBA.

Unemployment in the country remains above 5% for many years, reluctant
to decline. Now the coronavirus pandemic has been added to the above-
mentioned negative factors, which has already hurt Australia's economy
and transport in the tourism industry. The RBA also expresses concern
that unemployment could rise to the level of 8%, or even 10%.

In this regard, we cannot eliminate the fact that on Tuesday May 5, the
RBA may again cut the rate, although most economists believe that the
bank will leave the key rate unchanged at this level at 0.25%, while
expressing concern over global economic outlook with the ongoing
epidemic of coronavirus.

In the accompanying statement, the RBA leaders will explain the reasons
for the decision on the rate. If the RBA signals a possibility of
further easing of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), then a further fall in the Australian
dollar will become inevitable.

###  **14:00 USD Employment Index (from ISM) in the services sector. PMI
(from ISM) in the US economy services sector** ****

This is an important indicator of economic conditions in the United
States published by the Institute of Supply Management (ISM) and
reflects business conditions in the US services sector, taking into
account the expectations of new orders, stocks, employment and supplies.
The ISM employment index in the services sector is considered an
important leading indicator when the US Department of Labor compiles an
employment report. A high value strengthens the USD, while a low value
weakens it. In April, this indicator came out with a value of 47.0. A
relative decline in the index may negatively affect the dollar in the
short term. A result below 50 is also seen as a negative factor for the
USD.

PMI index of business activity in the services sector assesses the state
of the services sector in the US economy. The services sector data
(unlike the manufacturing sector) have practically no effect on the
country's GDP. The growth of the indicator and the result above 50 are
considered as a positive factor for the USD. At the same time, a
relative decrease in the indicator or data worse than the forecast may
have a short-term negative impact on the dollar.

Forecast for May: 32.0 (versus 52.5 in March, 57.3 in February). A
relative decline in the index may negatively affect the dollar in the
short term. At the same time, results below 50 are considered as a
negative factor for the USD.

###  **22:45 NZD Employment rate. Unemployment rate (data for the 1st
quarter)**

Employment rates reflect a quarterly change in the number of employed
New Zealand citizens. The growth of the indicator has a positive effect
on consumer spending, which stimulates economic growth. A high value is
a positive factor for the NZD, and a low value is negative. Forecast: in
the 1st quarter, the number of employed New Zealand citizens decreased,
and the employment rate decreased by 0.1% (against the zero value in the
4th quarter).

Also at the same time, the Bureau of Statistics of New Zealand publishes
a report on the unemployment rate - an indicator that estimates the
ratio of the share of the unemployed to the total number of able-bodied
citizens. The growth rate indicates a weak labor market, which leads to
a weakening of the national economy. The decline is a positive factor
for the NZD. Forecast: unemployment in New Zealand in the 1st quarter
increased to 4.2% from 4.0% in the 4th quarter of 2019.

Other indicators from the New Zealand Bureau of Statistics report are
also expected to come out with a slight deterioration, which is likely
to negatively impact the NZD. Data worse than expected will also have a
negative impact on the NZD.

###  **Wednesday, May 6**

###  **12:15 USD ADP National Employment Report**

Change in the US employment (ADP National Employment Report) in April.
Usually, the publication of this indicator has a strong impact on the
market and dollar quotes. Although there is usually no direct
correlation with Non-Farm Payrolls, the ADP report is considered a
harbinger of the official report of the US Department of Labor on the
general state of the labor market in the country. The growth of the
indicator has a positive effect on the dollar. A decrease of 13.05
million the number of workers in the US private sector is expected
(after a decrease of -27,000 in March). A decrease in the result will
have a negative effect on the dollar.

###  **23:50 JPY Bank of Japan's Monetary Policy Committee Meeting**

As a result of the regular meeting held last week, the Bank of Japan
decided to keep the target level of 10-year bond yields of Japan at
about zero, and the short-term deposit rate at -0.1%. The bank promised
to maintain the current extra-soft monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). At the press
conference after the meeting of the Bank of Japan, its manager Haruhiko
Kuroda repeated his famous phrase that the central bank was ready to
ease monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) if necessary.

The committee will also analyze the economic situation in Japan and
provide guidance on possible future prospects for the Bank of Japan's
financial [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). If the tone of the protocol indicates the firm
intentions of the Bank of Japan regarding monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) in the
country, this will negatively affect the Japanese stock market and
strengthen the yen. Conversely, soft rhetoric regarding the prospects of
the bank's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) will contribute to the weakening of the yen
and the growth of the Japanese stock market.

###  **Thursday, May 7**

###  **06:00 GBP Bank of England's interest rate decision. Minutes of
the meeting of the Bank of England. Planned volume of asset purchases by
the Bank of England. Monetary Policy Report**

In March (March 11 and March 19), during its extraordinary meetings, the
Bank of England cut its interest rate twice, bringing it to 0.1%, and
announced its intention to acquire British government bonds in the
amount of 200 billion British pounds, trying to counter economic damage
from a coronavirus pandemic. The central bank's management announced the
expansion of its bond portfolio to 645 billion pounds from the current
volume of 445 billion pounds. “The current situation is completely
unprecedented,” said Andrew Bailey, new Governor of the Bank of England,
at a press conference after the emergency meeting on March 19. Bailey
said he expects a sharp contraction in the economy due to the
coronavirus, and the Bank of England is ready to take further stimulus
measures if necessary. "No, we are not finished," he said. Based on
these statements by Andrew Bailey, it is fair to expect further action
from the Bank of England towards easing its monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). It is
possible that at this meeting on May 7, the Bank of England will again
take them.

Also at this time the minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of
the Bank of England are published with the votes cast for and against
the increase / decrease in the interest rate. The main risks for the UK
after Brexit are associated with expectations of a slowdown in the
country's economic growth, as well as with a large current account
deficit in the UK balance of payments.

The Bank of England Asset Purchase Program, also called Quantitative
Easing, has remained unchanged since August 2016 at £435 billion per
month. In March, the Bank of England's bond purchase volume on the open
market was increased to a new level of 645 billion pounds.

Intrigue over further actions by the Bank of England continues. Both in
the pound and the FTSE100 index trade, a lot of trading opportunities
will be available during the publication of the bank's decision on
rates.

Also at the same time, the Bank of England's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) report will
be published containing an assessment of economic prospects. At this
time, the volatility in the pound quotes can increase sharply. One of
the main guidelines for the Bank of England regarding the prospects for
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) in the UK, in addition to GDP, is the level of
inflation. If the tone of the report is soft, then the British stock
market will receive support, and the pound will decline. Conversely, the
tough rhetoric of the report in relation to containing inflation,
implying an increase in the interest rate in the UK, will lead to the
strengthening of the pound.

###  **06:30 GBP Speech by Bank of England head Andrew Bailey**

Participants in financial markets are expecting him to clarify the
situation regarding the further [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the central bank of Great
Britain. The volatility during Andrew Bailey's speech could rise sharply
in the quotes of the pound and the index of the London Stock Exchange
FTSE, if he gives any hints of tightening or easing monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).

###  **12:30 USD Initial jobless claims in the US over the past week**

The situation on the country's labor market continues to deteriorate
rapidly. Back in February, the indicator of initial claims for
unemployment benefits was within its average values ​​of 193-252
thousand. However, then the situation began to deteriorate sharply. Over
the week of March 22-28, 6.9 million claims were submitted, then 6.606
million claims, shocking observers and market participants. A similar
indicator published last Thursday (for the week of April 19-25) came out
with a value of 3.839 million applications.

According to economists, in the past seven weeks, the US economy has
lost more than 30 million jobs, which implies an increase in
unemployment of almost 24%. This was not observed either during the
global financial crisis or during the Great Depression of the 1930s.
Every 1.5 million initial applications increase unemployment by 1
percentage point, and in less than two months, the US economy broke the
unemployment record of 23.6% achieved during the Great Depression.

Economists attribute this to the coronavirus, which has hit the US
economy. Many US companies announced layoffs, and authorities ordered
non-vital companies to close their offices and stores due to the
coronavirus epidemic. Eventually, the weekly growth rate of applications
far exceeded the previous record level of 695,000 reached in October
1982. Then the number of initial claims filed in four weeks amounted to
2.7 million. From March 29 to April 4, 2020, unemployment benefits were
received by 12 million Americans, which also became a new record. The
previous record was set a week earlier when 7.4 million people received
benefits - the highest since the recession of 2007-2009.

This indicator reflects the state of the labor market. An increase in
value negatively affects consumption and economic growth. Under normal
conditions, a high result weakens the US dollar, while a low one
strengthens it. However, in the current environment (the coronavirus
pandemic and a sharp economic slowdown), the reaction of market
participants to the publication of this report by the US Department of
Labor can be completely unpredictable.

###  **Friday, May 8**

On this day, Europe will celebrate Victory in the 2nd World War.
European banks will be closed; trading volumes will be low.

###  **12:30 USD Average hourly wages. Non-Farm Payrolls. Unemployment
rate**

These are the most important indicators of the state of the labor market
in the US in April. Forecast: +0.2% (against +0.4% in March) /
-20,000,000 (against -701,000 in March) / 14.0% (against 3.5% in
February and 4.4% in March ), respectively.

In general, the indicators can be described as disappointing, but
understandable due to massive layoffs in American companies and the
closure of offices and shops because of the coronavirus.

Prior to coronavirus, the US labor market remained strong, indicating
the stability of the US economy and supporting dollar quotes.

Predicting market reactions to the publication of indicators is often
difficult, because many indicators for previous periods may be revised.
Now it will be even more difficult to do, because the economic situation
in many other large economies is no better. In any case, during the
publication of data from the US labor market, a surge in volatility is
expected in trading not only in the USD, but throughout the financial
market. The most cautious [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s may prefer to stay out of the market
during this period of time.

###  **12:30 CAD Unemployment rate in Canada**

Statistics Canada will publish data on the country's labor market for
April.

Unemployment in January in the country decreased slightly (to 5.5%
compared to 5.6% in December), but rose again to 5.6% in February and
7.8% in March. If unemployment continues to rise, the Canadian dollar
will decline. If the data turn out to be better than the previous value,
the Canadian dollar will strengthen. A decrease in unemployment is a
positive factor for the CAD, an increase in unemployment is a negative
factor. Forecast for April: 7.2%.
