Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 14.10.2020Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I suggest entry signals
to trade each cryptocurrency.

The XRPUSD is forming the final leg of the bullish correction. Wave (5)
of [c] is an ending diagonal. It will end when wave 5 finishes, so the
market should be rising to level 0.266. One could enter purchases.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

 ****

The BTCUSD market is now forming the upward linking wave [X]. It is a
double zigzag, where the sub-waves (W) and (X) have completed, and the
(Y) wave is still unfolding. The (Y) looks like a double zigzag,
composed of the sub-waves W-X-Y. Wave Y is about to end soon, as its
final impulse wave has completed by 4/5. Therefore, the market should be
rising in wave (5) towards a level of 11943.67.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 11448.75, TP 11943.67

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

 ****

The current XRPUSD market is following a downtrend. There is likely to
be developing a bear zigzag A-B-C. Wave A is a five-wave downward
impulse. Corrective wave B is still unfolding as a zigzag [a]-[b]-[c].
The final section of the [c] impulse, wave (5), is an ending diagonal,
as wave 4 exceeded wave 1. The market could continue rising in the final
wave 5 towards a level of 0.266.

### Trading plan for **[XRPUSD][2]** today:

Buy 0.254, TP 0.266

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

 ****

The ETHUSD market is forming a bear zigzag A-B-C. There is now forming a
bullish correction B. It is developing as a double zigzag [W]-[X]-[Y].
The most recent section of the chart displays the final impulse wave
(C), which is an element of the zigzag-shaped wave [Y]. The corrective
wave 4 has finished within the (C) impulse. So, the market could be
rising in wave 5. The Ethereum price should be growing to a level of
400.37.

### Trading plan  **[ETHUSD][3] **today:

Buy 381.87, TP 400.37
