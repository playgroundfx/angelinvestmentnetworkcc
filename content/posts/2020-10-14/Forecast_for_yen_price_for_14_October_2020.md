Yen has got a whale in the pond. Analysis as of 14/10/2020Dmitri
Demidenko

Bank of Japan’s monetary expansion potential is limited: it already owns
a major part of [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/)s and the debt market, and that makes it the whale in
the pond.  Let’s talk about how that can affect the yen, and make a
trading plan for [EURJPY][1]

## Monthly fundamental forecast for yen

The US election race made the traders completely forget about the
Japanese yen, though it was the most interesting currency in September,
able to grow on political uncertainty. However, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s preferred the
US dollar as the main safe haven asset, while the [S&P 500][2]’s rally
amid Joe Biden’s growing popularity forced [USDJPY][3] and [EURJPY][1]
bears to defend themselves. The yen revived only on the rumour that the
blue wave wouldn't fall on the White House and the Congress.

Why are the US stock indexes growing in October? That discussion could
be long. The economy remains resistant to the tense epidemiological
state and continues growing steadily.  The Wall Street’s forecasts of Q3
downbeat corporate reports are getting better. The Fed pumped liquidity
into the markets, and will hold rates low for a long time. Finally, Joe
Biden’s victory will give the green light to a new relief package. It’s
the last factor that the [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s count on, pushing the S&P 500
upwards. However, the index may fall into consolidation as the situation
is in fact ambiguous.

If the Republicans continue to control the Senate, they will  puts a
spoke in Biden’s wheel and thus keep the political uncertainty. That
will give a hand to both the dollar and the yen. [USDJPY][3]’s
connection to the US stock indexes isn’t occasional. Japan’s residents
are paying more attention to foreign markets amid Japanese obligations’
low investment appeal. At the same time, the S&P 500’s correction is a
good opportunity to buy not only JPY vs USD, but also JPY vs Euro.

What worked out with [EURUSD][4] in summer may be as efficient with
[EURJPY][1] in the next two or three months. I mean the divergence
between monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) and economic growth. The ECB is freely using
verbal interventions and hinting at QE expansion, but the Bank of Japan
can’t do that. It has been buying out assets so aggressively, that its
balance is now 137% of GDP.

### Central banks’ balance dynamics

The BoJ’s current share in the debt and [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/) markets is 44% and 71%,
respectively. The regulator is fairly compared with a whale in the pond.
The more it increases its balance, the more cataclysms the [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s
will have to deal with after the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) gets back to normal.

### Monthly trading plan for [**EURJPY**][1]

The IMF may forecast that Japanese and European GDPs will grow 2.3% and
5.2% respectively, but the eurozone’s economic growth will most likely
speed up only in Q2. Until then, the second COVID-19 wave in Europe and
Japan’s better epidemiological state allow us to exploit the economic
growth divergence and sell [EURJPY][1] at 122.9 and 121.8.
