Short-term forecast for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 14.10.2020Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my colleagues! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for day traders.

Yesterday, the gold prices fell in the medium-term trend.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

Hardly anything has changed in the oil medium-term chart. The price is
trading between Target Zone 5 [41.67 - 40.92] and the key support of the
uptrend [37.34 – 36.72]. Trade at the borders of the trading range
according to the patterns.

The short-term oil trend is up, the upside target is Target Zone [42.56
– 42.01]. This week, traders tried to correct the price down to
Intermediary Zone [38.85 – 38.60]. They failed. The price is now trading
under the local resistance Additional Zone [40.40 – 40.27].

There are two trading scenarios in this situation:

  1. Sell oil in the correction at Additional Zone [40.40 - 40.27]

  2. Buy oil in the trend at Intermediary Zone [38.85 - 38.60]

Expect trading signals to confirm the idea either to sell or to buy.
There have not emerged any entry signals yet.

### [USCrude ][1]trading ideas for today:

  1. Sell according to the pattern in Additional Zone [40.40 - 40.27]. TakeProfit: Intermediary Zone [38.85 - 38.60].StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.
  2. Buy according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone [38.85 - 38.60]. TakeProfit: 41.35, Target Zone [42.56 - 42.01]. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

Yesterday, gold prices fell in the medium-term trend. The quotes rolled
down from the zone of good sell prices [1951.0 - 1913.1]. Bears are
trying to break out the trendline. If they do, the price will continue
declining with a target at the lows of September.

The short-term gold trend is up. The upside target is Target Zone
[1951.0 - 1941.7].

Yesterday, the market broke out the support Additional Zone [1906.9 –
1904.3]. Today, bears have tried to draw the price down to the key
support Intermediary Zone [1880.7 – 1875.4].

The price hasn’t reached IZ. The support is likely to be tested.

The price is now being corrected up following yesterday’s drop. The
correction target is to test the new Additional Zone [1911.3 – 1908.7]
drawn from today’s low.

There are two trading scenarios for today: Sell in Additional Zone
[1911.3 - 1908.7] or buy in Intermediary Zone [1880.7 - 1875.4]. We
shall select the relevant idea according to a corresponding pattern.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

  1. Sell according to the pattern in  Additional Zone [1911.3 - 1908.7]. TakeProfit: Intermediary Zone [1880.7 - 1875.4]. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. Buy according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone [1880.7 - 1875.4]. TakeProfit: Target Zone [1951.0 - 1941.7]. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

EURUSD rolled down from the key resistance of the medium-term downtrend
yesterday. The price is now testing the support [1.1733 – 1.1725]. If
the support is broken out with the consolidation below, the euro will
continue falling down to Target Zone 2 [1.1611 - 1.1591]. If the support
is held up, the price should break through the local high.

Let us switch to a shorter timeframe and analyze the short-term trend.

The trend is up as of now. The price was corrected down to Intermediary
Zone [1.1731 – 1.1721]. The correction continues today.

I believe yesterday’s low will be broken through. Once the price hits a
new [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) low, we shall see if bears will consolidate the price below IZ
and turn the trend down.

Until the trend reverses, it is relevant to buy according to the pattern
with a target at the high of October 9.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

Buy according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone [1.1731 - 1.1721].
TakeProfit: 1.1827. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.
