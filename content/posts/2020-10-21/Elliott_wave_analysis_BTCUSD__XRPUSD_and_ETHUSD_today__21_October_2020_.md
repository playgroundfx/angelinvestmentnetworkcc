Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 21.10.2020Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I suggest entry signals
to trade each cryptocurrency.

Ripple and Ethereum form the final parts of the ending diagonals. Price
increases are expected in the near future.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

 ****

We see the development of the middle part of the global double zigzag,
in other words, an upward linking wave [X] is being built. The structure
of wave [X] also shows a double zigzag (W)-(X)-(Y), where the last part,
the subwave (Y), is developing. Wave (Y) consists of three sub-waves
A-B-C. Wave A in the form of an impulse and a correction B in the form
of a zigzag have already formed, and an impulse wave C is developing.
The price growth in the indicated wave could continue to the high
reached previously by wave A, that is, to the level of 12490.56.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 12200.00, TP 12490.56

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

 ****

We see the construction of a corrective wave B, taking the shape of a
zigzag [a]-[b]-[c]. Wave [a] is a simple impulse, correction [b] is a
simple zigzag. Wave [c] is also an impulse, the final part of which
takes the form of an ending diagonal, that is, sub-wave (5). In the near
future, the price could rise in wave 5 to the level of 0.260. At this
level, the entire correction B would be 38.2% of the bearish impulse
wave A.

### Trading plan for **[XRPUSD][2]** today:

Buy 0.246, TP 0.260

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

 ****

An upward corrective wave B is developing, it takes the form of a double
zigzag [W]-[X]-[Y]. As part of this pattern, the first two parts have
been fully completed and now the third part, subwave [Y], is developing.
This wave is a simple bullish zigzag (A)-(B)-(C). As part of an impulse
wave (C), which is developing right now, wave 5 is formed, which takes
the form of an ending diagonal. As the four parts of the ending diagonal
seem to be complete, in the near future there will be an increase in
wave [5] of 5 to the previous high - 394.20.

### Trading plan  **[ETHUSD][3] **today:

Buy 376.77, TP 394.20
