Pound: there’s always hope. Analysis as of 21.10.2020Dmitri Demidenko

The pound appears to have used a vaccine: it doesn’t react to negative
Brexit headlines and believes that a no matter what deal will be signed.
Let’s discuss that and make a trading plan for [GBPUSD][1].

## Monthly fundamental forecast for pound

Both parties should make an effort to reach a result. The European Union
and Britain understand the consequences of an economic breakup provoked
by a no-deal Brexit. However, Boris Johnson’s behaviour has been
provocative, and Brussels excuses that. Why? They know that the British
PM has to gain the eurosceptics’ favour, which is hard to do. As a
result, London’s loud statements are seen as nothing but showing-off.
Investors don’t believe Johnson’s single word and the pound remains
stable, even if the talks appear to have ended in a deadlock.

After the 2016 Brexit referendum, the traders grew immune to Brexit
[news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/). The same story repeated itself every year: one had to live through
a hopeless period and then catch a chance at the last moment, exploiting
the [GBPUSD][1]’s hike after breakout [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/). For example, that happened
in autumn 2019, when Boris Johnson induced Brussels to sign an
agreement, threatening not to extend the prolongation period. That will
probable happen again now. That’s why Johnson’saying that Michel Barnier
shouldn’t come to London without any constructive suggestions (i.e.
concessions) is read as an artificial provocation.

The belief in a Brexit deal allows the pound to grow even amid the
economy’s weakness and rumor of negative rates introduction. According
to the Bloomberg’s leading indicators, the eurozone’s recovery is
slowing down, the US is gradually catching up with Europe, and the UK is
the worst preformer.

Thus, it’s unsurprising that member of Monetary Policy Committee Gertjan
Vlieghe says openly he is ready to support a QE extension worth £745
billion, and demands a deeper study of negative rates’ impact on the
economy.

Even Moody’s downgrade of the UK sovereign debt rating doesn’t help
[GBPUSD][1] bears, although it’s supposed to withdraw money from the UK
debt market.  In fact, the rating is still above the junk level, and the
BoE is buying out securities so passionately, that a price fall isn’t a
discussion topic.

Donald Trump’s loss of reputation supports [GBPUSD ][1]bulls. According
to Financial Times’ and Peterson Fund’s latest surveys, 46% of Americans
think the current president’s policies harmed the economy. Thus, market
pessimists prevail, for the first time since the beginning of 2020.
Before COVID-19 locked down the States in March, the optimists had a
11-point advantage.

### Range of opinions of Trump’s influence on economy

A solid economy is perhaps Trump’s most powerful argument for re-
election. If he’s losing his ground there, the White House may be
expected to change its tenant. And [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s got used to the fact that
what is bad for Trump is bad for the dollar too.

### Monthly trading plan for [**GBPUSD**][1]

A Brexit deal and the US Blue Wave may have brought [GBPUSD][1] to 1.34
as early as by mid-November. Continue buying the pound at pullbacks.
