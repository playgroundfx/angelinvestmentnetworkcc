EUR/USD forecast: Fed saves the dollarDmitri Demidenko

## Fundamental US dollar forecast for today

### US central bank won’t ease monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)

One quickly gets used to good things. Massive injections of liquidity to
manage the recession resulted from the pandemic allowed [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s to
call the Fed insane. They hoped that it would continue. However, the
minutes of the FOMC July meeting proved that the central bank acts
wisely. The Fed is not stupid; it is rather sensible, willing to work
according to the circumstances. When the market’s expectations are not
met, traders start exiting trades, which results in a correction. The
[EUR/USD][1] is no exception.

Investors bet that the Fed would signal its willingness to put up with
the inflation above the 2% target, to start yield curve control [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/),
and, finally, to lower the interest rates below zero. Nothing like that
happened. The central bank, which had previously announced that it was
considering the control of the US Treasury yield, noted in the minutes
that this was not necessary. Officials insist that the Fed’s monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) is already ultra-easy, so if the economic situation, it will
focus on the duration of keeping interest rates at current levels. The
interest rate hike depends on the targets on inflation and unemployment.

Fed seems to be unwilling to ease monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) and hinder the growth
of the US Treasury yield. If so, the US dollar should benefit from the
more robust US domestic data, which would lead to the rise of the bond
rates. And there are positive changes already! They are yet surprising
amid the problematic situation with the COVID-19. However, they could be
seen as a regularity soon.

The crucial error of economists that they expected people to avoid
spending during hard times. However, online shopping, mobile apps,
fiscal stimulus, and the boredom during the lockdown resulted in the
growth in revenue of major American retailers. It means the US retail
sales, consumer demand, and the GDP data will be secure.

The White House has the same opinion. Its mantra about the V-shaped
recovery of the US economy seemed ridiculous not long ago. White House
chief economic adviser Larry Kudlow still claims that the US GDP is
recovering very fast, and the cut in the unemployment benefits from $600
to $300 per week means the US economy is getting stronger. So, the US
economic data are positive; the [S&P500][4] hits fresh all-time highs,
the Fed doesn’t sound more dovish than earlier. These factors raise
doubts in such a driver as the divergence in the economic growth between
the euro area and the US. It makes the [EUR/USD][1] correction more
likely.

After an impressive three-month rally, the euro bulls need a rest. If
the [EUR/USD][1] goes below 1.1815-1.182, it could continue falling
towards 1.1755, 1,.1725, and 1.1675, which should be followed by the
middle-term consolidation.
