Analysis for oil, gold and, EUR/USD for 20.08.2020Alex Rodionov

##  **Oil price forecast** **for** **today:** ** **USCrude****
******analysis**

WTI oil is trading in the middle-term uptrend with an upside target at
Target Zone 6 [49.17 - 48.42]. The week, I recommend entering purchases
according to the pattern in the broken-out TZ5 and in the key support
zone [37.23 – 36.61] if the price reaches it in the correction.

In the shorter timeframe, oil is trading in the short-term uptrend.
Bulls are trying to break out the resistance Additional Zone [42.70 –
42.55]. The price is trading under the resistance, so we enter sell
trades with the target at the trend key support Intermediary Zone [40.33
– 40.02].

If AZ is broken out with the consolidation, we shall buy oil, and the
upside target will be Gold Zone 5 [45.04 - 44.67].

The trend key support is far from the current prices, in the zone of
[40.33 — 40.02].

##  **Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis**

Amid yesterday’s [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/), the gold prices fell to the key support of the
middle-term uptrend, according to the methodology. The key support is in
the zone of [1922.4 - 1913.1]. We shall monitor buyers’ activity in this
zone in the next few days. If there is a buy pattern, we shall enter a
long trade with the target at the high of this week.

Let us study the shorter timeframe to identify the short-term trend. The
gold price broke out Additional Zone [1992.2 – 1989.9], where I
recommended entering sell trades on the retest with the target in the
Intermediary Zone [1969.0 – 1964.3].

Next, sellers broke out IZ as well, thus turning the short-term trend
down. Expect the test of Target Zone [1922.4 – 1913.1] until the end of
this week.

Today, I recommend entering sell trades according to the pattern in
Additional Zone [1950.2 - 1947.9] and Intermediary Zone [1975.8 —
1971.2].

##  **Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis**

The euro bulls failed to consolidate the price above Target Zone 4
[1.1914 – 1.1896] at a first try. As a result, the price rolled down
under the resistance, and there started a correction down. The
correction target is likely to be the test of the trend key support
Target Zone 4 [1.1914 - 1.1896]. I recommend entering new purchases in
the key support zone with a target at the high of this week.

The short-term euro trend reversed down, amid the FOMC [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/). The upside
scenario didn’t work out as the price didn’t reach Gold Zone [1.1993 -
1.1984].

Starting from today, we shall enter sell trades on the correction in the
strong resistance zones: Additional Zone [1.1880 - 1.1876] и
Intermediary Zone [1.1930 – 1.1921].

It will be relevant to buy the eurusd when the trend turns up via the IZ
breakout and the consolidation above.

###  **[EURUSD][9] Trading ideas for today:**

  1. Sell according to the pattern in Additional Zone [1.1880 - 1.1876]. TakeProfit: 1.1832, Target Zone [1.1783 - 1.1765]. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. Sell according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone [1.1930 - 1.1921]. TakeProfit: 1.1832, Target Zone [1.1783 - 1.1765]. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

breakout.
