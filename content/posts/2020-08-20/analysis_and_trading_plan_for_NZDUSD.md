Analysis of NZDUSD and forecast for the NZD priceMikhail Hypov

This analysis is devoted to the New Zealand dollar’s prospects, the
currency that is tenderly called “kiwi” after a popular local bird.

The article covers the following subjects:

## General analysis of NZDUSD

When delving into the peculiarities of trading this currency, we need to
mention the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, or RBNZ. This establishment
[functions](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/basic-functions/) like the Fed in the USA, and its monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) is ultra
soft. Last Wednesday, the RBNZ dropped the refinance rate to the
historic low of 0.25%. However, this event is predictable and fits well
into the global trend. What draws a particular attention is RBNZ
Governor Adrian Orr’s ultra-soft rhetoric. He says the RBNZ will
continue and even extend its monetary easing [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). Mr Orr said the
bank had been preparing to use the negative refinance rate and expand
the bond-buying programme.

NZDUSD][1]

The effect produced by RBNZ Governor’s statement is best seen in the US
and NZ bond yields chart above. These two indicators don’t always
correlate, but recently, their evolutions have become totally opposite.
The blue NZ bond yield curve is directed downwards while the orange US
10-year bond yield curve is directed upwards. If we extend this
situation to the NZDUSD rate, we’ll see a strong bearish pressure on the
NZ dollar from the fundamental point of view. Objectively, the NZ dollar
is under pressure due to the expectations that arise from Adrian Orr’
speeches. It’s a tricky situation for sellers because markets may
gradually factor all the risks in the price.  COVID-19 and the fear of
another wave may fuel the bearish flame too. I need to remind you that
over 10% of New Zealand’s GDP comes from tourism. The borders are still
closed, and if the number of new cases increases, there’s no chance that
the situation in the tourist sector will improve. These fears put a
strong pressure on the kiwi’s rate and they need to be considered when
making forecasts. On the whole, the NZD looks weak in the short term.
Let’s check this presumption using analytical tools.

## Technical analysis of NZDUSD

![LiteForex: Forecast for the NZ dollar: analysis and trading plan for
NZDUSD][2]

As usual, let’s examine the 12-month time frame first. The bearish trend
prevailed from the 70s and up to the 00s. An ascending wave starts in
2002. The latest candlestick broke the bearish channel line with a
strong pullback. The correction of the latest candlestick broke 0.382
Fib of the bearish trend and failed to reach the 0.232 level. This fact
allows us to expect a future reversal and an impulse wave structure’s
eventual development. The key support levels are 0.512 USD and 0.413
USD, the bottom of the 2002 growing wave.  The key resistance level is
in the area of the 40-year maximum at 0.883 USD.

NZDUSD][3]

A whole series of bullish signals confirm a potential reversal on the
monthly time frame:

  1. NZDUSD went outside the bearish trading channel and is located in the highest market activity zone.
  2. The downtrend was broken amidst growing trading volumes.
  3. TD Alignment indicator crossed the balance level from below and reserves potential for growth.
  4.  MACD moving averages show a bullish divergence with the price while the histogram moved to the positive zone.

NZDUSD][4]

On a weekly time frame, NZDUSD’s dynamics becomes more bearish based on
a few signals:

  1. The price reached the balance level according to the Pivot indicator and failed to consolidate above.
  2. At the beginning of 2020, the kiwi collapsed against the dollar, going outside the limits of TD candlestick annual projection marked as a grey rectangle.  Thus, the price is unlikely to consolidate above the tolerance zone  - the violet rectangle - in 2020.
  3. The local uptrend is accompanied with falling trade volumes. The impulse is fading.
  4. TD Alignment left the overbought zone and is directed downwards.

![LiteForex: Forecast for the NZ dollar: analysis and trading plan for
NZDUSD][5]

On the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame, we see a clear five-wave impulse with extension
in the first wave.  The price broke the bullish trend, having marked the
end of the whole structure and a transition to a correction, where wave
A already reached an important level of 0.5 of the fifth wave and may be
considered to be completed.  With the bullish sentiment of the monthly
time frame, correction ABC is likely to stay within the limits of the
fifth wave and the white area of the trading channel.

Four signals confirm the correction on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame:

  1. The bullish trend is crossed from above.
  2. The price’s located below the Pivot balance level of the monthly pattern.
  3. Sellers’ trade volumes are growing.
  4. TD Alignment crossed the balance level from above, which reserves room for a further decrease.

Having analysed the pair on the Y1 to D1 time frames, we can form a
trading plan for the period from a few months and up to several years.

## Trading plan for the NZD for August-September 2020

![LiteForex: Forecast for the NZ dollar: analysis and trading plan for
NZDUSD][6]

A bearish scenario is given priority on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame in the
nearest month. The level for opening short positions is at 0.6625, the
limit of the TD tolerance zone. The current price isn’t really
attractive, but since wave C is very likely to begin, we can have a
small volume of short positions at 0.655 USD not to miss the move. Stop
loss should be placed above the fifth wave’s peak at 0.6715. As the
white trading channel and the fourth wave’s bottom limit the correction,
the target of short positions is in the range of 0.636 - 0.635 USD.
Based on the entry point, the risk/reward ratio varies from 3 (0.662
USD) to1.32 (0.655 USD).

## Long-term trading plan for NZDUSD for the end of 2020 and the
beginning of 2021

![LiteForex: Forecast for the NZ dollar: analysis and trading plan for
NZDUSD][7]

Based on the previous monthly scenario and trading signals, I can say
that long positions will be given priority in the next 6 months. The
entry point is supposed to be at the lower limit of the white trading
channel of 0.634 USD.  The breakout of the 30 September local low at
0.620 USD from above will cancel this scenario. Thus, losses should be
fixed below that level. Profits may be fixed in part at 0.670 USD, the
area of the fifth wave’s peak.  The upper channel limit at around 0.74
USD may be considered to be the final target.  This trade is relatively
safe as the Profit/Risk ratio is over 5. Still, your personal risk
management rules should never be neglected.

## Multi-year trading plan for NZDUSD

![LiteForex: Forecast for the NZ dollar: analysis and trading plan for
NZDUSD][8]

The situation isn’t clear in a multi-year context. On the one hand, the
global ascending trend was broken; on the other hand, it returned to its
trading range and went out above the local bearish channel. Most likely,
the kiwi won’t be allowed to consolidate substantially, given the
negative fundamental background. However,  NZDUSD won’t be in a stable
long-term trend because of the US soft monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). If the NZ dollar
should consolidate, it won’t exceed 0.74 - 0.75 USD. The accumulation of
local resistance levels will hamper a further movement.  The key level
for cancelling the bearish scenario is at 0.751 USD, marked as a red
segment.  If the price gets higher, the next target of the global
bullish trend may be expected at 0.88 USD. The key level for confirming
the bearish scenario is the lower limit of the global bullish trend
(green segment). In this case, a strong support level at 0.5124 USD will
be the next target.
