BTCUSD is likely to be forming an upward global zigzag A-B-C. The market
should have completed the bullish impulse wave A that is composed of
five sub-waves. Next, the market turned down and started forming the
beginning of the new downtrend. Presumably, the market should be
declining to a level below the previous low, hit by the correction (4),
which is below 11108.00.

The XRPUSD market should have finished the upward linking wave [X] as a
simple zigzag. Next, the market turned down, and the price started
declining in the new downtrend. The price is likely to continue falling
to a level below 0.267, which is the previous low. This low was made by
correction 4. Under the current conditions, one could enter short
trades.
