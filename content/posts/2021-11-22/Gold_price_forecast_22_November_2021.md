Gold is set to decline. Forecast as of 22.11.2021Dmitri Demidenko

According to [XAUUSD][1] bulls, the gold rally is based on high
inflation. However, [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/)ly, the precious metal has not reacted to
inflation, but to what the Fed thinks about inflation. What has changed
now? Let us discuss the Forex outlook and make up a gold trading plan.

## Fundamental gold forecast for a week

The price of gold will have to fall no matter how good it looks in the
short term due to the [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/)ly low real yields on US Treasury bonds.
The strong dollar, the hawkish Fed, and the US economy's willingness to
withstand higher debt rates allow me to recommend selling [XAUUSD][1].
No matter how high the price of gold has risen.

According to the USB, the fair value of gold is $1,910 per ounce. This
forecast is based on the TIPS yield and the USD index. However, the bank
lowered its forecast for the gold price for 2022 from $1,900 to $1,860,
citing its inability to compete with Bitcoin. The USB officials probably
believe that the lack of capital inflows into gold-focused [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/)s is
caused by the flow of money into the crypto market. In my opinion, the
reason is different. XAU buyers are well aware of the speculative nature
of the gold rally and are reluctant to buy what looks too expensive
today. Indeed, according to the CFTC, hedge funds have increased their
gold net longs to their highest levels in ten months.

Speculators rely on fast-growing inflation. In the US, Canada and the
UK, it reached the highest levels in several decades. In Turkey, Brazil
and Argentina it accelerated to double digits.

### Inflation dynamics

The problem is that gold price reacts not to inflation, but to what the
Fed officials think about inflation. As long as the Fed continued the
mantra about the temporary nature of high PCE, the precious metal was
doing just fine. But currently, FOMC officials deny both the longer-term
nature of price growth, associated not only with supply chains, but also
with domestic demand, and the frenzied pace of labor market recovery.
According to Christopher Waller, at the current rate of increase in
employment, unemployment will very soon return to 4%. This will allow
raising the federal funds rate in the second quarter.

The Fed Vice President, Richard Clarida, stated that the issue of
accelerating the QE tapering will be discussed in December. This led to
an increase in the probability of three acts of monetary restriction in
2022 significantly above 50%, although a month ago it was about 25%.
This contributes to both the rally in Treasury yields and the
strengthening of the dollar, as well as an increase in its volatility,
which is an alarming signal for gold.

### Weekly gold trading plan

The possible appointment of Lael Brainard as chairman of the Fed serves
as a risk factor for the [XAUUSD][1] bulls. If that happens, the chances
of an aggressive monetary tightening in 2022, Treasury yields and
greenback yields will drop for a while. However, rates will rise anyway.
This circumstance gives reason to adhere to the [previous][2] strategy
of gold sales. XAU inability to return above $1850 is a sign of the
bulls' weakness and a reason for the shorts' formation.
