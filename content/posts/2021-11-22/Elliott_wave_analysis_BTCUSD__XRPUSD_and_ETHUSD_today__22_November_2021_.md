Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 22.11.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

The BTCUSD market is forming the final leg of the bearish impulse that
will soon be completed. Next, the price should be rising in the bullish
correction.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

The first leg of the new bearish simple zigzag (A)-(B)-(C) is currently
forming. The down sub-wave (A) is unfolding as a five-wave impulse
1-2-3-4-5. The descending impulse sub-waves 1 and 3, and corrective sub-
wave, zigzags, have completed. There is developing the final sub-wave 5,
which should finish at a level of 54690.00. When the indicated level is
reached, the market could start rising as outlined in the chart.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Sell 57392.00, TP 54690.00

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

The XRPUSD market is developing the large linking wave (X) as a
contracting triangle A-B-C-D-E. The first three legs of the triangle
should have completed, and there is developing the fourth sub-wave of
the pattern, the down wave D, as a double zigzag [W]-[X]-[Y]. The motive
wave [Y] should conclude the D wave. The (C) should soon conclude the
[Y] wave. When the (C) wave completes, the market should start rising in
the final wave E to a level above 1.085, marked by correction (B).

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] **** today:

Buy 1.036, TP 1.085

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

The ETHUSD market is forming the initial part of the new corrective
trend as a double zigzag. Within the potential zigzag, the down motive
wave (W) has finished. There is developing the linking wave (X) as a
simple zigzag A-B-C. The bearish correction B should have finished, so
the price should soon be rising in the bullish impulse C towards a level
of 4650.00, where wave (X) will be 76.4% of wave (W).

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Buy 4170.78, TP 4650.00
