Isn’t euro undervalued? Forecast as of 22.11.2021Dmitri Demidenko

New lockdowns in Europe, the energy crisis, and the return of the Brexit
topic press down the [EURUSD][1]. Furthermore, the divergence in the
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the Fed and the ECB encourages the euro bears.
However, the euro might be undervalued. Let us discuss the Forex outlook
and make up a trading plan.

## Weekly euro fundamental forecast

A new pandemic wave has started in Europe, and there are new lockdowns.
At the same time, the FOMC officials are discussing a faster tapering of
the stimulus than financial markets currently expect. The [EURUSD][1] is
naturally going down. The turnover in the euro-dollar [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) has
significantly surged, puts are outpacing calls by 4-to-3. The risk
reversals have been the most bearish for the euro since May 2020, and
the volatility surge to the highest levels since March signals a
potential plunge in the single European currency to $1.113 in the next
three months.

Austria has been the first country in the euro-area to return to a
nationwide lockdown; Germany does not exclude such a possibility, and
the Netherlands closed restaurants and bars amid an increase in the
number of COVID-19 cases. Fear has struck not only the unvaccinated but
also those who received both injections, leading to a slowdown in
economic activity and growth. The euro-area PMIs are likely to show a
decline in November. This will suggest the euro-area GDP slowdown in the
fourth quarter, which, against the background of the US GDP rise, is one
of the strong arguments for selling the [EURUSD][1].

A new wave of the pandemic, the return of the Brexit topic, and the
energy crisis in Europe could force the ECB to abandon its plans to cut
the emergency asset purchase programme of €1.85 trillion by March. On
the contrary, the Fed is weighing the prospects of speeding the QE taper
process, according to Richard Clarida and Christopher Waller. Waller
says he would like to see the end of the $120-billion program in the
first quarter, in order to raise the federal funds rate in the second,
if necessary. He notes that borrowing costs are currently at zero, so
even a small increase will still keep monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) ultra-easy. The
official suggests the Fed should consider reducing the balance sheet
size, which currently stands at $8.6 trillion. __

Although the FOMC composition is constantly changing, the US central
bank repeats the same mistake again and again. The Fed has been
maintaining low interest rates for too long, counting on a soon
inflation slowdown. The dovish tone of the US [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers stifles long-
term savings and private sector investment, which negatively affects the
economy. And while there are signs that supply chain problems are being
resolved, the Fed’s refusal to keep inflation at 2% is driving
inflationary expectations up.

### Weekly [EURUSD][1] trading plan

The highlight of the week ending November 26 will be the releases of the
meetings’ minutes of the FOMC and the ECB and the PMI data in the euro
area and the USA. There will also be published the report on the US PCE,
the Fed’s preferred inflation indicator. The week is rich in economic
events. In the meanwhile, I would like to note that the [EURUSD][1]
bulls’ failure to keep the price above 1.133 has signaled their
weakness. The above-mentioned level is now a strong resistance level.
The support is at 1.122.
