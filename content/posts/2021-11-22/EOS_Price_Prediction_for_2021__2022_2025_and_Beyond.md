EOS Price Prediction for 2021, 2022-2025 and BeyondJana Kane

EOS is the native cryptocurrency for EOSIO, an open-source [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/)
technology that allows developers to build decentralized applications or
‘dapps.’ It is a powerful player in the crypto world. Ethereum is
considered the main competitor to EOS. While Ethereum is far more
popular, experts know better than to equate popularity with quality. EOS
focuses on speed, scalability, and flexibility - all important things
that give it an edge in the eyes of experts.

What’s more, EOS tries to solve the problems of limited availability of
resources on the network, false transactions, similar requests, spamming
apps, and some more. 700 million tokens are being distributed on an
ongoing basis of 2 million per day for 350 days. What does the future
hold for those who are full of hope that EOS will increase? Let’s find
out about EOS and [crypto trading][1].

The article covers the following subjects:

This article will answer the most frequently asked questions about EOS,
cover its [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/), and show you EOS price predictions from the crypto
industry experts, as well as long-term forecasts of the coin. We’ll even
perform some technical analysis of the coin and its price fluctuations.

Once you've read about the past, present, and future outlook of
[EOS][2], hopefully, our article on EOS price prediction will help you
make an informed decision on whether it’s worth investing in the coin.
Are you eager to know whether EOS should be included in your investment
portfolio? Read on to learn about all the important aspects.

## What is EOS Crypto?

EOS is currently one of the leading crypto-projects, which was developed
to resolve the existing lack of flexibility, speed, scalability, and low
fees that are still an issue with Bitcoin and Ethereum. EOS operates on
its own [smart contract](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/smart-contract-on-blockchain/) platform for decentralized applications (dApps):
the EOS.IO [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) protocol, designed especially as a solution to
outperform regular processing and hardware storage, and much more
interesting stuff.

Back in 2017, EOS developers Brendan Blumer and Dan Larimer publicly
released their whitepaper, and the first EOS initial coin offering (ICO)
launched in June of the same year. It lasted an entire year and raised a
whopping $4.1 billion – breaking all ICO records at the time.

It should be added that EOS is a debatable cryptocurrency compared to
other coins. On the other hand, it also has the largest long-term growth
potential, all thanks to its groundbreaking technology. The EOS
[blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) protocol can potentially transform the future of all dApps
and computer resources drastically, in case it does refine the internal
processes in various industries, as promised by EOS’ developers. If so,
the coin’s long-term price will rise rapidly.

## EOS Price Predictions for the rest of 2021 by Crypto Experts

Cryptocurrencies are rife with volatility, and EOS is no different. The
constant fluctuations make it difficult to predict prices with a high
level of accuracy, but these experts have compiled their results based
on exhaustive analysis and research. Let’s take a look at their
opinions.

Overall, experts from Trading Beasts suppose that EOS will decline
during the rest of 2021 compared to the current levels. For the end of
December, the value of EOS will be $4.49. The maximum price will move
above $5. As for the minimum rate, the EOS may fall below $4 - ​​ $3.82.

The price is moving sideways, which is always tricky. However, according
to Wallet Investor, EOS will rise steadily. The overall trend for
December is optimistic. The month will start at $4.76. On the last day
of 2021, EOS will have an average price of $6.57. The maximum price may
reach $9.40. As for the minimum rate, the price may decline to $2. The
source predicts high volatility in the final month of the year.

The Economy Forecast Agency shows figures that are not altogether
optimistic. There will be ups and downs. The price may rise slightly.
The highest rate throughout the rest of the year is envisaged as $6.40.
The growth is insignificant. The year 2021 will leave us with $5.64.
Unlike Wallet Investor, the source doesn’t predict increased volatility.

According to the Coin Price Forecast, the price of the EOS coin will hit

## EOSUSD Technical Analysis

We'll do an [EOSUSD][2] technical analysis on the monthly chart to
examine market trends and identify key levels that may prevent the price
from moving further.

As the above EOSUSD chart suggests, there was a dramatic struggle
between buyers and sellers in May, resulting in the long-legged Doji
formation.

The price then attempted to touch the lowest support level at 1.5 USD
but failed to do so in the presence of huge buying volumes. I marked
that development in blue on the volume indicator.

Thus, the price may potentially move to the upside from 1.5 USD to at
least 8.65 USD.

### EOSUSD price prediction for next three months

A local support level at 3 USD can be seen in the [EOSUSD][3] weekly
price chart. That level may be retested soon as EOS can't pull away from
its current levels despite huge trading volumes. If the EOS price chart
breaks successfully through the level of 3 USD, the next price target
will be the low of December 2018 at around 1.5 USD.

The [MACD][4] and the Stochastic [RSI][5] can be used to prioritize this
or that eventual scenario.

The EOS weekly time frame shows that both bulls and bears have been
active, which usually leads to less intense price movements.

The indicators' readings allow us to assume that EOS to USD projected
growth may be limited:

  * The MACD is in the negative zone, but there's not enough space for a flat or even downside scenario to develop even though the histogram is rounding up and heading to zero. There's no evident signal of bullish growth.

  * The Stochastic RSI is in the oversold area, which puts pressure on sellers.

Thus, the signals of these two indicators contradict one another and
indicate the market's equilibrium disposition. We won't most likely see
any drastic price moves in the EOSUSD, and the pair will continue
consolidating in a narrow price range.

### Long-Term EOS Analysis for 2021/2022

Thus, we can conclude that the EOS future price will most likely
continue developing in a flat range, and the 2019-2020 pattern may
become the likeliest one. I can single out three stages here:

  * Drastic growth and fall, marked with a red circle in the chart below. This stage can be called "bulls' failed attempt," and the market appears to be completing this stage at the moment.

  * "Attempt of revenge," marked with a purple circle -- a pullback of "hope" that is successfully neutralized by bears.

  * Consolidation (green oval) - an equilibrium stage that can be called "the calm before the storm." That stage may result in powerful momentum in any direction.

Based on that wave structure, the most realistic forecast, and the
latest signals, we will have short consolidation in the near time. A
short-term breakout at around 8 USD may occur at the end of the year.

Given the strong support levels, the pattern will most likely be
inclined upwards, allowing another powerful impulse to form in
2022-2023.

As our scenario is based on the EOSUSD price [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) in 2019-2020, the
forecast for 2021-2022 will reproduce the past wave structure. However,
that doesn't guarantee that the price moves will be 100% identical.

We will outline [EOS][2] expected trading range using Bollinger bands.

Orange squares mark expected price projections for each month. Sellers'
main task in 2021 will be breaking through support at 3 USD. The EOS
projected trading range will be 3-5 USD, but short-term breakouts can
happen too.

The price is supposed to have reached its lowest by the beginning of
2022, and bulls are then expected to revenge and consolidate on updated
support levels.

The table below presents projected minimums and maximums of the EOS
trading range for each month.

#### Long-term trading plan for EOS

Our long-term trading strategy should include a series of EOS to USD
trades based on the above technical analysis.

The EOS price chart is currently attempting to break through support at
3 USD. The first buy order should be placed close to that level, at
around 3.15-3.30 USD (blue dots in the chart above). Stop Loss should be
placed at a safe level of 2.25 - 2.33 USD (red dots). As we aim to trade
in the range of 3-4.50 USD, Take Profit should be placed before the
upper limit of the range at around 4.30 - 4.40 USD (green dots).

Another trade aims to profit from a breakout of resistance at 4.50 USD.
If that level is retested from above, open a long position with a target
at 7.50 USD. If the price movement is less strong than expected, average
into the position buying at 3.75 USD and fix profits at around 6.40 USD.
Stop Loss: below 3 USD. Remember to observe risk management rules and
avoid losses exceeding 1% of your deposit per trade.

The [EOSUSD][2] price technical analysis is presented by[ Mikhail
Hypov][6].

## Weekly Elliott wave EOS analysis as of 22.11.2021

The EOSUSD market continues forming the global linking wave (X) as a
double zigzag composed of sub-waves W-X-Y. Wave W and corrective linking
wave X are double zigzags. The final motive wave Y could also be a
double zigzag [W]-[X]-[Y], as outlined in the chart. Let us study the
structure of the first motive wave [W], looking like a simple zigzag
(A)-(B)-(C) in the eight-hour timeframe.

Within the simple descending zigzag currently unfolding, the first down
wave (A) has completed as a five-wave impulse 1-2-3-4-5. Next, the
market continued trading flat. Corrective wave (B) is currently
unfolding as a contracting triangle A-B-C-D-E. The first four parts of
this triangle pattern seem to have completed, the final sub-wave E will
conclude the pattern. The price could shortly rise in wave E to a level
of 5.02. Next, the market will be declining, as outlined in the chart.

## EOS Price Prediction Chart 2022

The EOS trend of going up and down in cycles will remain in 2022. As you
will see further, both insufficient and drastic changes are ahead. The
biggest growth by the end of the year is expected by Long Forecast. Its
experts are sure that EOS will meet 2023 with a rate above $13. Experts
from other resources don’t share this excitement. Most analysts predict
a downtrend by the end of 2022.

January 2022 will begin with an average price of $4.50. By June, EOS is
believed to go down a little bit - its price will be $4.46. Still, the
price won’t be able to recover and will decline by the end of the year.
The last month will leave us with an average price of $4.23. Trading
Beasts expect the minimum price to fall below $4. The highest rate will
reach $5.63.

The first day of 2022 will greet us with $6.72. The price will already
break above $7 in January.  March is anticipated to be a negative month
for EOS [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s — the price will fall below $7 again. However, by the
end of April, EOS’s rate will skyrocket above $10. The increase won’t be
solid. EOS will return to the levels below $10 in the middle of May. A
downtrend will last until the middle of December when the price will
touch $6.95. By the end of December, the average price will be $8.33.

As you can see, the Economy Forecast Agency shows an optimistic angle of
the EOS price in 2022. The year will start with $5.64, June will end
with the result of $5.41. EOS will cost $13.18 at the end of 2022. It’s
the most optimistic projection for 2022.

EOS will start 2022 with a value of $6.37. In the first half of the
year, the price will fall to $6.17 and close the year at $6.77.

## EOS Price Prediction for 2023 by Crypto Experts

2023 won’t show stable growth. Some pretty harsh falls are expected.
Yet, the experts think it is not the reason to lose faith in EOS.

According to the Trading Beast EOS forecast, the average price in
January 2023 is $4.17. The source predicts a bearish trend until May —
the price will fall below $4. However, from May until the end of
October, EOS/USD will trade near $5.70. Bears will take control over the
market in November. December will leave us with $4.30.

January 2023, according to Wallet Investor, will start with $8.27. EOS
will quickly surge above $9. Again, March will become the worst month
for the cryptocurrency as the rate will fluctuate near $8. But in the
middle of April, the price will increase and touch $10. By the end of
the month, EOS will be at $12. From the middle of May, a new downtrend
will be in force. The cryptocurrency will slightly recover by the end of
December with an average price of $9.89.

Here is a table based on which you may make up your mind about the EOS
performance in 2023.

The price in 2023 will have high volatility. January will open up with
$13.18, and by the end of June, the value will have reached $17.86. The
closing price in December is expected to be just $13.96. This is the
most positive prediction for the value of EOS. What makes this
believable is the fact that the prices were around the same level in May
2021.

EOS will soar to $8.29 within the first six months of the year and
finish 2023 at $9.78. The Coin Price Forecast predicts a good rise
compared to the values in 2022.

## Long-Term EOS Price Prediction 2025-2030

As it’s challenging to make such long-term predictions, analysts’
forecasts differ a lot. Only time will tell who was more accurate.

Trading Beasts did not want to look so far into the future. They limited
themselves to 2024. At the beginning of the year, the value of EOS will
be $4.48. In the middle of the year, in June, the price will rise to
$5.28. Their last prognosis is for December 31, 2024 - the average price
is supposed to be $6.17.

January 2025 will begin with $11.73. At the end of April, the price will
skyrocket above $15. A bullish trend won’t prevail for long. The price
will fall below $15 by the end of May. At the beginning of December, the
price will be near $11. December 2025 will leave us with an average
price of $13.34. During January 2026, the price will move within the
$13-14 range. At the end of April, the price will rise to $17. From the
end of May, the price will decline. November 2026 is the last month for
which Wallet Investor has made its prognosis. It will begin with $13.55.

2025 will open at $17.01. With some ups and downs, we will reach the end
of June at $14.05. At the end of December 2025, the price is expected to
fall to $15.53. The Long Forecast has increased EOS’s expected rate
significantly.

According to Coin Price Forecast experts, EOS will be around $12.70 at
the beginning of 2025, then EOS will be pushed to $14.13 in the middle
of the year and end 2025 at $14.97. EOS/USD will start 2027 at $16.35,
but by the end of June, EOS will reach $17.23 and will continue to fall.
At the end of 2027, the valuation will be $16.45. The price will fall
throughout 2028. As a result, by the middle of 2029, the price will be
just $16.49. The end of 2029 will see the price rise to $17.36. By the
middle of 2030, the rate will reach $18.23. The downtrend will resume,
and the closing price of 2030 is expected to be $16.52.

### EOS: A Viable Long-Term Investment?

Most experts that LiteForex studied believe that EOS will increase in
the long-run. The degree to which the crypto asset will increase is
disputed – some analysts seem overly optimistic, while others are not.

Nevertheless, we can be justly assured that EOS will increase in value
significantly by the end of 2025. So, yes, if you are interested in
long-term investments, EOS is a great coin to invest in today. As we
mentioned earlier, however, if you’re not in it for the long run, it
would be a better idea to trade EOS. Again, all long-term forecasts are
very approximate and can be influenced by [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/), political and economic
[regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/)s, and other factors.

## EOS Today and in History: How Has the Price of EOS Changed Over Time?

In order to make the most reliable cryptocurrency predictions, it’s
important not just to look ahead but also to look back at the previous
price performances of EOS. Here’s how much the value of EOS changed from
its launch on July 2, 2017 to November 15, 2021:



 _Source: CoinMarketCup_

The first whitepaper of EOS was established in 2017. The open-source
software was released on the 1st of June, 2018. It was the most highly
anticipated [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) project of all time. The ICO gathered $4 billion,
which was a record-breaking amount at the time.

EOS experienced a significant fall in December 2018-January 2019. The
price was $1.93, while the highest one before had reached more than $8.
The drop in user activity in EOS could be linked to the EIDOS airdrop
that significantly slowed down the network.

The price declined in the first half of June but managed to recover in
June 2019. EOS reached $8.62. Since February 2019, and for some time,
Liquid Apps had been building a second-layer solution for EOS that ran
on the company’s DAPP token. Liquid Apps’ solution aimed to take some
pressure off the EOS [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/)’s RAM system, which had been bogged
down.

From July 2019 to January 2020, the performance of EOS wasn’t very
lively and joyful. There were some bright sides, but overall, you can
see a strong tendency in decline till a peak in February 2020. The price
of EOS was $5.36 then. Though it didn’t repeat the previous success, it
looked quite good and promising given the [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) of the six months
before. The reason for such good [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) was the general tendency of
growing in the cryptocurrency world due to the rise of Bitcoin.
Moreover, in January 2020, the second version of the platform - EOSIO 2
- was launched.

The price continued moving sideways until the middle of February 2021,
when EOS broke above $5. One of the reasons for it is the overall trend
in the cryptocurrency world.

On the 11th of March, 2021, the PowerUp Model of EOS was shown to the
world. It helped to raise the price of the cryptocurrency by 4.75%
during the first three hours. It opened new possibilities for EOS
holders, such as a chance to earn rewards from the unused tokens, an
opportunity to withdraw tokens easily after the initial 4-day period,
and the ability to maintain full control of the EOS tokens they own.
Fees were lowered as well.

Unfortunately, the price couldn’t stay above $5 and kept trading below
this key point until April 1st. This sudden fall can be explained by the
“boom-and-bust” cycle. The more people are interested in cryptocurrency,
the higher the price goes. When some doubts and disillusionment creep
in, a sudden crush happens.

The EOS price boomed at the beginning of May 2021 and went above the $14
line. The reason was the [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) that its founding company secured 10
billion USD for the launch of a brand new subsidiary called Bullish
Global. EOS skyrocketed on May 11th due to Bullish Global. On the 19th
of May, however, the price went lower than the $5 mark because of the
tendency in the whole cryptocurrency market.

The downtrend continued throughout June. By June 22, the EOS/USD pair
reached $3.066, the lowest point since February 2021. And although most
cryptocurrencies follow the BTC trend, EOS had its own path. In July,
EOS opened with a price of $4.14. However, the overall trend was neutral
and the price was moving sideways until July 20. One significant spike
took place on July 9 when Bullish Global revealed its plans to go public
on the New York Stock Exchange.

A new uptrend started on July 21 from the $3.26 mark. By September 6,
EOS had reached $6.30, almost doubling its value. The strong bullish
trend was caused by the rise of BTC that affects the direction of the
market as a whole. Still, the pair couldn’t stick to those levels. On
September 7, EOS/USD plunged to $4.89. The fall was caused by several
factors. First, BTC declined a lot that day. Second, a drop in EOS's
market cap to 0.24% of the total cryptocurrency market cap could be an
additional trigger. This decline was a vital event for the future price
direction. A new downtrend has begun. EOS/USD fell below $4 again.

Although the bearish trend ended on September 29, the recovery is not
robust. The EOS/USD pair has entrenched near $5. The recovery is mostly
supported by the strength of Bitcoin. From the second half of October to
the beginning of November, the leading cryptocurrency had been updating
its all-time highs. EOS’s falls were also caused by the weakness of BTC.

As for the projection for EOS, the EOS [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) is committed to
promoting the adoption of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) solutions and
plays host to NFT protocols. Although EOS faces strong competition from
Ethereum and Cardano, the company wants to attract development teams.

How high will EOS go after? We can only assume.

### What is the Future of EOS? Is EOS a good investment? Will EOS go up?

Should I invest in EOS? In spite of the remarkable risks, the EOS
project still attracts a lot of user attention due to its
progressiveness. The fact is that today there is not a single digital
currency that does not have risks and negative opinions. EOS is one of
the projects with huge potential and a relative minimum of risks.

Summing up the analysis of the [EOS][2] cryptocurrency project, you may
be surprised by how many dramatic ups and downs it has had during its
[history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/).

Even though EOS stayed relatively stable over the last few years, there
was a time when it fell a full 93%, erasing most of the gains of early
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s. As some experts think, EOS is about to set a new all-time
high. Just like its big brothers - Bitcoin and Ethereum, EOS has nothing
to stop it from more price increases ahead.

EOS may seem a solid investment. Although forecasts vary, analysts
predict EOS to keep rising.

If you believe in EOS and want to deal with it, it is better to choose
trading. Markets are cyclical, so don’t be blind when things turn
bearish.
