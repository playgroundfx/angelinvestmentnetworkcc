Gold bets on Biden. Analysis as of 07.10.2020Dmitri Demidenko

The precious metal is still stormy, but it may decide on its further
moves soon. It’s time to make a trading plan for gold.

## Monthly fundamental forecast for gold

Can one fish in troubled waters? The USD fans don’t think so, and buy
the greenback amid uncertainty around the US presidential election.
However, its opponents believe it’s time to sell dollars: Joe Biden will
win anyway, and once it happens, it will be too late. As a result, the
financial markets are being stormy and US dollar-related pairs are
roller-coasting. Just like gold.

It is believed that the key factors in [XAUUSD][1]’s fluctuations are
the US dollar, US treasuries real yield, [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/) fund flows, and risk
appetite. Gold was traditionally considered to be a safe haven asset,
but [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s’ increased demand for money deprived gold of that status
in 2020.   In spring, the US stock indexes drew the precious metal down
in order to maintain positions in stocks. In autumn, the political
uncertainty makes [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s rush to the USD.

However, gold isn’t the only asset that plays its role of a safe haven
badly in 2020. Treasuries can’t do that either. The potential of the
Fed’s monetary expansion is limited. Even if the central bank resumed
Operation Twist buying long-term bonds, the fall in the bonds yield from
current 0.7% to 0% would be only a 7% insurance against a fall of stocks
in portfolios.  [S&P 500][2] can collapse much deeper. Unsurprisingly,
asset managers chose to increase their cash shares and buy the dollar.

The [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/) supporters believe in the gold’s rally and continue building up
their reserves, but for the rally to happen, the greenback must devalue
and inflation must speed up. Growth in consumer prices will lead to a
drop in the treasuries real yield and give the green light to the
[XAUUSD][1] bulls.

In this regard, gold’s reaction to fiscal stimulus talks is
understandable. The [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of providing a new relief package is
reflationary while the absence of such policies raises deflationary
chances. Trump’s illness and calls for talks between Democrats and
Republicans made gold grow to $1,920 per ounce. Once the talks were
over, the precious metal collapsed.

What’s next? I think the market is tired of Trump, his twitter and
frequent mood swings. First, he called on the OPEC to let oil prices
fall so that gas got cheaper in the USA, and then he forced Saudi Arabia
and Russia into cutting the output so that the US gas and oil industry
could recover. First, he demanded that the Fed should weaken the dollar,
and then he said that a strong dollar is an indicator of the US
economy’s strength.

## Monthly trading plan for gold

Every action of the White House’s current tenant gives rise to
uncertainty, which is favourable to the US dollar. If Trump loses the
election, the [XAUUSD][1]’s bulls will have an advantage. That will also
contribute to selling the USD index. If you believe in Joe Biden, buy
gold at the medium-term targets of $1,970 and $2,015 per ounce.
