Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 07.10.2020Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I suggest entry signals
to trade each cryptocurrency.

The BTCUSD market is forming the final leg of the double zigzag W-X-Y.
The price could be rising in the impulse wave [c], which has just
started developing. I recommend entering purchases.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

 ****

The two-hour BTCUSD price chart displays the final section of the
bullish impulse wave A. After the A finished, there has started the down
corrective wave B. It is likely to complete as a double zigzag, composed
of the sub-waves [W]-[X]-[Y]. There is now developing the linking wave
[X] as a double zigzag. At the time of writing, there have completed the
sub-waves (W) and (X), and the (Y) wave, composed of the sub-waves
W-X-Y, is yet unfolding. The price should be rising in the final impulse
wave [c] of Y to a level of 11315.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 10591.25, TP 11315.00

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

 ****

The XRPUSD market is forming the down zigzag A-B-C. After the down
impulse A completed, the market has started rising in the corrective
wave B. It is unfolding as a simple zigzag[a]-[b]-[c], where the [a]
impulse and the [b] correction have finished. The [c] wave is developing
as an impulse composed of five sub-waves (1)-(2)-(3)-(4)-(5). The Ripple
price should be rising in the final wave (5) towards a level of 0.266.
One could enter purchases in the current situation.

### Trading plan for **[XRPUSD][2]** today:

Buy 0.242, TP 0.266

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

 ****

The ETHUSD market is forming the simple zigzag A-B-C. The first two
parts of this zigzag look complete, the impulse wave A and the B
correction that has completed as a triple zigzag. There is now forming
the beginning of the C impulse. The impulse wave [2] has finished. Next,
the price has started rising in the corrective wave [2]. Correction [2]
is a simple zigzag (A)-(B)-(C). The impulse c of (B) should finish soon,
and the price will resume growing in the impulse wave (C) to a level of
374.61.

### Trading plan  **[ETHUSD][3] **today:

Buy 335.48, TP 374.61
