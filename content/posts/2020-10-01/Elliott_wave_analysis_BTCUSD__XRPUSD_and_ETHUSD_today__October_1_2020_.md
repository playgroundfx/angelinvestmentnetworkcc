Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 01.10.2020Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I suggest entry signals
to trade each cryptocurrency.

Cryptocurrency pairs continue forming downtrends. It is relevant to
enter sell trades for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ripple.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

 ****

In the two-hour timeframe, there completed the impulse wave A that is
the beginning of the bullish zigzag currently forming. There is forming
the down corrective wave as a double zigzag [W]-[X]-[Y]. The bear wave
[W] and the linking wave [X] have completed. There is now unfolding the
final zigzag [Y]. The first two legs, the sub-waves (A) and (B) look
complete. Therefore, the market should be going down to the level below
the previous low made by wave (A), which is below 10107.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Sell 10805.50, TP 10107.00

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

 ****

There is now forming the final corrective wave (Y) that is an element of
the double zigzag (W)-(X)-(Y). In the most recent chart section, there
have completed sub-waves A and B. A is an impulse, B is a zigzag. In the
near future, the market should be declining in the new impulse wave

 ****

There is now forming the simple down zigzag that has started forming
after the large wave (Y) completed. After the bear impulse wave A
finished, there has formed the bullish correction B that is a triple
zigzag. There is now unfolding the final impulse wave. The first two
legs, sub-waves [1] and [2] have finished within the impulse. Therefore
the price should be declining in the impulse wave [3] to a level below
311.21, which is the previous low.
