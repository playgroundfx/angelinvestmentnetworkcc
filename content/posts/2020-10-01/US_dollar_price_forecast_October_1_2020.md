A guiding light for dollar. Forecast as of 01.10.2020Dmitri Demidenko

The Japanese yen was replaced by the Chinese yuan as a currency followed
by dollar pairs, which signals the stability of the [EURUSD][1] uptrend.
Let us analyze the long-term euro trend and make up a [EURUSD][1]
trading plan for half a year.

## Fundamental US dollar forecast for half a year

Markets need guides. At the end of the twentieth century, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s were
following the yen to anticipate the dollar rates versus the Deutsche
mark, the British pound, or the Swiss franc. Nowadays, the yuan is going
to play the role of the Japanese yen. The third quarter has been the
best for the [USDCNH][2] bears since 2008, while the USD index has had
the worst results since September 2017. The correlation between these
two assets should strengthen in the next few years, and there are
several reasons for this.

In the 1980s and 1990s, Japan was the second-largest economy in the
world, and the US had the largest deficit in trade with Japan. If the
[USDJPY][3] was falling, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s understood that the US trade deficit
couldn’t be funded at the exchange rate prevailing at the time. It
caused the greenback to weaken, making US assets more attractive for
foreign [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s. If so, the greenback should have been falling not
only versus the yen but also versus other world’s major currencies. The
importance of the Japanese yen proves that the interventions after
signing the Plaza Accord agreement were carried out in the [USDJPY][3]
pair.

At present, the second-largest economy in the world is China. The US has
the biggest trade deficit with China. The past mechanisms could have
worked out earlier but for the strict yuan fixing by the PBOC. In 2015
the restriction was eased and the result was immediate. The trade war
and the [USDCNH][2] sent the [EURUSD][1] down in 2018-2019.

I am sure the yuan will continue rising. Some of my previous [trading
recommendations][4] in the Forex blog worked out. Divergence in economic
expansion and monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) are the key drivers for the Forex rates.
The pandemic only increased their influence on the foreign exchange
market. The recent data on China’s PMI signal that the Chinese economy
is strong, unlike the US growth.

The exhaustion of the US fiscal stimulus and the inability of the
Congress to provide a new financial aid package (the project of $2.2
trillion is not likely to be accepted by the Senate), the difficult
epidemiological situation in the US, and the Fed’s ultra-easy monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) suggest a bearish outlook for the greenback. The USD bulls are
now going ahead amid the uncertainty resulting from the upcoming US
presidential election. However, the rally of the US stock indexes
suggests that the [EURUSD][1] bears are weak. Even Christine Lagarde’s
words that the ECB is to follow the Fed’s example do not support the
euro bears. The European Central Bank is to consider the possibility of
average inflation targeting.

### [EURUSD][1] trading plan for half a year

I do not think the euro bears can break the uptrend. They may succeed if
the second COVID-19 wave is more severe and the euro-area economies are
locked down again. Unless it is so, the [EURUSD][1] price could reach
1.21 and 1.23 in three and six months. The long-term trading idea is to
buy the euro.
