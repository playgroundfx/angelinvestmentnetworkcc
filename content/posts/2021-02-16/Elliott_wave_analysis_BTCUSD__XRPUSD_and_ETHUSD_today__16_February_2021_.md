Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 16.02.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

The BTCUSD market must be finishing a small bullish impulse 5; the
ETHUSD and the XRPUSD should slightly decline in the short term.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

The BTCUSD market is forming the upward impulse wave. There is unfolding
the final leg of the impulse, where, following the end of the corrective
wave 4, the market has started developing the impulse wave 5. There is
developing the bullish wave [3] as a five-wave impulse. Wave [3] should
soon finish, and the BTCUSD pair will go down in the impulse wave (2),
which is the beginning of the bearish correction [4]. The price could
run down to a level below the previous low at 45800.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Sell 49512.50 TP 45800.00

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

The market is now forming the down zigzag [A]-[B]-[C]. The impulse wave
[A] has completed. There is developing the upward corrective wave [B] as
a triple zigzag. The first three elements of this pattern have
completed, and the linking wave (xx) should finish soon. This linking
wave is also a triple zigzag, which will be concluded by the sub-wave z.
The market should be declining in wave z to a level of 0.504, marked by
wave y. Next, the price should start growing in wave (z).

### Trading plan for **[XRPUSD][2]** today:

Sell 0.572, TP 0.504

## Elliott wave Ethereum analysis

The ETHUSD market continues forming the final leg of the global impulse
wave. There is developing wave 5 as an impulse. The sub-waves
[i]-[ii]-[iii] have completed, and there is unfolding the bearish
correction [iv] as a triple zigzag (w)-(x)-(y). After the linking wave
(x) finishes, the market should be declining in the final wave (y),
which could complete at the low of 1652.00.

### Trading plan for  **[ETHUSD][3] **today:

Sell 1819.77, TP 1652.00
