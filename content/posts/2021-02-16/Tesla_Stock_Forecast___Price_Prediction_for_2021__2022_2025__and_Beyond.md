Tesla Stock Price Prediction: 2021 & BeyondJana Kane

Tesla stock (NASDAQ: [TSLA][1]) has been on fire for a long time. Its
share price rose by more than 600% since early 2020, making Elon Musk
the richest person in the world. Bill Selesky (Senior Research Analyst
at Argus Research) predicts the stock will rise above $1,000 this year.
He considers it a share worth buying, even at the current price ($816 at
the time of writing: February 14, 2021). According to Selesky, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s
can still achieve 20% returns and more. The Tesla Motors stock value is
included on major US indices, such as NASDAQ and the S&P 500 Index.

[Tesla][2] is the undisputed leader in electric vehicles (EVs) anyway.
It remains to be seen whether this will still be the case in the coming
years in a market where many other brands are also strongly producing
their own EVs. One thing is certain: electric cars are the future and a
fast-growing segment of car sales, which is evident from the Tesla share
forecast.

The article covers the following subjects:

The ticker symbol “TSLA” stock is slated to become the most talked-about
stock of 2021 and perhaps also in 2022. TSLA is probably the most
pressed symbol on any investment platform. The Tesla share price
forecast has risen so much that some [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are afraid of heights. Is
this right? Or are they just missing an opportunity out of a thousand?
We’ll take a look at it in this Tesla stock price prediction and
financial outlook.

## A Short History of Tesla

Tesla first went public in 2010, offering its 13.3 million [Tesla
shares][2] for just $17 per share. Now here's the fact; at the time of
writing this post (February 14, 2021), Tesla's stock is valued at over
$800! This represents an increase of about 50x in a short period of time
of just 10 years! With a market cap of approximately $800 billion, there
is no doubt that Tesla is the world's largest automaker by value, even
outperforming giant premium brands such as Toyota and General Motors.

While the entire world suffered from the economic effects of COVID-19,
Tesla reported a sharp 71% increase in vehicle production in the fourth
quarter compared to the same quarter last year. Most people thought
Tesla's goal of producing 500,000 vehicles by 2020 was nearly
impossible. The California carmaker almost managed to reach its target
by producing 499,647 cars by 2020.

## Tesla Stock Price Today

The [all-time high][3] Tesla stock closing price was $883.09 on January
26, 2021. The current price of Tesla stock (NASDAQ: [TSLA][1]) is
$796.30. This is an interactive value, so you can later refer to this
article to learn the Tesla price tomorrow.

Below is a [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) timeline chart from the NASDAQ (the last close was on
February 12, 2021), which shows the stock trading volume, as well as the
last five real-time trades of the Tesla stock. This chart is presented
as an example trading day on NASDAQ.

## Tesla Stock Forecast: Price Predictions by Experts

It is important to note that Selesky is not the only analyst with a
target price above $1,000. Colin Rusch, an analyst at Oppenheimer, has a
price target of $1,036 in 2021, making him the most optimistic of all
his Wall Street colleagues. We'll get back to him a bit later.

Some even think that these predictions may ultimately be conservative.
There were many doubts when Tesla announced last year that it wanted to
deliver half a million vehicles. By 2020, the company had produced
509,727 vehicles and delivered 499,550. It just barely missed its
somewhat daring prognosis.

In conjunction with its recent earnings report, Tesla communicated the
following: “Over the next few years, we expect an average annual growth
of 50% in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of vehicle delivery. In some years, we can grow faster,
which is expected to be the case in 2021.” If that forecast gets even
close to reality, the Tesla stock forecast could go much higher.

No share [rose in value][4] as much in 2020 as Tesla's did. CEO Elon R.
Musk did not do any harm. Thanks to his Tesla shares, he can now call
himself the richest man in the world. The innovator will only get richer
this year, if we are to believe the expectations and analyst
recommendations of Colin Rusch of investment bank Oppenheimer, Rusch
doubles his price target for Tesla to $1,036.

In a statement, the analyst explains why he has doubled his price target
estimate. He thinks Tesla has a head start when it comes to
manufacturing efficiency and commercializing self-driving cars. This
does not mean that the competition is standing still: the American
General Motors, among others, has big plans to release new electric
models.

By the way, Colin Rusch is not just any Tesla superfan: he is one of
Wall Street's highest-ranked analysts. Rusch is ranked 12th out of 7,243
analysts on [TipRanks][5]. This score is based on a success rate of 64%
and an average return of 75%.

## TSLA Technical Analysis

Below is a technical analysis of [Tesla Inc.'s stock, ][2]showing the
trend of the past 6 months. The chart immediately indicates how strong
the trend is. As long as we don't see a sharp decline accompanied by
increased volume, there is no reason why the current trend should
reverse. Technically, the Tesla stock is still bullish. What are the
technical targets? When a stock hits a new all-time high, you cannot
rely on resistance levels.

Therefore, you can use psychological levels on the one hand. A first
technical goal is the $1,000 psychological level. If the price rises
even further, $1,250, $1,500, $1,750 and $2,000 are the next
psychological levels that sellers are waiting for. Another method to
determine the current price targets through technical analysis is
analyzing the Fibonacci extensions. The Tesla stock rating is now facing
resistance to the 161.8% Fibonacci extension. If the upward trend
continues, the next technical price target is via the 261.8% Fibonacci
extension. This equates to a value of 1,300 USD per Tesla share. A bull
case.

If you want to get an idea of where market participants think the Tesla
stock price will go, it would be wise to look at the Tesla projected
growth and the open interest. A certain option's open interest indicates
how many [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) are active in the relevant strike price and expiration
date. The higher the open interest is, the higher interest market
participants have in the share at the relevant strike price.

which is +26%. Tesla will start 2028 at $9,988, then soar to $10,198
within the first half of the year, and finish 2028 at $10,417. This is
about +1,176% from today.

could be worth $1.5 trillion by 2030.

## How Has the Price of Tesla stock Changed Over Time?

In order for analysts to make a realistic and reliable Tesla stock
prediction, it's essential to look back at how the commodity performed
during the previous years of its existence. Below is a NASDAQ chart that
shows how the Tesla stock value has changed since the company was
founded. Notice the major price explosion around 2020!

## Factors That Can Affect the Tesla Stock Price

The price of a share mainly depends on the attitude of the [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s to
the issuing company. Among the most important factors that will
influence a stock's price are expectations about the company's results.
The demand for Tesla shares on the stock exchange depends on the
analysts' predictions about the company's profit (or loss).

A company can also increase its value in the market through the assets
it owns. Just think of, for example, a patent, a real estate portfolio,
a sales exclusivity. Innovation also plays an important role in the
success of a company.

Stock market predictions and prices are also influenced by the level and
expected evolution of interest rates. After all, at low interest rates,
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s will dare to take more risks to obtain higher returns and find
their way to the stock exchange more easily.

The sector in which a company operates is also a factor that can cause
its price to fluctuate. A healthy company in a sector in difficulty will
be negatively impacted by the image of the sector on the market. We are
thinking here of the financial values ​​that have become much less
credible after the crisis in 2008. And the value of Tesla shares on the
stock exchange can also rise or fall due to a radical change that the
sector is experiencing. A new product that is released or new habits
that consumers adopt are factors that can determine the evolution of a
share's value. Another great opportunity is the consolidation of a
sector. A company that acquires other companies in the same sector can
establish itself as a market leader and occupy a dominant position
there.

In a broader context, the general evolution of the markets can increase
or decrease the value of a security. In gloomy markets, as we have known
them during the financial crises of 2008 and 2011, even healthy and
promising values ​​were sucked into a downward spiral when there was
fundamentally nothing wrong with them. In periods of euphoria, the
entire market takes part in the increase without being economically
justified.

Major economic and political trends can also trigger panic or calm on
the stock market and sweep an entire market up or down due to favorable
or troubling macroeconomic fundamental occurrences. A country's fiscal,
budgetary and especially monetary measures are more likely to reassure
or worry [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s.

Consumer habits can also play a role in the potential evolution of a
stock price, as with the Tesla stock prediction. Some opportunities are
cyclical. Certain sectors that have had to implement restructuring can
get out of a cycle of less growth due to more consolidation. Other
opportunities are more structural. This is the case, for example, for
companies active in education. As emerging countries transition from a
predominantly agricultural culture to an industrial and service economy,
there is a structural need to improve the educational system. There may
then be a strong demand for these companies on the stock exchange.

Some companies are also more sensitive than others to the evolution of
the currency. A company that derives a large part of its turnover from
exports will experience a rise or fall in the currencies on its
turnover, profitability, and stock market price.

As we can see, the stock market price will therefore depend on internal
factors: balance sheet structure, profitability, earnings expectations,
the share of turnover in exports, capacity to innovate, position in the
market relative to competitors, assets. But this evolution will also
depend on external factors: the political and macroeconomic situation,
as well as the evolution and the perception of the sector in which the
company operates. All these factors must, therefore, be correctly
approached and analyzed by the [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/).

## What Is the Future Price of Tesla Stocks? Are Tesla Stocks a Good
Investment?

[Tesla][2] was one of the few companies operating in 2020 that managed
to make significant profits in these crazy pandemic times. The company's
stock hit a record high just a few days ago, which even led to CEO Elon
Musk becoming the richest man in the world and even surpassing Amazon's
CEO Jeff Bezos! The Palo-Alto, California-based electric vehicle
manufacturer is a huge brand in today's world. The company specializes
in manufacturing "future cars" that do not require gasoline or diesel to
run.

The ride for Tesla, Inc shareholders appears to be getting more
comfortable as the company continues to make a profit and even increase
its earnings quarter after quarter. Tesla has grown into the largest
producer of high-tech cars in the world. Anyone dealing with the
industry in one way or another knows the name of the company. If it
continues like this with Tesla, there is no doubt that its shareholders
will make huge profits in the future. So, what is the Tesla (TSLA) stock
forecast? Below is a Tesla Inc. price prediction chart for 2021:

During the frenzied pandemic times of 2020, it is nearly impossible to
believe that while other companies struggled to stay in the market,
Tesla's stock rose nearly 700%! This means that if you had invested
$10,000 in Tesla in 2019, your investment would have become over 70,000
by 2021! It sounds crazy, right? Well, these numbers are nothing yet.
The company says it plans to increase its production by nearly 50% in
2021.

Such an increase means that shareholders get even more profit from Tesla
shares. The company generated a whopping $31.5 billion in total revenue
in 2020, which was more than enough to push its total value above $800
billion. Having numbers like that means the company has tremendous
potential to take on Apple and Google as it aims to hit $1 trillion very
soon! Buying Tesla stock is now better than ever. If you’re wondering
