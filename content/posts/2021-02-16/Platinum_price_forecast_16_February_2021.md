Platinum: Don’t kick a sleeping dog. Forecast as of 16.02.2021Dmitri
Demidenko

That is the market: victories and fame follow losses. A typical example
is platinum, which has grown by more than 20% in value since the
beginning of 2021. Where will the [XPTUSD][1] in 2021? Let us discuss
this topic and make up a trading plan.

## Fundamental platinum forecast for a year

We all seek what is better, and [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s and produces seek what is
cheaper. Platinum could replace more expensive gold when hedging against
inflation risks and more expensive palladium in the car industry.
Therefore, the [XPTUSD][1] has hit its six-year high. Since the
beginning of the year, the platinum price has been up by 21%,
significantly outperforming other precious metals, which meets
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s' expectations. Remember, [in late 2020][2], I suggested
platinum purchases be one of the best [trading strategies](https://www.fintechee.com/forex-trading-strategies/) in 2021.

### Dynamics of precious metals in 2021

According to Johnson Matthey research, the precious metal market was in
a moderate deficit last year amid a 20% drop in production due to a
lockdown in South Africa and other producing countries and a 22% decline
in global autocatalyst demand. Europe suffered particularly badly. Care
sales in the euro area fell by 40% at the recession peak and recovered
to 20% Y-o-Y by the end of 2020. In 2021, the precious metals market
structure should radically change, which encourages the [XPTUSD][1]
bulls.

Furthermore, substantial price spreads between gold and platinum have
boosted [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s’ interest in XPT as a cheaper metal. According to the
World Platinum Investment Council, the platinum [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/)s holdings reached
3.9 million ounces at the end of January, up from 3.4 million ounces a
year earlier. According to Johnson Matthey, the market balance and,
accordingly, the platinum prices will largely depend on the demand for
the platinum [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/) products.

An essential driver of the [XPTUSD][1] rally is the platinum’s ability
to replace gold in investments and palladium in the production of
automotive catalysts for gasoline engines. Both assets of the platinum
group could be pressed by the advent of the electric car era. However,
if hydrogen fuel technology that uses platinum becomes widespread, it
will drive up the XPT prices even higher. Even it doesn’t occur now, but
a few years later, it doesn’t matter. Expectations drive markets.

Massive fiscal stimulus, ultra-easy monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), the growing chance
of the inflation rise, and the US dollar’s weakness create a favorable
environment for the gold price rise. However, the [XAUUSD][3] is not
growing. One of the reasons is that gold is an overbought asset. In
2020, the XAUUSD was 24% up. Investors are likely to realize this fact
and are ow interested in other precious metals. The most appealing is
platinum; it looks like a dog, who was kicked and is now picked.

### Platinum trading plan for a year

Platinum could repeat the gold’s success, which performed the best rise
in 2020 over the past decade. The platinum price has already reached the
target at $1330, defined in [December][4] and [January][5]; it is at the
beginning of the commodity market super-cycle. If so, it is time to
revise the expected profit for the [XPTUSD][1] longs up to $1420 per
ounce for 2021. I recommend holding and adding up to long positions on
the corrections.
