Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 24.12.2020Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I suggest entry signals
to trade each cryptocurrency.

Ethereum is forming a bearish correction which takes the form of a
complex structure. It is a triple zigzag. The second linking wave XX is
expected to form in the near future.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

 ****

The chart shows the structure of the uptrend. It is an impulse. Not so
long ago, the market formed a corrective wave (4), which took the form
of an A-B-C zigzag. Currently, we see the development of an upward
impulse wave (5), to be precise, its middle part - impulse 3.
Apparently, a horizontal correction [4] is being formed, which is a flat
(a)-(b)-(c). In the near future, sub-wave (c) will be completed. After
that the price will rise in the final wave (5) towards the level of
26000.00.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 22933.50 TP 26000.00

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

 ****

A downward wave (W), which is a triple zigzag W-X-Y-XX-Z, is seen
distinctly in the chart. It is assumed that this zigzag is fully
completed, so in the near future, the price may rise in the upward
linking wave (X). Most likely the price will reach the level of 0.498.
At this level, wave (X) will be 50% of wave (W) according to the
Fibonacci lines. Consider opening longs.

### Trading plan for **[XRPUSD][2]** today:

Buy 0.285, TP 0.498

* * *

## Elliott wave Ethereum analysis

 ****

In the last section of the chart, we see a downward corrective wave (4)
developing, it takes the form of a bearish triple zigzag W-X-Y-XX-Z.
Apparently, the first three parts of this structure have already been
completed. In the short term, a rise to the level of 609.25 is possible
in wave XX, at which point it will be 50% of a downward wave (Y). The
price will then begin to go down in the final actionary wave (Z), as
shown in the chart.

### Trading plan for  **[ETHUSD][3] **today:

Buy 581.34, TP 609.25
