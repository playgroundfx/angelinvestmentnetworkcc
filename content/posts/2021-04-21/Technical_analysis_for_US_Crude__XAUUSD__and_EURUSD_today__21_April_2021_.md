Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 21.04.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

Yesterday, the short-term oil trend reversed down by breaking out the
support level of 62.84.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

Yesterday, the short-term oil trend reversed down by breaking out the
support level of 62.84. The Additional Zone 63.07 - 62.94 was also
broken out. As a result, the price reached the Intermediary Zone 61.80 -
61.54.

Now traders' reaction can be seen: the price rises in the Margin Zone.
The growth target is a test of the mirror level of 62.84. It is possible
to enter new WTI oil sales with the target of 61.80 in the
beforementioned mirror level.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

Sell from the level of 62.84. TakeProfit: 61.80. StopLoss: 63.19.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

Gold has worked out the priority bullish pattern, reaching the
resistance level of 1788. Purchases in the Intermediary Zone 1765 - 1762
should be stopped.

The breakout of level 1788 and price consolidation higher are required
for the further growth of gold prices. Then the target will be Gold Zone
2 1805 - 1802. The trend key support is shifting to the level of 1768.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

Watch the market.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

This week, the euro traders tried to break out the Target Zone 2 1.2040
- 1.2024 but failed. Now the price is falling and breaking out the
Additional Zone 1.2036 - 1.2031. The probable target of the fall is a
test of the short-term uptrend's border 1.1992 - 1.1983.

After testing the Intermediary Zone 1.1992 - 1.1983, start looking for
new purchases according to the pattern. The target will be level 1.2072.
It will be also relevant to buy the euro if the price goes back to the
Additional Zone and forms a false breakout pattern.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

  1. Buy according to the pattern in Additional Zone 1.2036 - 1.2031. TakeProfit: 1.2072. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. Buy according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 1.1992 - 1.1983. TakeProfit: 1.2072. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.
