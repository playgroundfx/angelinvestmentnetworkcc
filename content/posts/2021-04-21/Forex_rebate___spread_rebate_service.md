Forex rebate: reduce your spread costsOleg Tkachenko

What is Forex rebate, and why does a trader need a rebate service? How
can you reduce your spread costs?

Rebate is similar to the cashback option. It allows a trader to
compensate for a part of the trading costs. In general [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/), it works
like this. A trader registers for free on the rebate service [website](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/website-for-forex-trading/),
follows the affiliate link to the broker's [website](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/website-for-forex-trading/), opens an account,
trades, and pays the spread (markup) to the broker/market.

The broker shares a part of the commission (spread/markup) received from
the trader to the rebate service for the clients it attracted. The
rebate service shares a part of the affiliate earnings with the trader.
Everybody is happy.

Read on this article, and you will know how rebate service works, what
benefits to provides to the trader and the broker, and how you can
receive such compensation. In the end, I will explain a real example of
registering and connecting a trading account to a rebate service.

The article covers the following subjects:

Read a step-by-step guide to how you can compensate for a part of the
spread you pay.

## What is rebate, and how does a trader benefit from it?

### A detailed instruction

Did you know that the trading costs can be partially reduced? I mean
that you can get back some of the money you pay to the broker as the
spread (markup). Moreover, it is entirely free for a trader. And if
there is such an opportunity, why not use it?

You will learn from this overview:

  * What spread rebate, its advantages, and risks for a trader.
  * The way you can rebate a part of the spread costs and how much you can actually return (practical calculations).
  * Detailed instruction on how you open an account via a rebate service: a step-by-step guide with a real example.

### Rebate: the way to save your money

Rebate is a [return of a part of the spread][1] paid to the broker. This
is quite a general definition, which I want to explain. Spread is the
difference between the buy and the sell price of an asset. In the case
of the STP or ECN order processing model, it is formed by the liquidity
provider or the market state.

Using the rebate, the trader gets back only that part of the spread that
is the broker's commission (markup, which is a kind of broker's margin
on the spread).

Rebate is paid regardless of whether the trade generates a profit or a
loss. The frequency of payments is different, depending on the
conditions offered by the broker/rebate service (site). It can be
accrued [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) (on the closed trading day), weekly, monthly. The
calculation formula is also different, according to the trading account
type.

For example, it could be a percentage of the spread or a fixed sum for
each traded lot. Some brokers offer different rebate bonuses according
to the trading turnover. For example, you get back some amount of the
money spent if your trade turnover is less than 10 lots per month. If
you trade more than 10 lots in a month, you can rebate more money.

### Rebate can be provided by:

  * Directly by the broker. It is similar to a cashback service, and you can find the information in the section on promotional and bonus programs.
  * Another resource, like an independent rebate service, which cooperates with many brokers.

However, you can’t simultaneously participate in the rebate program
provided by your broker and register an account through a rebate site.
You will have to choose between these two [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/), and each of them has
its advantages.

Most commonly, you can rebate more of your costs by operating directly
with the broker. That is because there is no additional intermediary in
the affiliate chain, so you do not have to share your earnings. The
advantages of a rebate service:

  * The division of the trader’s cash flows. In the first case (working only with the broker), the trader’s funds (the deposit and the rebate) are controlled by the broker. In the second case, the rebate is accumulated on the account opened on the rebate site.

If the broker is a kitchen, and the trader has problems with the money
withdrawal, he/she can at least withdraw the rebate. It is small
comfort, but still.

  * The rebate site serves as a consolidation platform. The rebate service can cooperate with dozens of brokers that post both trading and rebate conditions on the platform. That is, all trading conditions are collected here, and a trader only needs to analyze them instead of surfing dozens of [website](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/website-for-forex-trading/)s.

On the other hand, is this information always relevant and up to date on
such a platform? Besides, the trader, in this case, can’t see other
advantages or disadvantages of a particular broker.

  * Rebate service works as a [ranking](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/crypto-exchange-ranking/) and analytical platform. It means such a platform ranks brokers with the best trading conditions, best rebate offers.

The brokers’ rating is based on the traders ‘ comments. Are those
ratings objective? It is a rhetorical question.

  * Compensation fund. Some rebate services declare a compensation fund that insures the trader against the possible loss of investment. However, the source of such a fund is not specified. I, for example, haven’t heard anything about the payments provided by such funds.
  * Some rebate services provide free legal support. The owners of such platforms promise to help in every possible way and defend the trader’s interests if there is a conflict with the broker.

At first, it seems that it is more beneficial to participate in a spread
rebate program of a rebate service. The rebate sites seem suitable for
all [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s. However, most of the stated advantages are only in
theory.

## How do rebate sites work?

In general, the cooperation model of the rebate service, the broker, and
the trader works like this:

  * Trader registers a profile on the rebate site. The profile serves for the further monitoring of the rebate statistics on all accounts. Some rebate platforms accrue money to the account opened together with the profile (Personal profile balance). The trader can withdraw the money or transfer it to the broker's trading account. Cash is credited directly to the trading account via the link through the ID code on other platforms.
  * The trader follows the affiliate link to the broker’s [website](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/website-for-forex-trading/), which cooperates with the rebate platform. The client opens a real trading account, goes through the verification, and starts trading.
  * In accordance with the rebate offer, the trader returns a part of the spread costs. How much money is compensated, where and how - it is specified in offer conditions.

How much money can you rebate? Forex brokers offer different conditions.
The rebate conditions may also differ for separate [Forex trading](https://www.fintechee.com/forex-trading-strategies/)
accounts with the same broker. I will give two examples.

 **Example 1.** Broker A offers compensation for 70% of the spread on
the Classic account, 80% of which is received by the trader. In other
words, the broker pays 70% of the spread to the rebate service, 80% of
this amount goes to the trader's account (these conditions are usually
indicated on the rebate [website](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/website-for-forex-trading/)). The rebate is calculated in the
following way:

  * The trader trades 0.25 lots a day. For 20 working days of the month, the turnover will be 5 lots.
  * For the [EURUSD][2] pair with 1 lot of 100,000 units, the pip price will be $10 (for 4-digit quotes!).
  * The spread starts from 2 pips (it is the minimum value).

The trader’s spread costs for 20 days will be: 5 * 10 * 2 = $100. This
is the amount the trader would pay working directly with the broker. 70
* 0.8 = $56 – the rebate amount. The trader’s actual transaction cost
will be $44.

 **Example 2.** Broker B offers to rebate $8 for each traded lot on the
Classic account. The trader receives 80% of the rebate. Here, the
calculation formula is even simpler.

Traders costs for the turnover of 5 lots is $100 (see in the previous
example). The rebate amount is $40 (5*8). The trader receives $32
(40*0.8). The actual trading costs are $68.

The examples are approximate. And you don’t have to calculate everything
manually. However, when you choose the rebate service or the broker on
the rebate site, you should study at least reference figures to compare
different offers.

Almost all rebate sites have calculators. However, they do not consider
floating spreads. They take into account the minimum fixed spread. That
will do for comparison, but actual rebate amounts won’t be the same as
the figures produced by online instant cash calculators.

### Benefits of the rebate for the broker and the trader

There is a natural question. Why should a broker share the commission
with the trader or with the rebate service? However, forex rebates work
to the broker’s advantage as well.

 **Advantages of the rebate for the broker:**

  *  **Marketing tool.** Human psychology works so that all sorts of promotions and loyalty programs work more effectively than just a price reduction (in this case, the spread). In other words, it is not enough just to reduce the spread; you also need to offer the trader extra benefits [introducing broker](https://www.fintechee.com/services/introducing-broker/) so that he/she feels special.
  *  **Encouragement to trade more.** It is another psychological aspect that encourages the trader to increase volumes. The more traders trade, the more they reduce the costs, and the profits increase as a result. Also, using the rebate forex, the broker can stimulate traders to work with less popular or higher risk assets by offering them a higher compensation level.
  *  **Outsourcing.** Each broker is interested in attracting as many active traders as possible. Affiliate programs and rebates are those business model tools that are outsourced. Intermediaries are engaged in attraction and marketing, bringing traders, while brokers share their commission with them.

 **Advantages of the rebate for a trader**

You do not pay any commissions or membership fees. You need a little
money to control the rebate service account, in all the other [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/), the
trader only benefits.

  1.  **It saves up money.**   Of course, trading involves substantial risk. However, in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of cash rebates, a trader loses nothing. The registration on a rebate site is free.
  2.  **It helps you realize the strategy that could be losing without a rebate.** I mean [trading strategies](https://www.fintechee.com/forex-trading-strategies/) where the spread makes up a significant share of trading costs:
    * Scalping. For example, if the spread is two points, the expected profit will be at least three points. If you rebate 50%, you will be able to lower the limit.
    * Algorithmic trading with high-frequency strategies, including grid trading.
    * Trading exotic currency pairs, featuring high spreads because of low liquidity.
  3.  **Psychological support.** A loss can be a great stress for many traders. The rebate, which is also accrued on losing trades (so, it reduces the loss), is a sort of consolation prize.

 **How to choose a rebate service (selection parameters):**

  *  **The required broker is among the service partners.** A potential trader can choose a broker from the rebate service monitoring. However, I would recommend starting from the opposite side. The spread rebate is not the main criterion for choosing a broker.

Therefore, first, decide who you are ready to work with and only then
look for a company in the list of rebate services. It is especially
acute for active traders. If your broker is not on the list of rebate
service partners, it doesn’t mean that your broker will yield you a loss
and is not suitable.

  *  **Rebate conditions.** A common mistake is to think the greater is the compensation amount, the better. On the one hand, a large rebate amount may indicate that the rebate service has so many clients that it can afford to lose most of its earnings.

On the other hand, it can be a [fraud](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/cryptocurrency-fraud/) to attract potential traders to a
broker in the rebate site [ranking](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/crypto-exchange-ranking/). So, you should also note if you can
receive the rebate [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) – already in a day, you will understand if the
figures are real and it is a win ratio.

  *  **The fact of payments.** If you want to refer to the comments, you should use only specialized forums. It is even more reliable to check the payments yourself, on your experience with a small amount of money.
  *  **Follow your interests and go with your gut feeling.**

Rebate services that work with LiteForex are FxCash, Traders Union,
Premium Trading, Globe Gain. You can rebate a part of costs through side
services and participation in a referral system with your broker.
Basically, a rebate service with your broker works similarly, but you
adjust the cashback on the broker’s [website](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/website-for-forex-trading/). You can read more

## Rebate FAQs

What risks does a trader bear when working with a broker using an
affiliate link through a rebate service?

First of all, I will repeat again that the trader does not bear
financial risks. You do not have to pay any commissions or fees. In the
worst case, you won’t get the compensation, but you won’t lose what you
already have. But still, there are some risks:

  * The risk of wasting time. You study the [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of compensation, go through verification, and in the end, get nothing.
  * Reputation risk. Verification involves the transfer of personal data to the service. From a security point of view, this is reasonable, but servers are sometimes hacked. And there are other ways of getting the trader's personal data to third parties. 

The more intermediaries are engaged, the greater the risk that your
personal data could be stolen.

  * The risk of getting carried away with excitement, the pursuit of rebate/cashback, forgetting about risk management. 

Of course, you should have different passwords for the personal profiles
with a broker and a rebate service.

## From theory to practice: [how to](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-trading-how-to/) open a LiteForex account through the
FxCash rebate service

I chose this rebate service for several reasons: LiteForex is a FxCash
partner. FxCash is a popular rebate service.

 **To open an account with LiteForex through the FxCash rebate service,
you need to go through the following steps:**

 **Step 1.** Sign in on the FxCash main page (the "Sign Up" button).
Alternatively, you can choose the Brokers item in the top menu and find
LiteForex. In addition to the broker's current [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) and spread return
conditions, there is a sign-up button.

You can learn more about the rebate provided by LiteForex and FxCash
[here][4].

 **Step 2.** Enter your Email and phone number on the registration page.
You will receive an SMS code to your phone number. Enter the code, and
you will receive a letter to your email with a link to follow and
confirm your account activation. You can also restore your forgotten
password via email.

 **Step 3.** Find LiteForex on the left menu and follow the link.

Open a real trading account on the LiteForex [website](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/website-for-forex-trading/). Next, you should
go through the verification both with the LiteForex, and the FxCash. I
won’t describe the procedure here, you should simply follow the
instructions.

 **Step 4.** Enter the number of the trading account opened with the
LiteForex in the “Trading accounts” section.

That’s it. Now your LiteForex trading account is attached to the rebate
service personal profile. You will receive the rebate to your trading
account if you actively trade.

You can add any number of accounts; the frequency of payments depends on
each account’s conditions ([daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/), rebate, weekly, monthly). You withdraw
the money through payment systems. There is a [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) withdrawal limit if
you are not verified.

## Conclusion.

Rebate is an opportunity for a trader to partially compensate for
trading costs. You shouldn’t expect to rebate large funds, but partial
compensation of costs is better than nothing. I don’t risk anything when
you sign up on a rebate [website](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/website-for-forex-trading/).

The only dilemma is which rebate to select: rebate from the broker or
from a different service. If you still have questions or need help with
calculation/choosing a service, write in the comments!
