Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 21.04.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

All three cryptocurrencies covered in the article are forming zigzag-
shaped patterns. Let us study each cryptocurrency in more detail.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

The BTCUSD market continues forming a downward double zigzag W-X-Y. The
first wave W has completed as a bearish triple zigzag. There is now
unfolding the upward linking wave X, which looks like a double zigzag.
The sub-waves [W] and [X] have finished now, and wave [Y] has just
started developing. The price should be following the zigzag-shaped
pattern composed of the sub-waves (A)-(B)-(C), as it is outlined in the
chart. Wave X should finish at a level of 61200.00.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 56004.50, TP 61200.00

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

The XRPUSD market is forming the corrective down wave [2], which could
complete as a standard zigzag. Wave (A) must have finished as a leading
diagonal. Next, the market turned up and started rising in the double
zigzag (B). There is unfolding the initial part of the Y wave, which is
a bullish zigzag [A]-[B]-[C]. The Y wave could end at a level of 1.770.
An approximate trajectory of the Ripple future price movement is
outlined in the chart.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] today:

Buy 1.441, TP 1.770

## Elliott wave Ethereum analysis

The ETHUSD market, like other major cryptocurrencies, is forming a
descending zigzag-shaped pattern. There is developing the double zigzag
(W)-(X)-(Y). The first motive wave (W) has finished, as well as the
first two sub-waves of the linking wave (X), which is unfolding as a
double zigzag W-X-Y. The bullish impulse wave [A] has completed within
the final wave Y. The price could go down a little in the corrective
wave [B] in the near future. Next, the market will resume growing in the
[C] impulse to a level of 2400.00.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Buy 2320.12, TP 2400.00
