Euro is to catch an impulse. Forecast as of 21.04.2021Dmitri Demidenko

The US economic forecasts are so high that they will hardly be exceeded.
In Europe, the situation is opposite. How will the [EURUSD][1] react?
Let us discuss the Forex outlook and make up a trading plan.

## Weekly euro fundamental forecast

Financial markets strongly depend on who rules the US economy. In the
Donald Trump era, with its trade wars, accusations against the Fed, and
verbal interventions, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s were worried rather than bored. With Joe
Biden in power, markets return to a normal state when exchange rates are
determined by the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of central banks, which is reflected
by bond yields.

The primary driver of the [EURUSD][1] rally in April has become the
narrowing gap between the US and Germany’s government bond yields. The
Treasury yields are declining, as the rise in March didn’t force the Fed
to take active steps. Investors tested the Fed for strength, and the
central bank didn’t feature any reaction, discouraging the Treasury
bears. Now the markets are coming to understand that a significant part
of the positive has already been priced. That is why the US strong
economic data don’t result in the government bond yields growth, and the
greenback doesn’t strengthen.

The expectations for the US economic performance are so high that they
are difficult to meet. Markets need new impulses to continue the rally,
and most often, they are provided by positive economic surprises. The
euro-area economic situation is opposite. The expectations are low and
easy to be exceeded. The [EURUSD][1] is about to catch a new impulse to
go up. Speculators understand this fact, as they have resumed entering
the USD shorts by mid-April.

### Dynamics of USD speculative positions

The growth in German bond yields is due not only to the acceleration of
vaccinations in the EU and the transition of [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) sentiment from
total euro-pessimism to ordinary euro-pessimism but also the growing
risks of a split in the Governing Council. If Christine Lagarde doesn’t
prove the central bank's dovish stance at the upcoming ECB meeting, the
[EURUSD][1] bears can well be discouraged. Even a decrease in weekly
purchases under the PEPP will be a reason to buy the euro.

Thus, a decline in the Treasury yields presses down the dollar while the
euro acquires new impulse amid the low economic forecasts. The
[EURUSD][1] further trend should be up, but the rally won’t be easy.
Information about a record COVID-19 death rate in India has halted the
Treasury yields decline, pressing down the US stock indexes and
supporting the greenback. After all, the pandemic has not yet ended, and
the markets behave as if it was already over. Isn’t it too early?

### Weekly [EURUSD][1] trading plan

In my opinion, the return of the investment ideas that dominated Forex
at the end of 2020 suggests a positive outlook for the [EURUSD][1]. It
is relevant to buy the pair on the corrections. If the price fails to
test the supports at 1.199 and 1.1935, one could enter long trades.
