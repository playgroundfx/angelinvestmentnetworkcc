Oil is on a lucky streak. Forecast as of 21.04.2021Dmitri Demidenko

Despite outbreaks of the pandemic in some parts of the world, the
growing global demand should allow the [Brent][1] and the [WTI][2] oil
prices to reach new highs. In such a situation, the main thing is not to
miss the entry point to the position. Let us discuss the Forex outlook
and make up a trading plan

## Quarterly oil fundamental forecast

The oil market got a deja vu. COVID-19 cases are on the rise, with
India's [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) coronavirus deaths hitting all-time highs, New Delhi
imposing new restrictions while refineries are closing, threatening to
push the country's oil demand down to their lowest levels since 1990.
[Brent][1] and [WTI][2] prices react to negative [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) from Southeast
Asia by falling, and traders recall that a year has passed since the
moment when futures fell below zero.

The situation in the oil market is now much better than it was in April
2020. India is a major player, but developments in other regions of the
world are positively affecting [Brent][1] and [WTI][2] bulls. According
to Bloomberg calculations, China's oil demand in the first quarter
increased by 19% to 13.22 million BPD. Oil refining in March increased
by 20% to a near-record 14.14 million BPD. Local traffic and production
activity have not only returned to normal but have surpassed pre-
coronavirus levels, contributing to the recovery of global oil demand.

In the United States, the vaccination process is in full swing. Almost
64% of Americans have received at least one dose. In Europe, the
vaccination campaign is accelerating. Goldman Sachs expects that 37% of
citizens of the largest EU economies will receive doses by the end of
May, and by the end of June, this figure will increase to 54%. Due to
lockdowns, the number of COVID-19 cases in Europe is decreasing. India
is currently one of the outsiders in the fight against the pandemic, and
the drop of [Brent][1] and [WTI][2] prices in response to negative [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/)
from this country should be considered as a correction.

This is confirmed by the return of commercial oil reserves in the OECD
countries to the five-year averages. Earlier, the IEA noted that the gap
between the abovementioned countries narrowed from a July peak of 249
million barrels to 57 million barrels in February. According to
Citigroup, the gap is now completely closed.

The global economy's rapid growth during the rest of the year will
positively impact global oil demand. According to the major oil trader
Vitol, the demand will grow by 7-8 million BPD by the end of 2022
compared to current levels, while the [WTI][2] price will rise to $70-73
per barrel in the third quarter of 2021.

It is impossible to compare the current situation with last year in
[terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of global supply. In April 2020, an oil war was going on between
Russia and Saudi Arabia. Now both Moscow and Riyadh have to act in the
same conditions. Also, the market was in the strongest backwardation
last month, which signals a potential shortage of supplies.

### Quarterly [Brent][1] trading plan

In my opinion, the OPEC+ manages to successfully balance the market,
which, against the background of growing global demand, will help to
recover the [Brent][1] uptrend. I recommend buying Brent when the price
rebounds from the supports at $64.9 and $62.9, or after an update of
April high with targets at $69.8 and $75.5 per barrel.
