USDCHF: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 05.03.2021 –
12.03.2021Alex Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions from corrections above the
level of 0.9042 with a target of 0.9508 – 0.9681.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
0.9042 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of 0.8871
– 0.8760.

 **Analysis:** Presumably, the descending first wave of larger degree
(1) of 5 finished developing on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame, with wave 5 of (1)
formed inside. An ascending correction started developing as wave (2) on
the H4 time frame, with wave A of (2) forming inside. The third wave of
smaller degree iii of А appears to be developing on the H1 time frame,
with wave (iii) of iii of A forming inside. If this assumption is
correct, the pair will continue to rise to 0.9508 – 0.9681. The level of
0.9042 is critical in this scenario. Its breakout will allow the pair to
continue falling to the levels of 0.8871 – 0.8760.
