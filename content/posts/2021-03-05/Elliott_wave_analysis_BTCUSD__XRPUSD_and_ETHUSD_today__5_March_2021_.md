Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 05.03.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

Bitcoin and Ethereum have finished forming linking up waves. Therefore,
the prices should be going down in the final motive sub-waves of double
zigzags over the next few days.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

The BTCUSD market continues forming a downward double zigzag
[W]-[X]-[Y]. The market has started declining, as it is clear from the
most recent chart section. So, the linking wave [X] must have completed
as a simple zigzag (a)-(b)-(c). Therefore, the price should be declining
in the final motive wave [Y] over the next few days. The first target
for sell trades is level 43060.00 market by wave [W]. Next, the price
will continue declining to lower levels.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Sell 47168.50, TP 43060.00

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

The extended correction (4) within the bearish impulse [C] must have
finished. Wave (4) is composed of the sub-waves w-x-y, where final sub-
wave y is a bullish double zigzag [w]-[x]-[y]. Therefore, there is
unfolding the final leg of the down wave (5). The price should be moving
down to the previous low at 0.390, marked by wave x. Next, the price
will continue declining to a lower level. One could enter sell trades in
the current situation.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] today:

Sell 0.462, TP 0.390

## Elliott wave Ethereum analysis

The ETHUSD is also forming a bearish double zigzag, like the BTCUSD. The
linking up wave X seems to have competed, having formed a zigzag
(a)-(b)-(c). The market is now declining in the final motive wave Y. The
price should soon reach level 1285.00, marked by wave W, and continue
declining. One should enter short trades in the current situation.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Sell 1473.12, TP 1285.00
