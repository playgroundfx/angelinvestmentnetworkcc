XAUUSD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 05.03.2021 –
12.03.2021Alex Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 1816.13 with a target of 1620.09 – 1508.60.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
1816.13 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 1876.54
– 1960.41

 **Analysis:** Daily time frame: presumably, the ascending third wave of
larger degree (3) formed, and a descending correction continues
developing as wave (4). Apparently, wave C of (4) is developing on the
4H time frame, with wave iii of C forming inside. Wave of smaller degree
(v) of iii is nearing completion on the H1 time frame. If the
presumption is correct, the pair will continue falling to 1620.09 –
1508.60. The level of 1816.13 is critical in this scenario as the
breakout will enable the pair to continue growing to the levels 1876.54
– 1960.41
