USDCAD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 05.03.2021 –
12.03.2021Alex Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions from corrections above the
level of 1.2474 with a target of 1.2989 – 1.3308.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
1.2474 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of 1.2400
– 1.2300.

 **Analysis:** Daily time frame: wave (С) of 4 of larger degree
continues developing, with the first wave 1 of (C) formed inside.
Presumably, an ascending correction started developing as wave 2 of (C)
on the H4 time frame, with wave a of 2 forming inside. The first
counter-trend wave of smaller degree (i) of a appears to have formed on
the H1 time frame, and a local correction is completed in the form of
wave (ii) of a. If the presumption is correct, the pair will continue to
rise to the levels of 1.2989 – 1.3308. The level of 1.2474 is critical
in this scenario as its breakout will enable the pair to continue
declining to the levels of 1.2400 – 1.2300.
