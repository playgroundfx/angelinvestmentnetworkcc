USDJPY: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 05.03.2021 –
12.03.2021Alex Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions from corrections above the
level of 104.93 with a target of 109.83 – 111.72.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
104.93 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of 104.00
– 102.60.

 **Analysis:** Daily TM: apparently, a descending correction of larger
degree finished forming as wave B, and wave С started developing, with
the first wave (1) of С forming inside.

On the H4 time frame, the third wave of smaller degree 3 of (1)
continues developing, with wave i of 3 formed and local correction ii of
3 completed inside. Apparently, wave iii of 3 is developing on the H1
time frame. If this assumption is correct, the pair will continue to
rise to 109.83 – 111.72. The level of 104.93 is critical in this
scenario as the breakout will enable the pair to continue declining to
the levels of 104.00 – 102.60.
