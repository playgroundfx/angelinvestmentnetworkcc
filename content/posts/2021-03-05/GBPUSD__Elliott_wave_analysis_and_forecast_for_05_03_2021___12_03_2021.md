GBPUSD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 05.03.2021 –
12.03.2021Alex Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 1.4022 with a target of 1.3552 – 1.3158.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
1.4022 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 1.4235 –
1.4400.

 **Analysis:** Daily time frame: presumably, the first wave of larger
degree (1) finished developing, with wave 5 of (1) formed inside. A
downward correction started developing as wave (2) on the H4 time frame,
with wave A of (2) forming inside. Apparently, the first counter-trend
wave of smaller degree i of A formed and correction developed as wave ii
of A on the H1 time frame. If this assumption is correct, the pair will
continue to fall to the levels of 1.3552 – 1.3158. The level of 1.4022
is critical in this scenario, as the breakout will enable the pair to
continue rising to the levels of 1.4235 – 1.4400.
