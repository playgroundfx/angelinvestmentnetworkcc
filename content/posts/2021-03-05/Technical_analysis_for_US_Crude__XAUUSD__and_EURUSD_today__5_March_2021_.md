Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 05.03.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

The EURUSD has updated the February low in the medium-term chart.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

Expectations for an oil price decline were not met: the rate reversed
the short-term trend up by breaking out the Intermediary Zone [61.64 -
61.42]. As a result, the Target Zone [64.13 - 63.68] was reached. Now
the price is trying to break out the resistance and consolidate above.
If this happens, the next growth target will be the Gold Zone [66.17 -
65.94].

Consider new oil purchases after the update of the local high. In this
case, the new targets for the margin zones will occur. The strong
supports are Additional Zone [63.58 - 63.47] and Intermediary Zone
[62.45 - 62.22].

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

Open buy positions according to the pattern in [64.13 - 63.68].
TakeProfit: Gold Zone [66.17 - 65.94]. StopLoss: according to the
pattern rules.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

Gold has broken out the support level of 1710 and consolidated below.
The target for the price fall for today will be Target Zone 2 [1675 -
1665]. The short-term trend is down.

In the context of the strengthening US dollar, new gold sales should be
considered on the correction in the zone of 1718 - 1710. A reversal
pattern is required in the charts of M30 and M15 timeframes to enter
sell trades.

If the price breaks out the zone of 1718 - 1710 upside, then it will be
possible to consider purchases with a target in the Intermediary Zone
[1747 - 1742].

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

  1. Open sell positions according to the pattern in [1718 - 1710]. TakeProfit: Target Zone 2 [1675 - 1665]. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. If the price breaks out the level of [1718 - 1710], buy. TakeProfit: Intermediary Zone [1747 - 1742]. StopLoss: beyond the level of 1710.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

The EURUSD has updated the February low in the medium-term chart. The
short-term trend remains down. The Gold Zone was reached yesterday
[1.2002 - 1.1994]. The March 2 low was updated.

The bears managed to break out the GZ and consolidate below. This means
that Target Zone 2 [1.1922 - 1.1906] will be reached with a 70%
probability. Look for new sales at the resistances: Additional Zone
[1.1995 - 1.1991] and Intermediary Zone [1.2039 - 1.2031].

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

  1. Sell according to the pattern in Additional Zone [1.1995 - 1.1991]. TakeProfit: 1.1950, Target Zone 2 [1.1922 - 1.1906]. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. Sell according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone [1.2039 - 1.2031]. TakeProfit: 1.1950, Target Zone 2 [1.1922 - 1.1906]. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.
