EUR/USD forecast: Dollar multiplies predatorsDmitri Demidenko

## Fundamental U.S. dollar forecast for today

### The only way to survive for an economy is to adapt to the pandemic

The more prey, the more predators. The increase in the number of
predators reduces the population of prey, which, in turn, reduces the
population of predators. The interaction of a pandemic and the economy
is similar to the laws of nature, with the virus being the predator and
the economy being the prey. The only way for the economy to survive is
to adapt. It is difficult without a coronavirus vaccine. It may be
proven by the drop in the U.S. unemployment claims below 1 million,
which supports the US dollar.

Despite a positive reading, the US jobs market is far from the norm.
Over the past three months, the economy has created 9 million new jobs,
but this is only 43% of the 21 million lost in the March-April period.
The number of Americans collecting unemployment benefits through regular
state programs also decreased from 25 million to 15.5 million. However,
this is more than two times more than the maximum recorded during the
previous global financial crisis (6.6 million). The US jobs market
urgently needs a fresh fiscal stimulus, but the Republicans and the
Democrats can’t reach an agreement.

Donald Trump says too much aid package will keep Americans from
returning to jobs. 82% of 62 experts polled by the Wall Street Journal
do not agree. They say additional payments to unemployment benefits do
the economy more good than harm, as they support consumer demand. The
U.S. President doesn’t agree. Trump argues with the Democrats, linking
the fiscal stimulus size with the canceling voting by mail in the 2020
presidential election.

The red-line [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) influences all financial markets. Trump won’t
benefit from a new round of the US-China trade war, as it would
demonstrate that he has not achieved any progress in this area during
his four years in power. Joe Biden says Trump’s [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) concerning China
is a failure. Trump wouldn’t support his opponent. Besides, the stock
indexes, which indicate the efficiency of Trump’s [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), are likely to
drop if the US imposes new import tariffs against China. China doesn’t
fulfill its obligations under the phase 1 trade deal in full. But
Beijing has an excuse, the pandemic. Everything can be improved. In
2021.

The escalation of the trade war would seriously hit the Chinese economy,
whose recovery pace is slowing down. The domestic demand doesn’t meet
the industrial production, which is indicated by a poor reading of
China’s retail sales data in July.

China could be an example of an economy adapts to the pandemic. The fact
that it has problems suggests that the euro-area economy may also
recover not as soon as the [EUR/USD][3] bulls expect. Unless the pair
breaks out the resistance at 1.188, it can enter the middle-term
consolidation in the range of 1.158-1.188.
