USD/JPY: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 14/08/2020 –
21/08/2020Alex Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions from corrections above the
level of 105.29 with a target of 108.13 – 109.83.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
105.29 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of 104.13
– 103.50.

## [USD/JPY][1] remains likely to grow. Estimated pivot point is at a
level of 105.29.

 **Analysis:** On the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame, apparently a descending
correction of larger degree finished forming as wave B and wave С
started developing, with the first wave 1 of (1) of C formed inside. On
the H4 time frame, a descending correction has formed as wave 2 of (1)
in the form of double zigzag wxy, and the third wave 3 of (1) started to
develop. Apparently, the first counter-trend wave of smaller degree (i)
of i of 3 has formed, a local correction has been completed in the form
of wave (ii) of i of 3, and wave (iii) of i is developing on the H1 time
frame. If the presumption is correct, the pair will continue to rise to
the levels 108.13 – 109.83. The level of 105.29 is critical in this
scenario as the breakout will enable the pair to continue declining to
the levels of 104.13 – 103.50.
