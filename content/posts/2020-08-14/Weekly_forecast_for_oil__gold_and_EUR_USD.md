Weekly forecast for oil, gold and EUR/USDAlex Rodionov

##  **O** **il price forecast for next wee** **k: USCrude analysis**

Oil bulls broke out Target Zone 5 [41.67 – 40.92]. The next growth
target in the middle-term uptrend is Target Zone 6 [49.17 – 48.42].

I recommend entering new buy trades in the two strong support zones:

  1. The broken-out TZ 5
  2. The trend key support [37.23 – 36.61]

I do not recommend selling oil. Sell trades will be relevant if the
trend turns down via the price consolidation below level 36.61. It is
not likely now.

##  **Gold** **price forecast for next wee** **k:** **XAUUSD**
**analysis** ****

The gold middle-term trend has turned down this week. The price broke
out Target Zone [1993.0 – 1984.8] and reached Target Zone 2 [1911.0 –
1902.8]. Bears did not break out TZ 2. Next, there started a correction
up.

The price is now trading in the trend key support zone [1957.9 -
1949.2]. I recommend entering sell trades in this zone with a target at
the low of this week and Target Zone 3 [1829.0 - 1820.8].

It is not relevant to buy gold yet. We shall enter purchases when the
trend turns up via the breakout of TZ [1957.9 - 1949.2] and
consolidation above.

##  **E** **uro/dollar price forecast for next wee** **k:** **EURUSD**
**analysis** ****

The EURUSD is trading in the middle-term uptrend. This week, traders
have tested the trend key support [1.1733 - 1.1715]. We have expected a
buy pattern for the entire week, but it has not formed.

For next week, I will recommend continuing to look for buy entries in
the middle-term. The closer is the entry point to the key support, the
better. The upside target will be the high of August.

An alternative scenario is to sell the euro. It will be relevant if the
trend turns down via the Target Zone [1.1733 – 1.1715] breakout and
consolidation below. If so, the downside target will be the lower Target
Zone 2 [1.1551 — 1.1533].

###  **[EURUSD][6]  Trading tips for the upcoming week:**

Buy according to the pattern in Target Zone [1.1733 - 1.1715].
TakeProfit: 1.1915. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

> IZ - Intermediary Zone: responsible for the price momentum reversing

>

> TZ - Target Zone: a zone that is 75% likely to be reached after IZ
breakout.

>

> GZ - Gold Zone: zone in the medium-term momentum.

>

> All zones are calculated based on the average [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) price of the
instrument and margin requirements of the futures.
