USD/CAD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 14/08/2020 –
21/08/2020Alex Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 1.3348 with a target of 1.3100 – 1.3000.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
1.3348 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 1.3565 –
1.3780.

## [USD/CAD][1] remains likely to fall. Estimated pivot point is at a
level of 1.3348.

 **Analysis:** An ascending corrective wave of larger degree  (B) of 4
has finished developing on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame, and wave (C) of 4
started forming. Presumably, the first wave 1 of (C) is developing on
the H4 time frame, with wave v of 1 forming inside. Apparently, wave (v)
of v of 1 of smaller degree is developing on the H1 time frame. If this
assumption is correct, the pair will continue to fall to 1.3100 –
1.3000. The level of 1.3348 is critical in this scenario as the breakout
will enable the pair to continue rising to the levels of 1.3565 –
1.3780.
