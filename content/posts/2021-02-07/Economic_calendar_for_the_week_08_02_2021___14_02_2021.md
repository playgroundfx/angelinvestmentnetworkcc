Economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the week 08.02.2021 – 14.02.2021Jana Kane

##  **Review of the main events of the Forex economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the
next trading week (08.02.2021 – 14.02.2021)**

 **Trading on key Forex [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/): next week we expect the publication of
important macro statistics from China, US, Germany, and UK.**

Despite a significant decline on Friday, the dollar ended last week in
positive territory, while the DXY dollar index added another 0.5%
closing near 91.00. This was the second consecutive week of the dollar's
offensive movement that started in January after renewing the local
almost 3-year low near 89.16.

The dollar reacted negatively to the data released last Friday by the US
Department of Labor, which indicated a still weak and slow recovery in
the US labor market. The Labor Department reported 49,000 growth in non-
farm jobs last month, just slightly below economists' forecast.

The data for November and December were revised downward by a total of
159,000.

Despite this, the American stock indexes finished last week on a
positive note, trading near the absolute highs. Investors are still
optimistic, and stocks are aimed at further growth, given the position
of the world's largest central banks, including the Fed and the US
government, aimed at further supporting the economy in the context of
the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.

The next week will not have many releases of important macro statistics.
Nevertheless, financial market participants will pay attention to the
publication of macro statistics from China, US, Germany, and Great
Britain.

###  **Traders should pay attention to the publication of the following
macro indicators:**

 ***during the coming week, new events may be added to the [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) and
/ or some scheduled events may be canceled**

 ****GMT time**

###  **Monday, February 8**

No important macro statistics planned to be released.

###  **Tuesday, February 9**

No important macro statistics planned to be released.

###  **Wednesday, February 10**

###  **01:30 CNY Consumer Price Index (CPI)**

The National Bureau of Statistics of China will release another monthly
data reflecting the dynamics of consumer prices in China. Rising
consumer prices could trigger an acceleration in inflation, which could
force the People's Bank of China to take measures aimed at tightening
fiscal [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). Increased growth in consumer inflation may cause
appreciation of the yuan, a weak result will put pressure on the yuan.

China's economy, according to various estimates, is already the greatest
in the world, pushing the US economy into second place. Therefore, the
publication of important macroeconomic indicators of this country has a
noticeable impact on world financial markets, primarily on the positions
of the yuan, other Asian currencies, the dollar, commodity currencies,
as well as on Chinese and Asian stock indices. China is the largest
buyer of raw materials and a supplier of a wide range of finished
products to the world commodity market.

In January 2020, the growth of the consumer inflation index amounted to
+1.4% (+5.4% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)), and in May - the value of the CPI index
decreased to -0.8% (+2.4% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)).

Deterioration of macroeconomic indicators, including a decrease in
consumer inflation, may negatively affect the positions of the yuan, as
well as commodity currencies such as the Canadian, Australian, and New
Zealand dollars. To a greater extent, this applies to the Australian
dollar, since China is Australia's largest trade and economic partner.

According to the forecast, the consumer price index is expected to grow
by 1.1% in January, but decrease by -0.1% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) against +0.7%
(+0.2%), -0.6% (-0.5 %), -0.3% (-2.1%) and +0.2% (+1.7% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/))
in previous months.

The rise in the consumer inflation index will have a positive effect on
the quotes of the yuan, as well as commodity currencies, primarily the
Australian dollar. However, the relative decline in CPI may negatively
affect them.

###  **07:00 EUR Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) in Germany**
****

This index is published by the EU Statistics Office and is calculated on
the basis of a statistical method agreed between all EU countries. It is
an indicator for assessing inflation used by the Governing Council of
the ECB to assess the level of price stability. A positive result
strengthens the EUR, a negative one weakens it.

In May, the HICP index (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) increased by +0.5%, in June by
+0.8%, in July - by 0%, in November and December it decreased by -0.7%.
Forecast for January: +1.6%, in line with the preliminary forecast. The
euro is likely to react positively to the publication of this indicator.
The growth of the indicator is a positive factor for the euro, although
the data indicate still low inflationary pressures in Germany. The data
is worse than the forecast and / or the previous value will negatively
affect the euro.

###  **13:30 USD Consumer Price Index (ex food and energy)**

Consumer Price Index (CPI) determines the change in prices of a selected
basket of goods and services for a given period and is a key indicator
for assessing inflation and changes in consumer preferences. Food and
energy have been excluded from this indicator to provide a more accurate
estimate. A high value strengthens the US dollar, while a low value
weakens it. In December 2020, the value of the indicator was +0.1%
(+1.6% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/). Forecast for January: +0.2% and +1.6% (in annual
[terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)), which indicates some improvement in the situation after falling
index in March and April 2020 amid the coronavirus pandemic. If the data
for January turns out to be weaker than forecast, the dollar is likely
to respond with a short-term decline. Data better than forecast will
strengthen the dollar.

###  **17:00 GBP Speech by the Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey**

In his speech, Andrew Bailey is likely to provide further clarification
on the bank's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) decision last week.

As you know, last Thursday the Bank of England decided to leave interest
rates and the size of the asset acquisition program unchanged at 0.10%
and 895 billion pounds, respectively, and presented optimistic economic
prospects. Bank executives were also skeptical about the introduction of
negative interest rates, prompting a sharp appreciation of the pound.
Bailey will also likely touch on the state and prospects of the British
economy after Brexit, which has been hit hard by the coronavirus
pandemic.

Participants of financial markets will also expect him to clarify the
situation regarding the further [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the central bank of Great
Britain. If Andrew Bailey gives any hints of tightening or easing of the
Bank of England's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) in the near future, volatility during
his speech will sharply increase in the quotes of the pound and the
London Stock Exchange FTSE Index. If he does not touch upon the issues
of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), the reaction to his speech will be weak.

###  **Thursday, February 11**

No important macro statistics planned to be released. In China,
exchanges and banks will be closed for the Chinese New Year, which will
reduce trading volumes in the Asian session.

###  **Friday, February 12**

###  **07:00 GBP UK GDP for Q4 (preliminary estimate)**

GDP is considered to be an indicator of the overall health of the
British economy. The growing trend in GDP is considered positive for the
GBP. The UK's GDP was one of the highest in the world until 2016, when
the Brexit referendum was held. Then its growth slowed down, and with
the onset of the global coronavirus pandemic, the growth rate of British
GDP went into negative territory altogether.

UK's GDP is forecast to grow by 15.8% in Q4 2020 (after falling -19.8%
in Q2 and growing +16% in Q3 2020). The main factors that can force the
Bank of England to keep rates low are weak GDP and labor market growth,
as well as low consumer spending. If the GDP data turn out to be worse
than the forecast, it will put downward pressure on the pound. Strong
GDP report will strengthen the pound.

###  **15:00 USD University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index
(preliminary release)**

This indicator reflects the confidence of American consumers in the
country's economic development. A high level indicates economic growth,
while a low level indicates stagnation. Previous values ​​of the
indicator: 76.9 in November, 80.7 in December, 79.0 in January 2021. An
increase in the indicator will strengthen the USD, while a decrease in
the value will weaken the dollar. This indicator is expected to be
released in February with a value of 75.7. There is still a weak trend
towards a gradual recovery in the growth of the indicator. Data worse
than the forecase may negatively affect the dollar in the short term.
