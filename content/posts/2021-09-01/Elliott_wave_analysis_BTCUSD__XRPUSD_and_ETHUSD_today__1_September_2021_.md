Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 01.09.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

The cryptocurrency pairs covered in the article seem to correlate with
each other. There are developing the final legs in the bullish impulses.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

The BTCUSD rate continues rising. The most recent chart section shows
that the market is trading flat with a slight downward slope. Corrective
wave 4 must have completed as a double three [W]-[X]-[Y]. The Bitcoin
price should continue rising in wave 5 to a level of 51100.00. When the
market reached the indicated level, the price could turn down and start
a new downtrend.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 47260.01, TP 51100.00

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

The hourly XRPUSD price chart displays the second half of the impulse
wave C. Wave [4], having started in mid-August, seems to have completed
as a zigzag (A)-(B)-(C). There must have started the upward impulse wave
[5], and it should finish at a level of 1.402. One could open buy
positions in the current situation.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] **** today:

Buy 1.178, TP 1.402

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

The ETHUSD market situation is similar to that of the BTCUSD. The
horizontal corrective wave (4) has recently completed as a flat A-B-C.
Next, the market has started rising in bullish impulse impulse (5)
composed of sub-waves 1-2-3-4-5. There should be unfolding waves 4 and 5
to a level of 3670.00, as outlined in the chart. It is relevant to buy
under the current conditions.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Buy 3429.66, TP 3670.00
