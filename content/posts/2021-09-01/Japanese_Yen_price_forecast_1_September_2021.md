Yen is set to grow. Forecast as of 01.09.2021Dmitri Demidenko

Sooner or later, any consolidation comes to an end. The [USDJPY][1]
pair's one has been too long. It's time to move on to the trend. Which
one? Let us discuss the Forex outlook and make up a trading plan.

## Monthly Japanese yen fundamental forecast

People don't just give up power. Despite falling ratings, Japanese Prime
Minister Yoshihide Suga intends to keep his post. Rumors of his desire
to dissolve parliament in mid-September, set the date for the general
election on October 17, and postpone the vote on leadership in his own
Liberal Democratic Party from September 29 to a later period provoked a
USDJPY rally. The pair has been in consolidation for a long time, but
this cannot continue indefinitely.

According to Bank of America, rising political risks in Japan, an
increase in the number of mergers and acquisitions outside the country
and the creation of a new National University Research Fund with an
initial capital of ¥4.5 trillion will increase the volatility of the
analyzed pair and strengthen the US dollar up to ¥116. As the Fed is
winding down monetary stimulus and Japan is ready to return to an era of
frequent government changes, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are forced to move capital out of
Japan. In this case, the USDJPY pair can only grow. Especially in the
context of Japan's transition to a negative base balance of payments in
the fourth quarter.

### Dynamics of yen volatility

Due to the elections, rumors are growing that either Yoshihide Suga or
his successor will interfere in monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). The likelihood of this
is minimal. The government wants the Bank of Japan to adhere to the easy
money [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) or soften it. BoJ's deputy governor, Masazumi Wakatabe,
says it doesn't make sense to do this right now, but if the timeline for
economic recovery due to the Delta is delayed, the central bank is ready
to use all its power.

Wakatabe warned about the risks of early QE withdrawing. Even if the Fed
takes the path of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) normalization, and rising commodity
prices will accelerate inflation in Japan, it is premature to abandon
monetary stimulus.

### Dynamics of the BoJ balance sheet

Investors expect the BoJ to turn dovish in September and GDP and other
macroeconomic indicators to lower in October. Against this background,
the Fed's readiness to begin tapering the QE program for $120 billion
per month has a favorable effect on the [USDJPY][1] bulls.

Thus, the divergences in US-Japan economic growth and in monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), the growth of political risks in Japan and the associated
capital flow from Asia to North America create the preconditions for the
analyzed pair to leave the range of medium-term consolidation with
subsequent growth.

### Monthly [USDJPY][1] trading plan

Recovery of the [USDJPY][1] uptrend looks very likely, provided a strong
US jobs report for August and a rally in US Treasury yields. [My
forecasts][2] about the growth of the pair to 111.7 and 113.7 remain
valid. I recommend buying the pair.
