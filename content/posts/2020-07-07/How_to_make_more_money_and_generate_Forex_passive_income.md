 **1\. How to make money from copy trading forex (social trading)**

Copy trading or social trading is a unique service that allows
successful traders to share their trading signals and trading behavior
with newbies and [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s, making extra profits. You will find a
detailed guide to how an [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) can join social trading platforms and
start copying trading in this [here][1]. In this article, I will cover
the advantages and opportunities that social trading provides to traders
who want to share their trading behavior.

 **Advantages of social trading:**

  *  **You generate passive income from the profits of those who copy your trades.** If a trader is losing money for some reason, you won’t lose anything. If the trader, thanks to your trading signals, has made a profit, you receive the percentage of his/her profit that you define yourself.
  *  **Attracting new [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s who copy your trades (domino effect).** The more traders are copying your trades, the higher is your [ranking](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/crypto-exchange-ranking/), and the more popular you are for potential [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s. Potential [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s see the number of traders who already copy you like the indicator of your performance.

Accordingly, the more new [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s you have, the higher is your passive
income. You will receive your commission once a new [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) joins a
copy trading platform, makes a deposit, and copies the first trade.

  *  **You can make profits from referral links of those who copy your trader (I will explain this further).**

When other traders copy your trades you will also feel psychological
satisfaction. It is pleasant to know that other people are interested in
your knowledge and experience. At least it makes you more self-confident
and motivated to develop your trading skills.

How it works. In your [Client Profile][2], you click on the Profile tab
and open the section “About me”.

income][3]

Next, you click on Edit and switch on the option “Make available for
copy trading”. If you have activated this function, you will see the
Trader’s questionnaire.

![LiteForex: How to make more money and generate Forex passive
income][4]

Here, you need to fill in the information about your [trading strategies](https://www.fintechee.com/forex-trading-strategies/)
and trading style: transaction frequency and duration, the number of
instruments you trade, type of orders, and so on. After you are through
the questionnaire, go back to the “Make available for copy trading”
menu. If it is disabled, activate it again by moving the slider to the
right. You will see the confirmation window.

income][5]

Confirm that you agree to add your account to the trader’s [ranking](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/crypto-exchange-ranking/). And
finally, set the commission rates (the percentage of profits from
copying). The commission for the previous trading day is credited at the
begging of every new trading day.

income][6]

 **A piece of advice.** Be sensible. You set too high commission you
will discourage potential [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s. If your commission fee is too
small, you will miss some profit.

Calculate the commission amount based on the following parameters: the
amount of income from the commission you want to receive, the number of
active [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s who copy you, transaction frequency, and the total
profit from trades over a particular time.

Find out the commission that is set by other traders with approximately
the same [ranking](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/crypto-exchange-ranking/)s as you. Remember, other traders, who provide their
accounts for copying, are your competitors. Therefore, your
conditions/performance should be more attractive for [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s in
financial markets.

 **2\. Affiliate programs (referral income)**

Making money on affiliate marketing programs means that you generate
smart passive income by attracting new referrals (traders). Chatting on
trader forums, you can help beginner traders register with your broker
and start trading. If they use your referral link, you will receive from
LiteForex a partial compensation for the spread from referral
transactions. The more referrals, the more passive income.

 **Benefits that you will have:**

  * Passive income up to 70% of the spread of the trades made by new traders you have attracted. You may not trade yourself, the referral income will be paid to you as recurring commissions [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) anyway.
  * You can build your own multilevel affiliate network and turn participating in the affiliate program into your own business. 

 **Important!** Note that you can combine two types of passive income,
referral income, and earn money from letting your trades be copied. When
you attract a new trader and help him/her register via your referral
link, you can offer than copying your trading behavior. Differently put,
you will receive the commission for copying your trades and an
additional amount of money up to 70% of the spread from each trade of
your referral.

 **How it works.**

In your trader profile, you enter the Affiliate menu where you find your
referral link

income][7]

Important! You will receive the compensation for the spread of your
referral’s trades if the referral registers by going to the registration
page only via your referral link.
