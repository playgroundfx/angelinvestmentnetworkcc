Analysis for oil, gold, and EUR/USD for 07.07.2020Alex Rodiоnov

## Gold price is consolidating a little higher than the resistance, it
may go up to the high of last week

##  **Oil price forecast** **for** **today:** ** **USCrude****
******analysis**

In the middle-term timeframe, oil is trading under the resistance Target
Zone 5 [41.67 – 40.92]. The trend is up. To enter purchasers at good
prices, one needs to expect a correction down to the key support zone
[33.64 — 32.86].

In the shorter timeframe, oil reached Target Zone 5 [41.67 – 40.92]
yesterday. After the price had reached the resistance, traders closed
large purchasers and opened sell positions. The price is now moving
down, but the trend is still up.

The trend key support is at [37.54 – 37.15]. The intraday support is now
at [39.05 – 38.86]. Enter new buy trades on the correction according to
the patterns and hold the existing ones up with a stop at the breakeven.

##  **Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis**

Gold price is trading between Target Zone 5 [1757.2 - 1751.2] and Target
Zone 6 [1817.2 – 1811.2]. The middle-term trend is up. To enter new
middle-term buy positions, I suggest expecting the test of the key
support zone [1707.1 - 1699.0] and looking for a buy pattern.

The gold short-term trend is up. The price came close to the local high
1789.0 yesterday. The high was not broken through. Besides, the price
broke out the resistance Additional Zone [1780.0 – 1778.0] yesterday.

The gold price is now consolidating a little higher than the resistance,
it may go up to the high of last week. The main buy target in the
uptrend is Gold Zone [1812.5 – 1808.0].

Today, I recommend entering purchases at level [1780.0 – 1778.0] with
the stop below the level. If the price goes down, according to the
alternative scenario, and the buy trades are closed with a stop loss,
there will be a false breakout pattern. In this case, we shall sell gold
according to the pattern.

  2. If the price consolidates below 1770.0, sell on the correction. TakeProfit: Intermediary Zone [1748.1 - 1744.0]. StopLoss: 1783.5.

##  **Euro to dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis**

Euro buyers are trying to break through the resistance at [1.1368 –
1.1350]. Yesterday, there was a strong price rise. The price is
consolidating today. If the yesterday’s upward momentum continues, the
resistance will be broken out. In this case, the next buy target will be
Target Zone 2 [1.1550 — 1.1532].

![LiteForex: Analysis for oil, gold, and EUR/USD for 07.07.2020][7]

The EURUSD short-term trend has turned up. Today, I suggest entering buy
trades on the retest of the broken-out Intermediary Zone [1.1285 –
1.1276]. The buy target is Target Zone [1.1385 - 1.1367]. The zone is
70% likely to be reached by the price.

The trend key support is in the zone of [1.1254 – 1.1245]. As long as
this zone is held, it will be not relevant to sell.

Buy in Intermediary Zone [1.1285 - 1.1276]. TakeProfit: Target Zone
[1.1385 - 1.1367]. StopLoss: 1.1250.
