Economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the week 05.07.2021 – 11.07.2021Jana Kane

##  **Review of the main events of the Forex economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the
next trading week (05.07.2021 – 11.07.2021)**

 **Trading on key Forex [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/): next week we expect the publication of
important macro statistics from Australia, Germany, Eurozone, the US,
China, Canada, as well as the results of the RB of Australia meeting.**

The dollar rose immediately after the publication on Friday of
contradictory data provided by the US Department of Labor, according to
which the number of jobs in June increased by 850,000. The data for May
was revised upwards from +559,000 to +583,000, 5.9% from 5.8% in May.
Economists had forecast 706,000 job growth and 5.6% unemployment. The
DXY dollar index first rose to 92.75 from 92.65, but then fell to 92.45,
ending Friday with a decline, but still finishing the week with an
increase of 0.6%.

The fall in the dollar after the publication of the NFP can also
probably be associated with profit taking by many market participants at
the end of the trading week. Still, this decline is likely to be
limited. More and more factors speak in favor of the strengthening of
the dollar. Job growth was the highest since August last year and
surpassed economists' forecasts. Another positive signal for the dollar
was the reduction in the number of initial jobless claims in the week of
June 20-26 by 51,000, to 364,000, which is the minimum for the period of
the pandemic.

 The dollar is also in demand again as a defensive asset amid the
worldwide spread of the new delta strain of coronavirus.

The American stock indices S&P 500 and NASDAQ100 finished the last week
at new record highs, and the industrial DJIA with a decent gain. The
June employment report confirmed that the US economy continues to
actively recover.

Next week, financial market participants will pay attention to the
publication of important macro statistics from Australia, Germany, the
Eurozone, the US, China, Canada, as well as the results of the meeting
of the RB of Australia.

 **Traders should pay attention to the publication of the following
macro indicators:**

 ***during the coming week, new events may be added to the [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) and
/ or some scheduled events may be canceled**

 ****GMT time**

###  **Monday, July 5**

###  **01:30 AUD Retail Sales Index**

Retail Sales Index is published monthly by the Australian Bureau of
Statistics and measures total retail sales. The index is often
considered an indicator of consumer confidence and reflects the health
of the retail sector in the near term. A rise in the index is usually
positive for the AUD; a decrease in the indicator will negatively affect
the AUD. Previous index value (for April) +1.1% (+0.1% preliminary
estimate for May). If the data turns out to be weaker than the previous
value, the AUD may sharply decline in the short term, but if it's above
the previous values, the AUD is likely to strengthen.

###  **Tuesday, July 6**

###  **04:30 AUD RBA's decision on interest rate. RBA's accompanying
statement**

In March 2020, the RBA made 2 rate cuts, bringing it to the level of
0.25%, and launched a quantitative easing program. At the same time, for
the 3-year government bonds of Australia, the target level of yield is
set at 0.25%. The RBA has launched a lending program for the banking
system in the amount of at least A$ 90 billion.

In early November 2020, the RB of Australia lowered its key rate again,
bringing it and its 3-year bond target to 0.10% from 0.25%, and
announced A$ 100 billion quantitative easing program to support the
incipient economic recovery.

The main negative factors for the Australian economy are weak wages
growth, a weak labor market and a slowdown in growth. Annual inflation
has remained below the RBA's target range of 2% -3% for four years.

Unemployment in the country has remained above the 5% level for many
years, unwilling to decline. Now, the Australian economy is experiencing
difficulties due to the coronavirus pandemic, which has hit the tourism
and transport sectors hard.

It is expected that at this meeting the Central Bank of Australia will
leave the rate at the current level of 0.1%, although unexpected
decisions are not ruled out.

In an accompanying statement, the leaders of the RBA will explain the
reasons for the decision on the rate. If the RBA signals the possibility
of further easing of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) in the near future, the risks of a
fall in the Australian dollar will increase.

###  **06:00 AUD Speech by the head of the RBA Philip Lowe**

In his speech, Philip Lowe will assess the current situation in the
Australian economy and comment on the bank's decision on monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).

Market participants would also like to hear Lowe's views on the outlook
for central bank [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and
Australia's first recession in 30 years. According to Lowe, "there is no
serious argument in favor of tightening monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) in the short
term," and "it will be some time before interest rates rise."

Any signals from him regarding a change in the plans of the RBA's
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) will cause a sharp increase in volatility in the AUD
trading and on the Australian stock market. If he does not touch upon
the topic of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), the market reaction to his speech will be
weak.

###  **09:00 EUR Retail sales in the Eurozone**

Retail sales is a major consumer spending indicator that shows the
change in retail sales. A high result strengthens the euro, and vice
versa, a low result weakens it. Forecast for May: +4.1% (+7.9% yoy)
against -3.1% and + 23.9% (yoy) in March, +3.0% and -2.9% (in annual
[terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) in February, -5.9% and -6.4% (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) in January. The
data suggests that, despite the rise in indices, retail sales have not
yet reached pre-coronavirus levels after a sharp drop in March-April
2020, when strict quarantine measures were in force in Europe.
Nevertheless, better-than-expected data is likely to have a positive
effect on the euro.

###  **14:00 USD** Services PMI from ISM

This indicator assesses the state of the services sector in the US
economy. These services sectors (as opposed to the manufacturing sector)
have practically no impact on the country's GDP.

This indicator came out with a value of 64.0 in May, and 55.3 in
February. A result above 50 is seen as positive for the USD. However, a
relative decline in the index could negatively affect the dollar in the
short term. Forecast for June: 63.5, which is likely to have a positive
overall effect on the USD.

###  **Wednesday, July 7**

###  **18:00 USD Minutes of the June meeting of the Fed Open Market
Committee ("FOMC minutes")**

The publication of the minutes is extremely important for determining
the course of the current Fed [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) and the prospects for raising
interest of the rates in the United States. The volatility of trading in
financial markets during the publication of the minutes usually
increases, since the text often contains either changes or clarifying
details regarding the results of the last FOMC meeting.

As you know, following the results of the next meeting, which ended on
June 16, the Fed leaders kept key interest rates in the range of 0.00%
-0.25%, and the volume of the QE asset purchase program at the level of
$120 billion per month. The accompanying statement said that the Fed
will continue to adhere to the current parameters of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
until the target levels for inflation and maximum employment are
reached, and the level of interest rates will not change.

Recently, more and more often you can hear contradictory statements from
the Fed leaders, which seem to have completely confused market
participants. Some of the leaders of the Fed are of the opinion that it
is possible to start curtailing the stimulus [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) earlier than it was
planned earlier.

The soft tone of the minutes will have a positive effect on stock
indices and negatively on the US dollar. The tough rhetoric of the Fed
leaders regarding the prospects for monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) will push the dollar
to further growth.

###  **Thursday, July 8**

###  **02:15 AUD Speech by the head of the RBA Philip Lowe**

In his speech, Philip Lowy will assess the current situation in the
Australian economy and point out further plans for the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
of the department.

Market participants would also like to hear Lowe's views on central bank
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and Australia's first
recession in 30 years. According to Lowe, "there is no serious argument
in favor of tightening monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) in the short term," and "it will
be some time before interest rates rise."

Any signals from him regarding a change in the plans of the RBA's
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) will cause a sharp increase in volatility in the AUD
trading and on the Australian stock market. If he does not touch upon
the topic of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), the market reaction to his speech will be
weak.

###  **Friday, July 9**

###  **01:30 CNY Consumer Price Index (CPI)**

The National Bureau of Statistics of China will release another monthly
data reflecting the dynamics of consumer prices in China. The rise in
consumer prices could trigger an acceleration in inflation, which could
force the People's Bank of China to take measures aimed at tightening
fiscal [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). Increased growth in consumer inflation may cause
appreciation of the yuan, a weak result will put pressure on the yuan.

China's economy, according to various estimates, is already the largest
in the world, pushing the US economy into second place. Therefore, the
publication of important macroeconomic indicators of this country has a
significant impact on world financial markets, primarily on the
positions of the yuan, other Asian currencies, the dollar, commodity
currencies, as well as on Chinese and Asian stock indices. China is the
largest buyer of raw materials and a supplier of the widest range of
finished products to the world commodity market.

In January 2021, the growth of the consumer inflation index amounted to
+1.0% (-0.3% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)), in February +0.6% (-0.2% in annual
[terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)), and in May -0.2 % (+1.3% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)).

Deterioration in macroeconomic indicators, including a decrease in
consumer inflation, may negatively affect the positions of the yuan, as
well as commodity currencies such as the Canadian, Australian, and New
Zealand dollars. To a greater extent, this applies to the Australian
dollar, since China is Australia's largest trade and economic partner.

According to the forecast, the consumer price index is expected to grow
by zero in May, but an increase of +1.4% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/).

The rise in the consumer inflation index will have a positive effect on
the quotes of the yuan, as well as commodity currencies. However, the
data is worse than forecast and the relative decline in CPI may
negatively affect them.

###  **12:30 CAD Unemployment rate in Canada**

Statistics Canada is to publish data on the country's labor market for
June. Unemployment has risen in Canada in recent months amid massive
business closures due to coronavirus and layoffs. Unemployment rose from
the usual 5.6% - 5.7% to 7.8% in March and already up to 13.7% in May
2020. If unemployment continues to rise, the Canadian dollar will
decline. If the data is better than the previous value, the Canadian
dollar will strengthen. A decrease in the unemployment rate is a
positive factor for the CAD, an increase in unemployment is a negative
factor. Unemployment is expected to be 8.2% in June (against 8.2% in
May, 8.1% in April, 7.5% in March, 8.2% in February, 9.4% in January,
8.8% in December, 8.6% in November).
