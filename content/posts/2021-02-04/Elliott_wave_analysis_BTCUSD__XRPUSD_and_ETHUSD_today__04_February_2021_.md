Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 04.02.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

The Ripple price is declining in corrective wave 2; Bitcoin and Ethereum
are forming the initial parts of the fifth sub-waves.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

The BTCUSD market is forming the upward five-wave impulse, with the
bearish corrective wave 4 completed inside. Wave 4 is a bearish triple
zigzag [W]-[X]-[Y]-[X]-[Z]. Next, the market turned up and started
rising in the initial leg of the fifth impulse wave. The sub-waves [1]
and [2] have completed, and the price is now growing in sub-wave [3].
The market should go up above the final level of wave [X], 40109.00.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 37736.50 TP 40109.00

* * *

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

The most recent chart section shows the formation of the initial part of
the impulse wave (3). The price has sharply risen in impulse 1. Next,
the market dropped in the corrective wave 2. Wave 2 is likely to be a
simple zigzag [a]-[b]-[c], where [b] is a double zigzag, and the [c]
impulse has started developing. Therefore, the price should be declining
in the [c] impulse to a level of 0.300. One could enter sales in the
current situation.

### Trading plan for **[XRPUSD][2]** today:

Sell 0.383, TP 0.300

* * *

## Elliott wave Ethereum analysis

There is forming the upward impulse wave composed of sub-waves
1-2-3-4-5. The impulse sub-waves 1 and 3, and the corrective waves 2 and
4 have completed. Wave 4 has recently finished as a triangle
[A]-[B]-[C]-[D]-[E]. The price is now rising in the final fifth wave.
The price should be rising to a level above 1800.00. One could enter
purchases in the current situation.

### Trading plan for  **[ETHUSD][3] **today:

Buy 1662.65, TP 1700.00
