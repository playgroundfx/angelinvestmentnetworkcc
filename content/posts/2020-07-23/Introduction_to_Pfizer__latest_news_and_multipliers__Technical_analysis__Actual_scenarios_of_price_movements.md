Fundamental and technical analysis of PfizerMikhail Hypov

##  **PFE shares: fundamental and technical analysis, reporting and main
macro-indicators, wave structure, key levels, targets and trading
plans.**

This article is devoted to one one the biggest and oldest pharmaceutical
companies in the world -  [Pfizer ][1]Inc. The company was founded by
two German immigrants Charles Pfizer and Charles Erhart. In 1849 they
launched production of an anti-parasitic drug in Brooklyn, USA. The drug
became popular and the company started growing fast. During the Second
World War [Pfizer ][1] becomes the biggest producer and supplier of
penicillin for US soldiers and the Allies.  It quickly develops into a
global company on war contracts. In 1950, it’s represented in North and
South America, Europe and Central Asia. In the 80s and the 90s, the
company grows again after having invented the world’s most popular
drugs:

  * Lipitor, a drug which lowers the level of cholesterol
  * Viagra, a drug for increasing men’s potency

Actually, the company produces a few dozens of drugs, but it owes its
global status and huge market influence to those 2 pharmaceutical best-
sellers. Based on the latest [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/), [Pfizer][1] is getting ready for a
new growth wave: the company made a $2 billion deal with the US
government to produce a coronavirus vaccine. [Pfizer][1] will
manufacture 100 million vaccine doses under this contract, with an
option to produce an additional 500 million doses later. The deal will
yield additional $12 billion to the company. Considering the global
pandemic, many other countries may want to have the vaccine too. The
drug’s price is $19.5, but the whole procedure will cost $40 as a re-
vaccination is required to develop a stable immunity. However, it’s
still a low price for such a complex medicine.  In fact, the company put
an economic barrier to entry for competitors, which will be hard to deal
with. The company’s CEO Albert Bourla says that the drug’s market cost
is higher than announced by [Pfizer][1]. Still, the Company can’t be
guided by the market laws to the prejudice of ethics in the
circumstances of the pandemic.

### Fundamental analysis

Thus, the [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) background suggests the stock’s fast growth in the
nearest future, but long-term investment portfolios can’t be based on
media’s information alone. Let’s have a look at the company’s current
state.

[Pfizer][1]’s total cap exceeds $200 billion. The stock is traded at
NYSE and 5.5 billion shares are distributed as follows:

  * 72.4% large investment funds and other institutional bodies
  * 27.5% public float,
  * 0.05% held by the government
  * 0.05% held by the company’s top management 

According to the company’s reporting, the top management sold the stock
actively at the beginning of May. The insiders sold over 90,000
[Pfizer][1] shares in total.

The sale was at 38 USD per share, which is the current price level. In
other words, [PFE][1] stock price has reached a strong resistance level,
so we must be careful will buying.

Getting back to fundamentals, the company’s revenue is barely evolving
and located in the range of $10-14 billion based on quarterly reports.
In general, it’s rather a bad sign which indicates stagnancy. The
company’s profits are drained from successful existing products while
new ones haven’t influenced profitability yet. On the whole, the
company’s projected profitability is 7% less than the market’s one and
3% less than the pharmaceutical industry’s one.![LiteForex: Introduction

scenarios of price movements][4]

The company’s operating expenses haven’t been evolving either, located
in the range of 4.5 - 7.5 billion USD. At the same time, the company
strives to [optimize](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/17/added-genetic-algorithm-for-trading/) costs.

In the chart above we see that  [Pfizer][1] is having another wave of
jobs cuts. This fact is generally considered as positive, but it’s
unlikely to be much influential because mass production of coronavirus
vaccines may demand a bigger staff soon. ![LiteForex: Introduction to
Pfizer, latest [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) and multipliers. Technical analysis. Actual
scenarios of price movements][6]

One of the few multipliers that points to [Pfizer][1]’s stable evolution
is Debt to Asset ratio. We see that this indicator has been constantly
growing. It means the balance is in the negative zone and the debt
amount is growing against the company’s assets. This situation is
dangerous, and even more so because the free cash flow is constantly
falling.

The chart above shows that the company’s Free Cash Flow is at the level
of 2010 based on the latest data. Still, I’d like to note that the
situation remains stable. The company’s short-term liabilities are
covered by the transaction flow while current EBIT covers current
payments more than 12 times.

One of [Pfizer][1]’s strong advantages is a good dividend [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/). The
company has been sharing profits with its shareholders for more than 10
years, with over 50% of profits allocated for dividend payments.

Also, the [Dividends per share][1] value is higher than the average
market one and it equals 3.9 % on a relative basis or 0.38 USD in
absolute [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/). It grows every year.

### Comparison of Pfizer with Pfizer G35

![LiteForex: Introduction to Pfizer, latest [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) and multipliers.
Technical analysis. Actual scenarios of price movements][9]

Another interesting subject for analysis is [Pfizer][1]’s stock
evolution relative to its price in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of the 1971 Gold standard. This
analysis method has been described at length [here][10]. We see that
these two values are much different in the chart above. The red chart
which displays the actual evolution of [PFE ][1] stock is bullish. The
quotes are moving in a wide channel with a slight upward inclination.
But PFE G35 is in a local bearish channel. The blue chart touched the
support level at  the 2009 peak. If the descending channel is broken
from below, it will be a good bullish signal to buy.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis above, we can say that [Pfizer inc][1] has been
stagnating since 2016. The pharmaceutical market is competitive enough,
so the company is losing out to more mobile competitors because of its
large  scale and high operating expenses. [Pfizer][1] may be interesting
in the long term because of its high interest rate, but the company
lacks for a new best-seller for breakthrough growth. New covid vaccine
deals will make the company good profits in the short term, but they
won’t be too large given a high price competence: the global interest
and number of competitors working on the same problem is really high.
Still, [Pfizer][1]’s share fair price is estimated as 76 USD, which is 2
times more than the current value.  I’ll provide technical analysis of
those estimations in my next article. Subscribe to the blog, bookmark
