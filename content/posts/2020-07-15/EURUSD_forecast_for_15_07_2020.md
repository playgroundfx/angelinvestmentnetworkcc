EUR/USD forecast: Euro wants to go upDmitri Demidenko

## Fundamental Euro forecast for today

### EUR/USD bulls pin their hopes on China’s GDP report, the ECB
meeting, and the EU summit

When the market is full of optimists, it ignores bad [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) and lively
reacts to the good [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/). It doesn’t matter that during the test of the
COVID-19 vaccine, side effects were observed; what matters is that all
the people participating in the experiment produced antibodies. It
doesn’t matter that corporate reporting by JP Morgan and Citigroup for
the second quarter was gloomy, as the actual data exceeded the
forecasts. It doesn’t matter that some FOMC members suggest strong
uncertainty around the US economic recovery when some US central bankers
still believe in the V-shaped recovery trend. When the glass is half-
full, the [S&P 500][1] and the [EUR/USD][2] can well continue the rally.

St. Louis Fed President James Bullard says the US economy adapts to the
coronavirus, and there is still hope for a quick rebound. A strong jobs
report for May and June supports the idea that the US GDP reached its
bottom in April, and the forecast for the second quarter has been too
grim. Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard says one of the main
reasons for the improvement in the US employment data is the fiscal
stimulus, some of whose programs are coming to an end. Even if the rate
of the spread of COVID-19 slows down, the economy “is likely to face
headwinds,” she warns, which may result in a double-dip recession.

Brainard’s pessimistic tone hasn’t caused much stress in the financial
markets. The liquidity volumes poured by the Fed and other world’s
central banks are too big, so the stock indexes won’t stop growing.

The stimulus sizes are so huge that the [S&P 500][1] just can’t fall too
deep. Besides, the euro has its own growth drivers, so the [EUR/USD][2]
is steadily growing. The price has tested the resistance at 1.14, and
the euro bulls are expecting more good [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) provided by the Chinese GDP
report, the ECB meeting and the EU summit to drive the price higher.

The markets are going back to the norm and start to feature a correct
response to the [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/). They are rising when the actual data exceed the
forecasts and vice versa. With this regard, the pessimistic forecasts
suggesting a 45% drop in corporate profits in the second quarter are
more likely to support the[ S&P 500][1] than to send it down, which has
been proven by the reaction of the stock index to the release of the
reports by JP Morgan and Citigroup. The[ S&P 500][1] should also be
supported if the Chinese domestic data are positive. The forecasts for
China’s GDP, industrial production, retail sales, and investments are
not very strong. It is expected that China’s economy hasn’t yet returned
to the pre-crisis levels. What if it isn’t so?

The ECB doesn’t consider further interest rate cuts. Furthermore, it is
willing to gradually reduce the volumes of the liquidity poured in the
markets, following the example of other central banks. It will be a
positive factor for the euro. Another growth driver will appear if the
EU governments adopt the French-German fiscal stimulus plan at the EU
summit. The [EUR/USD][2] has been consolidating in the range of
1.11-1.14 for too long, it is time to go up. If the price retests the
resistance at 1.14, the bulls will go ahead. If, of course, everything
goes on as expected.
