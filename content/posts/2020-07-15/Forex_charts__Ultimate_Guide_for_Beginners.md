Forex charts: Ultimate Guide for BeginnersArtem Parshin

Today, I will deal with the trading forex charts and [how to](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-trading-how-to/) work with
the live forex charts.

The appearance of different forex charts may discourage traders,
especially newbies. It seems that only an experienced trader can
understand and correctly read trading charts.

But it only seems so. Each type of Forex chart is designed to make
trading more convenient, rather than to confuse traders. When you employ
price charts, it becomes easier to analyze a huge amount of data, so
price chart analysis becomes more productive and accurate. For a trader
who operates with large volumes of information (usually numerical), it
is very important to be able to translate this information to a
different, less abstract form.

## Live Forex charts

## What are Forex charts and price quotes?

Forex trading charts are an introduction to [Forex trading](https://www.fintechee.com/forex-trading-strategies/). A trader
needs to accurately anticipate the price trend direction in advance. To
identify trade opportunities, you should know how forex charts are
constructed, what different types of price charts exist, what is the
trading time frame, [how to](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-trading-how-to/) set up the visual display of the price
action.

In modern trading, there are two basic approaches to the forecasts for
price in the future. The first is the analysis of everything that
surrounds a financial asset or fundamental analysis. The second one is
the analysis of the price itself, or technical analysis. If it is more
or less clear with fundamental analysis; you only need to analyze the
information about a financial instrument, its financial indices,
rumours, [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/), official statements, then, with analyzing the price
itself, everything is different. To analyze the price you need to
monitor it. To monitor the price changes for a financial instrument,
special price charts were developed.

From school, we know perfectly well that the chart is a line that
changes along two axes. So, the price chart for trading looks exactly
like this. This is a line that changes along the time axis and price
axis (quotes).

When the first charts appeared, computer technologies were not
developed, and traders couldn’t follow the price changes on the computer
screen. That is why traders draw the first price charts on the graph
paper. Most often, they were dots that, according to the price changes
during the day, were connected with a line.

A price chart shows graphically the changes in the given data in time as
well as relative to each other. Traders used the following data to build
the charts:

  * OPEN – opening price – the price of the instrument at the beginning of a trading period.
  * CLOSE – closing price – the price of the instrument at the end of a trading period.
  * HIGH – maximum price for a certain time period.
  * LOW – minimum price of a certain time period.
  * VOLUME – number of contracts concluded during a certain time period. 

![LiteForex: Forex charts: Ultimate Guide for Beginners. How to read
Forex charts?][7]

Nowadays, traders can see the price charts for any time period and for
any financial instrument on the computer screen. But the forex charts
are drawn according to the same principles as in the past. They are
based on the time and the price value.

The main purpose of the chart is the ability to always refer to
[historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) data and see how the price was changing some time ago. Then,
based on these data, you can see some regularities or patterns (cyclical
nature), and suggest a forecast for the future and assume what the price
chart will look like after a while. It is the necessity to refer to the
[history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) and a search for pattern formed the need to present the price
chart in a new way, different from a common line.

trading chart shows the current Forex quotes (in our example, how much
is 1 euro in US dollars).**

Let us study the main control panel of the LiteForex trading platform
(live forex price chart).

### 1\. Timeframe of the Forex price chart

A time frame refers to a particular period used to plot price quotes and
display the price chart. For example:

  * In a candlestick chart, the timeframe corresponds to one candlestick. If the timeframe is M30, each candlestick displays the range of the price changes every 30 minutes. You will learn more about the candlestick chart further in this article.
  * In a line chart, a dot is the closing price of a timeframe (most commonly). When each 30-minute period ends, the chart draws a dot corresponding to the final price in the period. Next, all points are connected by a line.

### 2\. List of technical indicators in the forex price chart

Here you can select trading indicators that you want to attach to the
chart.

Now, I move on to explain the [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) of the forex quotes chart. Let's
look at the components of the Forex chart online.

### 3\. Price scale and time scale

![LiteForex: Forex charts: Ultimate Guide for Beginners. How to read
Forex charts?][13]

The yellow box is the price scale. It displays how much euro costs in US
dollars. The current market price, 1.12678 is highlighted with green. It
means that you can buy 100 000 euros for 112 678 US dollars right now.
The green color means that the price is rising at the moment. The red
color would mean that is falling. The thin horizontal line indicates the
current price level relative to the previous quotes, it is convenient
for the visual analysis. As the current price is constantly changing in
the live fore chart, the color of the current price, green/red, will be
also changing all the time.

The blue box marks the time scale that shows the EUR value in the past.
If you point to the candlestick with the mouse cursor, you will see the
date of this price below on the timescale, the price itself will be
indicated on the right scale. It is marked with black on the screenshot.

The yellow arrow shows another scale. It allows changing the time of the
[historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) data displayed. For example, if you choose 7D, the chart will
indicate the price changes over the past 7 days. The green arrow points
to the menu for switching the type of scales (percentage and
logarithmic), as well as the current time and time zone.

>  **A few useful tips:**

>

>  **You can change the scaling manually by the scroll (without the
scale below).**

>

>  **You can move the chart at a selected scale in any direction. For
example, if your scale is seven days (7D), you can move the price data
from the June 1-7 period to the May 1-5 period. You should hold down the
left mouse button and drag the graph to the side. If the explanation
seemed confusing, follow this instruction step by step on the chart
yourself, you will understand everything at once.**

## How to read Forex charts

Trading starts with learning [how to](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-trading-how-to/) read the trading chart. If you
understand the principles of the constructions of the [Forex trading](https://www.fintechee.com/forex-trading-strategies/)
chart, you can next study the factors affecting the interpretation of
the chart (technical and fundamental analysis).

The price movements in the forex chart may be presented in different
ways. Each type of [Forex trading](https://www.fintechee.com/forex-trading-strategies/) chart has its pros and cons.

Let us cover each type of forex price chart in detail and try to learn
[how to](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-trading-how-to/) read forex charts.

![LiteForex: Forex charts: Ultimate Guide for Beginners. How to read

### Forex charts analysis using different types of charts in forex
trading

Nowadays, graphic analysis suggests three main types of charts in forex
trading which displaying the price: Line charts, Bar charts, Japanese
Candlestick charts.

Now, let us move on and study the most important issue. I shall cover
all types of price presentations on the live forex charts online so that
you will able to read forex charts and analyze price movements
correctly. Remember that I use the [US dollar price chart][15] to
illustrate further information. Well, let’s get down to business.

### Line chart forex

![LiteForex: Forex charts: Ultimate Guide for Beginners. How to read
Forex charts?][16]

This chart type was developed the first, at the very beginning; that is
why it is the simplest and the least informative. The chart is drawn
rather simply. Each new period of time has two main parameters; they are
the open price (the price when the new period starts), and close price
(the price when the time period finishes forming). Each of these
parameters forms a dot in the chart; then, the dot of the open price
connects with the close price. Continuous connecting of dots draws a
line.

Nowadays, this price chart is seldom used, as it doesn’t provide any
information about the price highs and lows during a particular period of
time. However, some traders perform their analysis, based on this type
of price charts because it is the most accurate for operating with
trends, as it smoothing such things as a false breakout of the trendline
or a price level.

What should be added? Let’s see main features of the type of the price
chart visualization.

1\. The Line chart forex is not suitable for trading according to the
price patterns, based only on geometric shapes.

2\. This [Forex trading](https://www.fintechee.com/forex-trading-strategies/) chart is more efficient for long time periods,
starting form D1 and longer, as in these timeframes, trendlines look
like the price ranges; to draw them, the key parameters of the price are
important.

3\. This type of display is often utilized in combined strategies, based
on the price chart and EMA indicator, because it sends more exact
signals to enter and exit a trade.

### Forex Bar charts

![LiteForex: Forex charts: Ultimate Guide for Beginners. How to read
Forex charts?][17]

Forex Bar charts of the price was developed after the line chart. This
type of forex chart is more informative and complex. It was created in
the USA, so it is quite popular in Western countries. Most conservative
traders in the West still don’t apply any other types of price charts.
Let’s see what this chart contains.

![LiteForex: Forex charts: Ultimate Guide for Beginners. How to read
Forex charts?][18]

The bar chart consists of a series of vertical lines that are called
bars. In a bar chart, any trading interval is represented by a bar, a
vertical line, drawn from the low to the high of the day. Bar chart
expands upon the line chart, and the bars provide information more about
the price as they high, low in addition to the open and closing price in
a particular period of time. You know that during the price movement, it
can go higher than the final closing price several times. Price high
shows what highest levels the price reached during the time a bar was
forming. The same is with low, only, the lowest levels are analyzed. A
bar chart helps a trader to spot the price trend within a particular
period, which is very important for a thorough analysis of the price
action in forex charts.

What should be added? Main features of the bar charts:

1\. The opening price is the horizontal dash on the left side of the
horizontal line and the closing price is located on the right side of
the line.

2\. Bar charts come in two types: rising bars and falling bars. In the
rising bars, the opening price is lower than the closing price; for the
falling bars, it is vice versa.

3\. There are many special [trading strategies](https://www.fintechee.com/forex-trading-strategies/) to operate with bars, the
main ones are pin bar trading strategy, inside bar trading strategy,
engulfing bars.

## Japanese Candlestick charts

![LiteForex: Forex charts: Ultimate Guide for Beginners. How to read
Forex charts?][19]

Candlestick charts originated in Japan and have become extremely popular
among traders and [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s. It is traditionally thought to have been
developed in the 18th century by Munehisa Homma, a Japanese rice trader
in order to track price highs and lows. This price chart is the most
informative as it combines all main types of charts and surpasses bar
chart as it also provides colour information about a rise or a fall.
Let’s see what this chart type consist of:

![LiteForex: Forex charts: Ultimate Guide for Beginners. How to read
Forex charts?][20]

The candlestick consists of a black/red or white/green body and top or
bottom shadow. Some descriptions include such concept as the
candlestick’s wick. Top and bottom shadows display price high and low
for a certain period of time. The top and the bottom of the
candlestick’s body display the opening and the closing prices.

If the opening price is higher than the closing price, the candlestick’s
body will white/green. If it is lower, the body is black/red.

When the closing price is the same as the high or the low, there may not
be one of the shadows (or both). When the closing and the opening price
is the same, there may not be the body; such candlestick is called doji.

However, no matter how informative this type of price chart is,
candlesticks do not contain information on price movements within the
time interval; they neither indicate whether the high or low was reached
first, how many times price rose or dropped. To get this information,
you should switch to a shorter timeframe of the chart. Nowadays, the
most popular way of display is Chinese style, where a rising candlestick
is green and a falling one is red.

Japanese Candles charts consist of a series of thin vertical lines. Each
candlestick appears after the previous one has closed. Several
consecutive candlesticks, one above the other, form a rising trend, and
the same with a downtrend. As the candlesticks are of different colours,
it is much easier to identify trends in the chart, because they look
like a series of lines of the same colour. What should be added? Let’s
see the main features of the candlestick chart.

1\. A special feature of a candlestick is that the opening and closing
prices are displayed as the lower or upper boundaries of the
candlesticks body. For a growth candle (white), the opening price is
always below, and for a falling candle (black), the opening price is
always on top.

2\. Candlesticks can be of several types: white growth candlestick with
shadows, white growth a white candle of growth without shadows, a
candlestick without shadows and a body, a candlestick without a body
with shadows, a black candlestick with shadows, a black candlestick
without shadows.

3\. There are many [trading strategies](https://www.fintechee.com/forex-trading-strategies/), applying Japanese Candlestick
charts. There has even been developed a particular type of technical
analysis that is called candlestick analysis. The analysis suggests
looking for repeating combinations of similar candlesticks. They are
called candlestick patterns. Nowadays, there are over 100 of patterns;
but few of them a really popular.

Now let's look at the more complex and rarer types of forex chart
displays. Advanced charting techniques open new opportunities for
trading.

## Heikin Ashi Candles chart

![LiteForex: Forex charts: Ultimate Guide for Beginners. How to read
Forex charts?][21]

Heikin-Ashi Candles are an offshoot from Japanese candlesticks. Unlike
Japanese candlesticks, each new candle opens at the middle of the
previous candlestick’s body. All the rest charting parameters are the
same. But these candlesticks filter out some noise in an effort to
better capture the trend. Heikin-Ashi often have no shadows because the
price first needs to cover half of the body of the previous candlestick
in its movement, and this is exactly what the full potential most often
goes to, and the shadow is simply absent, which indicates the strength
of the movement. Taken together, Heikin-Ashi represents the average pace
of prices. These candlesticks filter out some noise in an effort to
better capture the trend.

What should be added? Let’s see the main features of Heikin-Ashi candles
charting technique:

1\. Heikin-Ashi candles chart filter out all market noises, and so you
see the trend alone. In fact, this chart is a trendline indicator.

2\. When the trends are displayed in the Heikin-Ashi chart, there are
almost no opposite shadows; their lengths and number indicate the trend
strength.

3\. In Heikin-Ashi chart type, candlestick patterns like, doji, for
example are much more important. When you operate with common
candlesticks, a doji is a kind of stop sign; but in the case with
Heikin-Ashi candlesticks, this pattern is already a strong signal of the
trend reversal, and so of an entry.

Due to filtering out minor sideways movements, this chart indicates
strong trends and hide slight corrections.

features of trading with the **[Heikin-Ashi chart are here][22]**.

## Area forex charts

![LiteForex: Forex charts: Ultimate Guide for Beginners. How to read
Forex charts?][23]

Area forex charts type is an offshoot from common line chart, but its
displays the price movements by means of areas. Its main advantage is
Area charts are very clean and simple to use. Filling the space below
the price really highlights the price trend. An area chart clearly
displays local price movements, spikes and dips in any trading periods.
This charting technique is usually used to display the profitability of
investment projects.

What should be added: Let’s see main peculiarities of Area charts.

1\. A feature of this type of price charts is that local price movements
are clearly visible, such as corrections and minor dips within the time
interval.

2. An area chart is a great chart type to discover and identify price
patterns.

3\. Area forex charts clearly shows price changes in relation to the
previous period. It highlights the price action without complicating it.
Filled areas make it easy to memorize the price auction. If you need to
remember the price chart, then an area chart is an ideal choice.

## Point and Figure chart (Tic-Tac-Toe chart)

![LiteForex: Forex charts: Ultimate Guide for Beginners. How to read
Forex charts?][24]

Point and Figure charts originated in the middle of the 19th century by
the first technical traders. It was not basically a chart, rather it was
forecasting method, using point and figures. Most price charts, utilized
in the modern analysis, are constructed based on the opening price,
closing price, high and low during a particular time period. But the
point & figure chart is constructed based on just the closing price for
the period. Point and figure charts are characterized by a series of Xs
and Os. The Xs represent upward price trends and the Os represent
downward price trends. Each box on the chart represents the price scale,
which adjusts depending on the price of the instrument. For trading, you
need to adjust the chart according to two main parameters: Box size. It
is the number of points, each box represents Reversal criteria. The
number of points the price has to move in order for a column of Xs to
become a column of Os, or vice versa. That is to create a new trend.
What should be added? Let’s see major features of Point and Figure
chart: The chart reflects price movements without time or volume
concerns, so it can take from a few minutes to a few days to construct
each column, depending on the price movement. The box in the Tic-Tac-Toe
chart doesn’t represent a particular price; it represents a price range
that is within the box size. Signals in the Point and Figure chart are
quite simple: when an O box appears, following a column of Xs, it is a
sell signal. If a new X box appears, after a column of Os, a new uptrend
begins, and so, it is a buy signal. Support and resistance levels are
especially important in Point & Figure charts. As it doesn’t display
highs and lows, these are clear horizontal lines; when the price breaks
them out, it is a signal to enter a trade. Tick chart This charting
technique represents a line display of the rate swings, represented in
ticks. Tick is a minimum price change on the exchange; in other words,
tick is each price swing. Based on this charting technique, the basic
type of volume in forex is calculated, tick volume.

Point and Figure charts originated in the middle of the 19th century by
the first technical traders. It was not basically a chart, rather it was
forecasting method, using point and figures. Most price charts, utilized
in the modern analysis, are constructed based on the opening price,
closing price, high and low during a particular time period. But the
point & figure chart is constructed based on just the closing price for
the period. Point and figure charts are characterized by a series of Xs
and Os. The Xs represent upward price trends and the Os represent
downward price trends. Each box on the chart represents the price scale,
which adjusts depending on the price of the instrument.

For trading, you need to adjust the chart according to two main
parameters:

1\. Box size. It is the number of points, each box represents.

2\. Reversal criteria. The number of points the price has to move in
order for a column of Xs to become a column of Os, or vice versa. That
is to create a new trend.

What should be added? Let’s see major features of Point and Figure
chart:

1\. The chart reflects price movements without time or volume concerns,
so it can take from a few minutes to a few days to construct each
column, depending on the price movement.

2\. The box in the Tic-Tac-Toe chart doesn’t represent a particular
price; it represents a price range that is within the box size.

3\. Signals in the Point and Figure chart are quite simple: when an O
box appears, following a column of Xs, it is a sell signal. If a new X
box appears, after a column of Os, a new uptrend begins, and so, it is a
buy signal.

4\. Support and resistance levels are especially important in Point &
Figure charts. As it doesn’t display highs and lows, these are clear
horizontal lines; when the price breaks them out, it is a signal to
enter a trade.

principle signals and patterns to buy and sell [**here**][25].

## Tick forex chart

Tick forex charting technique represents a line display of the rate
swings, represented in ticks. Tick is a minimum price change on the
exchange; in other words, tick is each price swing. Based on this
charting technique, the basic type of volume in forex is calculated,
tick volume.

![LiteForex: Forex charts: Ultimate Guide for Beginners. How to read
Forex charts?][26]

When working with a tick forex chart, it is very important to have an
idea of two prices at once - Bid and Ask, because they represent a
commission (spread), and, as long as the value of this commission
changes depending on the swings frequency, there may be times when there
is no commission at all or it becomes big enough. This type of chart is
used in a special work strategy called Arbitrage.

Ticks, displayed in the chart come into three main types:

1\. Upward tick appears when a deal between a seller and a buyer was
conducted at a higher price than the one before.

2\. Downward tick appears when the last transaction is made a the price
lower than the previous one.

3\. Zero tick appears when the transaction is carried out at the same
price at the previous one.

What should be added? Let’s analyze the main features of forex tick
chart trading.

1\. Tick charts are sometimes called the chart of market-maker, because
it clearly displays all market changes of the price, for example,
slippages.

2\. Tick forex chart will suit you for trading only if your broker
provides trading with minimum spreads or with zero spreads, the trends,
represented in tick charts are too short.

## Renko chart (Renko candlesticks)

![LiteForex: Forex charts: Ultimate Guide for Beginners. How to read
Forex charts?][27]

Renko charting technique is a mix of a plain Japanese candlestick chart
and the work principle of Point and Figure chart. Renko charts were
developed to filter out the market noise that often appears in common
charts during sideways trends (trading flat). Due to Renko construction
principle, it rarely displays flat, so it seems that there are always
trends in the chart. To operate with a Renko chart, like with Tic-Tac-
Toe chart, you need to adjust two major parameters:

1\. The brick size represents how much the price should change to draw a
Renko candlestick in the chart.

2\. Reversal criteria. The number of points the price has to move in
order for a new candlestick to form. This is a basic parameter whose is
twice as much as the Renko bar size.

What should be added? Let’s see main feature of Renko chart type.

1\. Renko charts excels at highlighting trends as it ignores “noise”
movements that are less than the brick size.

2\. Renko forex charts almost completely filter out market noises, but
you must remember that you need to trade in middle-term time frames.

3\. Oscillators are much more accurate with this chart type.

4\. Sometimes you have to wait for a long time for a new brick, which
can disrupt the work of your trading strategy, especially if you utilize
Expert Advisors.

Renko chart is **[here][28].**

## Kagi chart

![LiteForex: Forex charts: Ultimate Guide for Beginners. How to read
Forex charts?][29]

Kagi chart looks like a series of vertical lines that depend on the
price auction and don't at all depend on time, like most of common
charts. The line in the chart changes its thickness depending on high
the price of an instrument behaves. It is the variable thickness of
lines in the charts of this type that is the signal for traders to enter
a trade. This chart type is basically a technical indicator, as it
combines major principles of EMA. Kagi chart has a basic parameter of
the trend reversal level that is by default 4% of the previous price
movement.

What should be added? Let’s see major parameters of Kagi chart type.

1\. When constructing a Kagi chart, the principle of signal accumulation
is used, when a reversal signal appears and then is outbid.

2\. To get a more accurate signal, traders use the combination of the
previous kagi interruption and an increase in the line thickness of the
new kagi.

3\. This chart type is excellent to trade in long time frames.

> You can study a detailed guide to trading with the Kagi chart and the
description of [Kagi charts here][30].

## Conclusion

In conclusion, I want to add: the charting technique, you choose,
directly relates to your trading strategy. If you trade the price
patterns, candlestick charts, or area charts; if trade in the trend,
you’ll like Heikin Ashi or Bar chart. You trade. Based on mathematical
indicators, then you need something very simple, like a common line
chart. If you utilize Experts Advisors and indicators, you should
remember that [robot](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/automated-forex-trading-robot/)s are developed for a certain chart type. Expert
Advisor is usually universal, but they are more efficient with a
particular charting technique. Many indicators are also developed for
bars, candlesticks, and so on.

Moreover, many traders employ several types of forex price charts to
perform a more accurate market analysis and identify the market
sentiment. Define exactly your [Forex trading](https://www.fintechee.com/forex-trading-strategies/) strategy and pick up the
