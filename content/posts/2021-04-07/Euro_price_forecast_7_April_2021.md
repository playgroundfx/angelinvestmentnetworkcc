Euro is about to rebound. Forecast as of 07.04.2021Dmitri Demidenko

The market sometimes goes too far, and the US dollar is no exception. In
early spring, the dollar was growing too fast, and [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are now
revising the situation. The EURUSD bulls are not as weak as it was
thought before. Let us discuss the Forex outlook and make up a
[EURUSD][1] trading plan.

## Monthly euro fundamental forecast

The future consists of what we already know and what we have yet to
learn. Hardly anyone was surprised by the increased US GDP forecasts for
2021 from 5.1% to 6.4%. However, the IMF upgraded the growth projections
for China, paying for the economic stimulus, and the locked-down euro-
area, which has become a pleasant surprise for the [EURUSD][1] bulls.
They took advantage of a halt in the Treasury yields rally and pushed
the pair price above the middle of figure 18.

Things are not as bad as they seemed before. According to the IMF, the
recent recession won’t leave as severe consequences as the previous one
due to the massive incentives. By 2024, the OECD countries will produce
only 1% less than predicted before the pandemic. For comparison, after
the crisis of 2008-2009, the gap between the expected and actual growth
was 10%. The United States, due to the large-scale monetary and fiscal
stimulus, will manage the recession fallout with little or no loss and
help other countries. However, over the next five years, the global GDP
driver will be China, not the USA.

Both factors, including the US assistance to the export-led economies
and China’s leadership, are favorable for the euro. Furthermore, there
are unconventional views on fiscal [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), which will support the
[EURUSD][1] bulls. According to UBS, Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion aid
package is not more significant for the United States than the €750
billion Recovery Fund for Europe. In fact, most of the EU stimulus will
come in 2021, while in the USA, the new packages will simply replace the
previous ones. The bank estimates the impact of the program adopted by
Congress at +0.5 % to US GDP in 2021, while European stimulus will add
1% to the euro-area GDP in the same period.

By and large, the EU efforts to create the European common bond market,
China's financial openness and the growing US twin deficit are bearish
factors for the USD index. The greenback must have been growing too fast
in March, and [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s realize this fact in April. A case in point is
the decline in the Treasury yields and the lower chance of the federal
funds rate hike in response to the robust US PMI and employment data.

### Market expectations for the Fed rate hike

Currently, the derivatives market is betting on a Fed rate hike in late
2022, and a further 75-bps increase by early 2024. Nevertheless, the Fed
members express the willingness to allow the US economy to overheat. The
Fed does not try to clamp down on the growth of US bond yields, as it
considers it to be fundamentally justified. As long as financial
conditions, according to Oxford Economics, are close to 20-year lows,
the central bank won’t take active steps.

### Monthly [EURUSD][1] trading plan

I believe there appear reasons for the [EURUSD][1] rally start which
will resume the euro uptrend. This fact suggests the trading strategy of
buying the euro-dollar on the corrections. On the other hand, the euro-
area economic situation will hardly improve soon. Therefore, the euro
tendency to consolidate in the range of $1.17-$1.195 makes it profitable
to sell the [EURUSD][1] on the price growth to the upper border of the
range.
