Europe buys stocks. EuroStoxx 50 forecast as of 07.04.2021Dmitri
Demidenko

The last shall be the first. [EuroStoxx 50][1] was lagging behind the
[S&P 500][2] in 2020. But the markets grow on the expectations. If most
positive factors have already been priced in the American companies’
stocks, the European stocks are just beginning to go up. Let us discuss
the market outlook and make up a trading plan.

## Yearly [EuroStoxx 5][1] fundamental forecast

Slow and steady wins. Many of us want to go to the past to buy assets
whose value has increased by tens or even hundreds per cent. Although
the euro-area economy is recovering slower than the US, the European
equity market could outperform its competitors in 2021, allowing
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s to travel to the past. Like the [S&P 500][2] and other US
stock indexes were skyrocketing in 2020, the [EuroStoxx 50][1] could
soar this year.

In 2020, the tech stocks performed the best due to the pandemic and the
associated social isolation. In 2021, the situation has radically
changed. People are hungry for restaurants and travel, and huge savings
and the bond yields rally will support the banking. Consequently, the
[Dow Jones Index][3] performs better than the [Nasdaq Composite][4].
Nowadays, the most significant demand is for value and cyclical stocks,
whose high proportion in [EuroStoxx 50][1] allows JP Morgan Chase and
Amundi to claim that the European equity market will outperform the US
one in 2021.

The Central European Blue Chip Index primarily comprises the securities
issued by French and German companies and banks’ shares. Besides, the
ECB measures aimed at curbing the growth of European bond yields and
effective fiscal [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) suggest the [EuroStoxx 50][1] rally should
continue. The stock index has grown by 11.7% since the beginning of the
year, compared to 6.4% growth on the [FTSE-100][5], 8.3% rise on the
[Nikkei 225][6], 8.5%  -  on the [S&P 500][2], and 11% - on the
[DAX][7].

According to the IFM forecasts, the euro-area GDP will grow by 4.4% in
2021, while the US GDP will be 6.4% up. However, most of the financial
aid in Europe will be released this year, while a substantial part of
the US stimulus has already been worked out. Moreover, the EU
governments are not going to raise corporate taxes. According to Pierre
Wunsch, a member of the ECB Governing Council and Governor of the
National Bank of Belgium, there are automatic stabilizers in Europe,
missing in the United States, making the EU fiscal [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) more
effective.

The European Central Bank will continue its € 1.85-trillion emergency
bond-buying program until at least the end of March 2022 and will start
raising interest rates later than the Fed. Besides, the growth of
corporate profits for companies related to tourism, restaurant business,
and banking will allow [EuroStoxx 50][1] to continue growing.

With more than 44% of exports in the GDB, the euro area has a more
export-led economy than the USA, where the exports account for 20% of
the GDP. An increase in the global trade and growing US imports will
support the euro-area economy. Therefore [EuroStoxx 50][1] should be
souring in 2021, just as the [S&P 500][2] did in 2020. Slow and steady
wins. I recommend buying the [EuroStoxx 50][1] on the corrections,
betting on the price growth to 4180 and 4520 in six and twelve months.
