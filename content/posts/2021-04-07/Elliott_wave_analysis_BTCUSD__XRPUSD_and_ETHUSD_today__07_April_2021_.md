Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 07.04.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

The final section of the BTCUSD uptrend could be concluded by an ending
diagonal.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

The most recent chart section displays a series of the fifth impulse
waves. Let us look at the upward impulse wave 5 marked with the sub-
waves [1]-[2]-[3]-[4]-[5]. The final leg of this pattern, wave [5] of a
smaller degree, is likely to be unfolding as an ending diagonal. Wave
(4) ended at a level beyond the end of wave (1). The corrective wave (4)
must have completed, so the price will be rising in the final wave (5)
to a level of 61800.000. One could enter purchases in the current
situation.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 57551.50, TP 61800.00

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

Ripple continues rising in the impulse wave, which started in late March
after the triangle correction [4] had completed. There have finished
sub-waves (1) and (2), and the price is now rising in the impulse wave
(3). The market could roll down slightly in the corrective wave 4 soon.
Next, the price will resume growing in the final, fifth wave towards a
level of 1.230. One could enter buy trades in the current situation.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] today:

Buy 1.067, TP 1.230

* * *

## Elliott wave Ethereum analysis

In the upward impulse wave (5), currently unfolding, the corrective down
wave 4 has completed as a regular zigzag [A]-[B]-[C]. There is
developing the initial part of the bullish wave 5, which could be a
simple impulse. The expected structure of this impulse, outlined in the
chart, is marked by the sub-waves [1]-[2]-[3]-[4]-[5]. There have
completed the sub-waves [1] and [2] so far, so the market could be
rising in the remaining three sub-waves. The entire wave 5 could end at
a level of 2280.00.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Buy 2103.90, TP 2280.00
