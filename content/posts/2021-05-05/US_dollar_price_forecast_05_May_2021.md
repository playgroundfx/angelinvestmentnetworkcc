Dollar gave in to temptation. Forecast as of 05.05.2021Dmitri Demidenko

Everyone should do their own job. The Fed is responsible for the
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), the Treasury Department – for the fiscal [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).
However, if someone gives inappropriate advice, it results in turmoil in
financial markets. Let us discuss the Forex outlook and make up a
[EURUSD][1] trading plan.

## Weekly US dollar fundamental forecast

The only way to get rid of temptation is to give in to it. Janet Yellen,
the former chair of the Federal Reserve, now occupying the post of
Treasury Secretary, clearly wanted to talk about monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). And
she finally gave in to the temptation by saying that interest rate hikes
may be needed to stop the economy overheating as President Joe Biden’s
spending plans boost growth. Being calmed by Jerome Powell's mantra that
it was not time to think about winding down monetary stimulus, the
markets woke up immediately. Tech stocks tumbled, followed by the [S&P
500][2], and letting the US dollar strengthen.

Investors remember Donald Trump’s verbal interventions in monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) and the greenback exchange rate and how the US administration had
to make excuses for him. Janet Yellen excused herself, saying that she
did not forecast a federal funds rate hike and did not recommend the
central bank to do anything. "If anybody appreciates the independence of
the Fed, I think that person is me," Yellen said. Unlike Trump, Joe
Biden and his team do not interfere in the activities of the Federal
Reserve, understanding what turmoil in the financial markets this can
lead to.

### The reaction of stock indexes to hints at rate hikes

Janet Yellen’s speech concerned [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s, being focused on the upcoming
US jobs report, and allowed the US dollar to strengthen against the
basket of currencies. Nonetheless, the [EURUSD][1] bears failed to break
out the psychologically important level of 1.2. After all, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s
realize that each governing body is responsible for their own job, the
Fed – for the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), the Treasury – for the fiscal [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). If
Jerome Powell says it is too early to consider tapering the QE, why not
believe him?

Of course, everything can change soon. If there are some more jobs
reports as strong as in March, the Fed will have to start discussing
monetary normalization. After all, these strong data should be first
reported. However, the euro area is also recovering, which suggests the
[EURUSD][1] correction will hardly be deep. According to the University
of Oxford, the EU has administered 33.6 doses of the vaccine per 100
people, half of the UK and US. At the same time, the solution of
logistical and other problems suggests this figure will increase to 60
by the end of May. In addition to the seasonal easing of the pandemic
and the opening of the economy, this fact encourages the euro bulls.

The USA also supports the euro-area economic recovery. The US imports in
March reached a record level of $74.4 billion. The US trade deficit
widened to 5.6% M-o-M, and the increase in the US twin deficit (budget
and current account) is a long-term bearish factor for the USD.

### Weekly [EURUSD][1] trading plan

I believe Janet Yellen’s speech should not encourage [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s to take
active steps. Traders stick to the wait-and-see attitude ahead of the US
jobs report for April. Therefore, the [EURUSD][1] is in the short-term
consolidation in the range of 1.2-1.208. I do not recommend entering any
trades in this situation.
