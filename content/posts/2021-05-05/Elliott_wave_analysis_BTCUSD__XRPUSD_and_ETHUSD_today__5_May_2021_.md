Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 05.05.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

Bitcoin and Ripple have started forming bear impulse waves, therefore
the prices should be declining.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

The BTCUSD continues declining in the bear impulse wave. There have
completed sub-waves 1 and 2. Wave 1 is an impulse, correction 2 is
double zigzag. After wave 2 had completed, there started the third wave.
There have completed two small sub-waves [1] and [2] within wave 3.
Therefore, the Bitcoin price should continue declining to a level of
47000.00, the low marked by wave 1.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Sell 54407.00, TP 47000.00

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

The XRPUSD market has started forming the inceptive part of a large
bullish impulse. There have completed two sub-waves within the impulse,
wave [1] is an impulse, and wave [2] is a simple zigzag. There have
finished the sub-waves (1)–(2) within the bullish wave [3]. The price
should be rising in the impulse up wave (3) to a level above 1.961, the
high marked by wave [1]. So, one could enter buy trades in the current
situation.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] today:

Buy 1.411, TP 1.961

## Elliott wave Ethereum analysis

The ETHUSD cryptocurrency has been forming bullish impulse C for a long
time, and this impulse seems to have ended. There could be developing
the initial part of the bear trend, with the first impulse down wave
unfolding inside. There must have completed two small sub-waves [1] and
[2], so the market should be declining in wave [3] to a level below
2730.00, marked by correction [4]. One could enter short positions in
the current situation.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Sell 3244.16, TP 2730.00
