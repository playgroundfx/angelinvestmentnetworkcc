Economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the week 13.09.2021 – 19.09.2021Jana Kane

##  **Review of the main events of the Forex economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the
next trading week (13.09.2021 – 19.09.2021)**

The dollar's decline that started after the publication of the
controversial report of the US Department of Labor at the beginning of
the month, stopped. The DXY dollar index, which estimates its value
against a basket of 6 major currencies, rose by about 0.5% last week,
which cannot be said about the declining major world and American stock
indices.

In the United States, inflation has spiked to its highest level in
decades. Core annual inflation (the Fed's preferred inflation indicator)
in July was 3.6%. The consumer price index (CPI) of the US in July rose
by 5.3% (the latest data on inflation (for August) will be presented by
the Labor Department next week). In addition, the situation on the
country's labor market (the main indicator for the Fed when making
decisions on monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)) continues to gradually improve. So,
according to the weekly data of the US Department of Labor published on
Thursday, the number of initial claims for unemployment benefits for the
week of September 3 decreased from 345 thousand to 310 thousand, which
turned out to be better than the forecast of 335 thousand. The number of
secondary claims for the week of August 27 decreased from 2.805 million
to 2.783 million, and the average number of initial claims over the past
4 weeks on September 3 decreased from 356.25 thousand to 339.5 thousand.

 Raphael Bostic, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta and
member of the Fed's management, does not expect a decision in favor of
cutting the stimulus program to be made at a meeting of the US central
bank in September. "You shouldn't hope much for anything like this
during the next meeting," he said last week. The recently published data
and the dynamics of the coronavirus pandemic are, in his opinion,
arguments in favor of a later start of curtailing the stimulus. However,
not all members of the Fed's management share this opinion.

It is unlikely that the Fed will reduce purchases following the
September 21-22 meeting, but the Fed Chairman Jerome Powell may signal
that this process will begin after the November 2-3 meeting. Therefore,
a strong weakening of the dollar should probably not be expected in the
second half of September.

Next week, market participants will pay attention to the publication of
important macro statistics from the UK, US, China, Canada, New Zealand,
and Australia.

 ***during the coming week, new events may be added to the [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) and
/ or some scheduled events may be canceled**

 ****GMT time**

###  **Monday, September 13**

No important macro statistics planned to be released.

###  **Tuesday, September 14**

###  **02:45 AUD Speech by the head of the RBA Philip Lowe**

In his speech, Philip Lowe will assess the current situation in the
Australian economy and point out further plans for the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
of the department.

Market participants would also like to hear Lowe's views on central bank
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and Australia's first
recession in 30 years. According to Lowe, "there is no serious argument
in favor of tightening monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) in the short term," and "it will
be some time before interest rates rise."

Any signals from him regarding a change in the plans of the RBA's
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) will cause a sharp increase in volatility in the AUD
trading and on the Australian stock market. If he does not touch on the
topic of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), the market reaction to his speech will be
weak.

###  **06:00 GBP Report on the average wages of the British for the last
3 months. Unemployment rate**

On a monthly basis, the UK Office for National Statistics (ONS)
publishes a report on average earnings covering the last 3 months, with
and without bonuses.

This report is a key short-term indicator of the dynamics of changes in
the level of wages of employees in the UK. Wages growth is positive for
the GBP, while a low value is negative. Forecast: September report
suggests that average wages with bonuses increased over the last
calculated 3 months (May-July) by +8.6% (against +8.8%, +7.3%, +5.6% ,
+4.0%, +4.5%, +4.8%, +4.7%, +3.7%, +2.8%, +1.3%, +0.1% in previous
periods); without bonuses - increased by +7.3% (against +7.4%, +6.6%,
+5.6%, +4.6%, +4.4%, +4.2%, +4.1%, +3.6%, +2.8%, +1.9%, +0.9%, +0.2% in
previous periods). Thus, the data indicate a growing dynamics of the
wages level, which is a positive factor for the pound, as it contributes
to the growth of inflationary pressures. If the data turns out to be
better than forecast, the pound is likely to strengthen in the foreign
exchange market. Data worse than forecast will negatively affect the
pound in the short term.

Also at this time, data on unemployment in the UK are published. It is
expected that in the 3 months from May to July, unemployment was at the
level of 4.6% (against 4.7%, 4.8%, 4.7%, 4.8%, 4.9%, 5.0%, 5.1%, 5.0%,
4.9%, 4.8%, 4.5%, 4.3%, 3.9%, 3.9% in previous periods). Since 2012, the
UK unemployment rate has declined steadily (from 8.0% in September
2012). This is a positive factor for the pound, the rise in unemployment
is a negative factor.

If the data from the UK labor market turn out to be worse than the
forecast and / or the previous value, the pound will be under pressure.

In any case, at the time of the publication of data from the British
labor market, an increase in volatility is expected in the pound quotes
and on the London Stock Exchange.

###  **12:30 USD Consumer Price Index (excluding food and energy)**

Consumer Price Index (CPI) determines the change in prices of a selected
basket of goods and services for a given period and is a key indicator
for assessing inflation and changes in consumer preferences. Food and
energy have been excluded from this indicator to provide a more accurate
estimate. A high value strengthens the US dollar, while a low value
weakens it. In July 2021, the value of the indicator was +0.3% (+4.3% in
annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)), in June +0.9% (+4.5% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)), in May +0.7%
(+3.8% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)), and in April +0.9% (+3.0% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)),
which indicates some improvement in the situation after the index fell
in March and April 2020 against the background of the coronavirus
pandemic and growth of consumer prices. If the data turns out to be
weaker than the forecast, the dollar is likely to react with a short-
term decline. Better-than-forecast data will strengthen the dollar.
Outlook for August: +0.3% and +4.3% (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)), which is likely
to have a positive impact on the USD.

###  **Wednesday, September 15**

###  **02:00** **CNY Retail Sales Index**

This index is published monthly by the National Bureau of Statistics of
China and measures total retail sales and cash receipts. The index is
often considered an indicator of consumer confidence and economic well-
being and reflects the health of the retail sector in the near term. A
rise in the index is usually positive for the CNY; a decrease in the
indicator will negatively affect CNY. The previous value of the index
(in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) was +8.5% (after an increase of +8% in the last months
of 2019 and a fall of -20.5% in February 2020). Outlook: In August 2021,
retail sales in China rose by +7.1% (YoY), suggesting an ongoing
recovery from a strong fall in February-March 2020. If the data turns
out to be even better, the CNY will strengthen even more.

###  **06:00 GBP Consumer Price Index. Core Consumer Price Index**

Consumer Price Index (CPI) reflects the dynamics of retail prices for a
group of goods and services that make up the British consumer basket.
The CPI is a key indicator of inflation. Its publication causes active
movement of the pound in the foreign exchange market, as well as the
London Stock Exchange FTSE100 index.

In the previous reporting month (July), the growth in consumer inflation
(in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) amounted to +2.0%. Forecast for August: +2.9%
(annualized).

Despite the relative decline, this value indicates growing inflationary
pressures, which is likely to support the pound. Indicator value below
the forecast could provoke a weakening of the pound, as low inflation
will force the Bank of England to adhere to a soft monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).

Core CPI is published by the Office for National Statistics and
determines the change in prices for a selected basket of goods and
services (excluding food and energy) for a given period. It is a key
indicator for assessing inflation and changes in purchasing preferences.
A positive result strengthens the GBP, a negative result weakens it.

In July, Core CPI (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) increased by +1.8%. Probably, the
publication of the indicator will have a positive short-term effect on
the pound if its value is higher than the forecast and previous values.
Forecast for August: +2.9% (annualized). The indicator value below the
forecast and / or previous values ​​may provoke a weakening of the
pound.

###  **12:30 CAD Consumer price indices in Canada**

Core CPI from the Bank of Canada reflects the dynamics of the retail
prices of the corresponding basket of goods and services (excluding
fruits, vegetables, gasoline, fuel oil, natural gas, mortgage interest,
intercity transportation, and tobacco products). The inflation target
for the Bank of Canada is in the range of 1% -3%. The rise in CPI is a
harbinger of a rate hike and a positive factor for the CAD. Core
Consumer Price Index rose in July 2021 by +0.6% (+3.3% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)).
If the data for August turns out to be worse than the previous values,
it will negatively affect the CAD. The data will strengthen the Canadian
dollar better than the previous values. Outlook: Core CPI rose +3.7% in
August (yoy), which is likely to have a positive impact on the CAD.

###  **22:45 NZD New Zealand GDP for Q2**

The release of the data will cause increased volatility in the NZD.
Considering the recent rise in prices for commodities and agricultural
products (especially for dairy products, which is the most important
component of New Zealand's exports), as well as the fact that New
Zealand has been the least affected by the coronavirus pandemic compared
to other major economies, it is likely that New Zealand's Q2 GDP report
will come out with positive numbers.

GDP is expected to grow by +1.5% in the 2nd quarter of 2021 (previous
values ​​+1.6%, -1.0%, +13.9%, -11%, -1.2%, +0.1%) and +16.4% in annual
[terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) (previous values ​​+2.4%, -0.9%, +0.2%, -11.3%, 0%, +1.7% ). The
data so far remain inconsistent, although they indicate a continued
gradual recovery of the New Zealand economy after its fall in the first
half of 2020. The data worse than the forecast will negatively affect
the NZD quotes.

###  **Tursday, September 16**

###  **01:30 AUD Employment rate. Unemployment rate**

The employment rate reflects the monthly change in the number of
Australian citizens employed. The growth of the indicator has a positive
impact on consumer spending, which stimulates economic growth. A high
value is positive for the AUD, while a low value is negative. Forecast:
in August, the number of employed Australian citizens decreased by
-70,000 (after an increase of +2,200 in July, +29,100 in June, +115,200
in May, a fall of -30,600 in April, -264,100 in May 2020 and an increase
of +29,100 in January 2021).

Also at the same time, the Australian Bureau of Statistics will publish
a report on the unemployment rate - an indicator that estimates the
proportion of the unemployed population to the total number of able-
bodied citizens. The growth of the indicator indicates the weakness of
the labor market, which leads to a weakening of the national economy.
The decline in the indicator is a positive factor for the AUD. Forecast:
unemployment in Australia in August was at the level of 4.9% (against
4.6% in July, 4.9% in June, 5.1% in May, 5.5% in April, 6.6% in December
, 6.8% in November, 7.0% in October, 6.9% in September, 6.8% in August,
7.5% in July, 7.4% in June, 5.2% in March, 5.1% in February), although
it is approaching pre-coronavirus levels. Overall, the numbers look
contradictory, although in other large economies, the labor market has
deteriorated on a large scale due to the coronavirus.

The leaders of the RBA have repeatedly stated that, in addition to the
situation in international trade, the Australian economy and the central
bank's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) plans are influenced by indicators of the level
of household debt and expenditures, the growth of workers' wages, as
well as the state of the country's labor market. In the opinion of the
RBA management, an unemployment rate of 4.5% or lower is required to
raise wages and accelerate inflation to the target range. Unemployment
in the country is not decreasing, and a return of inflation to the
middle of the target range of 2% -3% is not even in the distant horizon.

The AUD is unlikely to react strongly positively to the publication of
data from the country's labor market. If the values ​​of the indicators
turn out to be worse than the forecast, the Australian dollar may
significantly decline in the short term. Better-than-expected data will
strengthen AUD in the short term.

###  **12:30 USD Retail sales. Retail control group**

This report (Retail Sales) reflects the total sales of retailers of all
sizes and types. Changes in retail sales are the main indicator of
consumer spending. The report is a leading indicator, and in the future
the data may be greatly revised. A high result strengthens the US
dollar, a low one weakens it. A relative decrease in the indicator may
have a short-term negative impact on the dollar, while an increase in
the indicator will have a positive effect on the USD. In the previous
month (July), the value of the indicator was -1.1% (after an increase of
+0.6% in June, +10.7% in March, +7.6% in January and a fall of -2.9% in
February), which indicates that the improvement in this sector of the
American economy is still unstable after the partial lifting of strict
quarantine restrictive measures in a number of states. Outlook for
August: -0.7%, which is likely to negatively affect the USD if the
forecast is confirmed.

Retail sales is the main indicator of consumer spending in the United
States, showing changes in retail sales. The Retail Control Group metric
measures volume across the entire retail industry and is used to
calculate price indices for most products. A strong result strengthens
the US dollar, and vice versa, a weak report weakens the dollar. A
slight increase in indicators is unlikely to accelerate the growth of
the dollar. The data worse than the values ​​of the previous period
(-1.0% in July, +1.1% in June, -0.7% in May, -1.5% in April, +6.9% in
March, -3.5 % in February, +8.7% in January) may negatively affect the
dollar in the short term. Forecast for August: -0.1%.

###  **Friday, September 17**

###  **14:00 USD University of Michigan Consumer Confidence Index
(preliminary release)**

This indicator reflects the confidence of American consumers in the
economic development of the country. A high level indicates economic
growth, while a low level indicates stagnation. Previous values ​​of the
indicator: 70.3 in August, 81.2 in July, 85.5 in June, 84.9 in March,
76.8 in February, 79.0 in January 2021. An increase in the indicator
will strengthen the USD, while a decrease in the value will weaken the
dollar. This indicator is expected to be released in September with a
value of 70.2. The data indicate that the recovery of this indicator is
uneven, which is negative for the USD. The data worse than the forecast
may negatively affect the dollar in the short term.
