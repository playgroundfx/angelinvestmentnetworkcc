## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

The short-term gold uptrend continues, the target of which is the zone
of 1757 - 1755. Yesterday, the traders tested the trend key support
Intermediary Zone 1733 - 1731. Today, traders' reaction can be observed
- prices are growing and approaching the resistance level of 1748. For
further growth and the possibility to enter purchases, a breakout of
