Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 15.04.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

Bitcoin and Ripple should soon be developing final impulse waves in the
downward zigzags.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

At the most recent chart section of the BTCUSD pair, there is forming
the middle part of the ending diagonal. There has recently completed the
upward zigzag-shaped wave [3]. There must be forming the corrective wave
[4] as a zigzag (A)-(B)-(C). Impulse (A) and correction (B), opposite
the impulse, must have finished. Therefore, the price should be
declining in the impulse wave (C) to a level of 57350.00. One could
enter short trades in the current situation.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Sell 63403.00, TP 57350.00

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

The XRPUSD is forming the bullish impulse wave composed of the sub-waves
(1)-(2)-(3)-(4)-(5). The strong price rise in the impulse wave (3) must
have completed. There is now forming the bearish correction (4). This
correction could be a regular zigzag A-B-C. The sub-waves A and B look
complete. The price should be soon declining in the C impulse, which
should complete at a level of around 1.412. At this level, correction
(4) will be 38.2% of wave (3). One could enter short trades in the
current situation.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] today:

## Elliott wave Ethereum analysis

In early April, there finished the five-wave impulse 3, followed by the
bearish correction 4 completed as a zigzag [A]-[B]-[C]. The market could
have completed the upward impulse wave 5, thus finishing the entire
large bullish impulse C. Therefore, there should be unfolding the
beginning of the new bearish trend over the next few days. One could
enter sell trades with a target at 2096.00, which is the low marked by
the corrective sub-wave [4].

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:
