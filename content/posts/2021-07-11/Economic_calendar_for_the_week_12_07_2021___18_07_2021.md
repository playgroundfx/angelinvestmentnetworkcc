Economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the week 12.07.2021 – 18.07.2021Jana Kane

##  **Review of the main events of the Forex economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the
next trading week (12.07.2021 – 18.07.2021)**

 **Trading on key Forex [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/): next week we expect the publication of
important macro statistics from Germany, Australia, US, China, New
Zealand, UK, as well as the results of the meetings of the central banks
of New Zealand, Canada, and Japan on monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) issues.**

The dollar closed last week with a slight decline. The DXY dollar index
lost about 30 points last week. The minutes of the June Fed meeting
released on Wednesday showed that central bank officials were discussing
the procedure and timing for winding down measures to support the
economy. However, they still spoke in favor of maintaining a wait-and-
see attitude. The Fed will not rush to tighten monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), relying
on inflation alone, and only with the cumulative dynamics of indicators
(inflation growth and maximum recovery of the labor market) can the
central bank begin to change the parameters of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). Data
from the US labor market published on Thursday indicated that in the
previous week the number of initial jobless claims increased to 373
thousand, which is higher than analysts' forecast of 350 thousand. The
previous figure was adjusted upward from 364 up to 371 thousand.

The decline in the dollar could probably be stronger. However, a
stronger decline was restrained by its purchases as a defensive asset,
while the number of cases of coronavirus continues to grow in the world
with the more aggressive delta strain.

In view of this, as well as against the background of a weakening
dollar, there has been an increase in gold quotes for the third week in
a row. Although it does not generate investment income, it is in active
demand amid growing uncertainty and inaction of the world's largest
central banks, which keep key interest rates close to zero.

Next week, financial market participants will pay attention to the
publication of important macro statistics from Germany, Australia, US,
China, New Zealand, UK, as well as the results of the meetings of the
central banks of New Zealand, Canada, and Japan, devoted to monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) issues.

 **Traders should pay attention to the publication of the following
macro indicators:**

 ***during the coming week, new events may be added to the [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) and
/ or some scheduled events may be canceled**

 ****GMT time**

###  **Monday, July 12**

No important macro statistics planned to be released.

###  **Tuesday, July 13**

###  **06:00 EUR Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) in Germany
(final release)**

This index is published by the EU Statistical Office and is calculated
on the basis of a statistical method agreed between all EU countries. It
is an indicator for assessing inflation and is used by the Governing
Council of the ECB to assess the level of price stability. A positive
result strengthens the EUR, a negative one weakens it.

The preliminary forecast for June was: +2.1% (against +2.4% in May,
+2.1% in April, +2.0% in March, +1.6% in January and February, -0.7% in
December and negative values ​​in the second half of 2020) in annual
[terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/). If the data turn out to be better than the forecast, the euro may
strengthen in the short term. The growth of the indicator is a positive
factor for the euro. The data suggests increasing inflationary pressures
in Germany. The data worse than the forecast and the previous value will
negatively affect the euro.

###  **12:30 USD Consumer Price Index (ex food and energy)**

Consumer Price Index (CPI) determines the change in prices of a selected
basket of goods and services for a given period and is a key indicator
for assessing inflation and changes in consumer preferences. Food and
energy have been excluded from this indicator to provide a more accurate
estimate. A high value strengthens the US dollar, while a low value
weakens it. In May 2021, the value of the indicator was +0.7% (+3.8% in
annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)), and in April +0.9% (+3.0% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)), which
indicates some improvement in the situation after the fall in the index
in March and April 2020 against the backdrop of the coronavirus pandemic
and rising consumer prices. If the data turns out to be weaker than the
forecast, the dollar is likely to respond with a short-term decline.
Better-than-forecast data will strengthen the dollar. Forecast for June:
+0.5% and +4.0% (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)), which is likely to have a positive
impact on the USD.

###  **Wednesday, July 14**

Banks in France are closed due to Bastille Day, which is likely to be
reflected by a decrease in trading volume in financial markets during
the European session.

###  **02:00 NZD** Interest rate decision of the Reserve Bank of New
Zealand. Accompanying statement

After the bank's management decided to cut the rate by 0.75% at the
unscheduled meeting in March 2020, the current interest rate of the
Reserve Bank of New Zealand is at 0.25%. The bank's management explained
its decision by the loss of momentum in the New Zealand economy and a
sharp slowdown in the global economy amid the coronavirus pandemic.

"Global economic activity continues to weaken, reducing demand for goods
and services from New Zealand. Increased uncertainty and contraction in
international trade are contributing to lower economic growth in trading
partner countries," a recent statement from the RBNZ said.

The RBNZ believes that wages growth remains weak. At the same time,
inflationary expectations are declining, and low levels of business
confidence indicate a slowdown in hiring and wages growth.

Subdued economic growth (New Zealand's GDP growth has slowed since the
second half of 2018) and a weakening labor market, as well as escalating
international trade wars and a deteriorating global economic outlook
have forced the Reserve Bank of New Zealand to keep interest rates low.
An additional and unforeseen risk to the global and New Zealand
economies is the coronavirus epidemic.

It is expected that at this meeting, the RBNZ will not cut or raise the
rate yet, but may speak in favor of lowering it in the coming months if
the economic situation in the country and in the world worsens.

In the accompanying statement and comments, the RBNZ management will
provide an explanation of the decision on the interest rate and comments
on the economic conditions that facilitated the adoption of this
decision.

At this time, the volatility in the quotations of the New Zealand dollar
may rise sharply.

Earlier, the RBNZ stated that against the background of "many factors of
uncertainty" monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) "will remain soft for the foreseeable
future," but "may be adjusted accordingly." In the opinion of the bank's
management, for the stable recovery of the New Zealand economy and the
growth of inflation, "a lower exchange rate of the New Zealand dollar is
necessary."

The leaders of the RBNZ are likely to reaffirm their inclination to
pursue a soft monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), which will lead to continued pressure on
the New Zealand currency.

###  **06:00 GBP Consumer Price Index. Core Consumer Price Index**

Consumer Price Index (CPI) reflects the dynamics of retail prices for a
group of goods and services that make up the British consumer basket.
CPI is a key indicator of inflation. Its publication causes active
movement of the pound in the foreign exchange market, as well as of the
London Stock Exchange FTSE100 index.

In the previous reporting month (in May), the growth in consumer
inflation (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) amounted to +2.1%. Forecast for June: +2.2%
(annualized).

This value indicates growing inflationary pressure, which is likely to
support the pound. Indicator value below the forecast could provoke a
weakening of the pound, as low inflation will force the Bank of England
to adhere to a soft monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).

Core CPI is published by the Office for National Statistics and
determines the price change of a selected basket of goods and services
(excluding food and energy) for a given period. It is a key indicator
for assessing inflation and changes in purchasing preferences. A
positive result strengthens the GBP, a negative result weakens it.

In May, Core CPI (on an annualized basis) increased by +2.0%. Probably,
the publication of the indicator will have a positive short-term effect
on the pound if its value is higher than the forecast and previous
values. Forecast for June: +2.0% (YoY), which is likely to support the
pound. The indicator value below the forecast and previous values ​​may
provoke a weakening of the pound.

###  **14:00 CAD Bank of Canada's decision on interest rate. Bank of
Canada's accompanying statement. Bank of Canada's Monetary Policy
Committee Report**

The Bank of Canada will decide on the interest rate. In March 2020, the
bank lowered the rate 3 times, bringing it to the level of 0.25%, to
mitigate the economic damage from the novel coronavirus pandemic.

In an accompanying statement, the central bank of Canada said that the
decision "aims to support the financial system, which plays a central
role in lending to the economy, as well as to create a foundation that
will allow the economy to return to normal." The central bank also said
in a press release that the spread of the coronavirus and the plummeting
global oil prices combined are weighing heavily on Canadians and the
Canadian economy.

In fact, quantitative easing and a significant cut in the interest rate
should contribute to the weakening of the national currency.

The impact of the coronavirus on the Canadian economy and the country's
labor market (in March 2020, unemployment rose to 7.8% from 5.6% in
February, and the number of employed people, as reported by Statistics
Canada, fell by 1.01 million), and also weakness in the housing market
put pressure on the Bank of Canada towards further easing of monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).

However, the Bank of Canada is expected to keep its interest rate at
0.25% at its meeting on Wednesday.

Tough tone of the accompanying statement by the Bank of Canada on rising
inflation and the prospects for further tightening of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
will cause the Canadian dollar to strengthen. If the Bank of Canada
signals the need for soft monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), the Canadian currency will
decline.

###  **15:15 CAD Press conference of the Bank of Canada**

At the press conference, the head of the Bank of Canada Tiff Macklem
will explain the bank's position and assess the current economic
situation in the country. If the tone of his speech is tough on the
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the Bank of Canada, the Canadian dollar will
strengthen in the foreign exchange market. If Macklem speaks out for
maintaining a soft monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), the Canadian currency will decline.
In any case, high volatility in the CAD quotes is expected during the
period of his speech.

###  **16:00 USD Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's speech in Congress**

The Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will speak to Congress on economics and
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). His comments could affect both short-term and long-term
USD trading if he again touches on the Fed monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). A more
hawkish stance on the Fed's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) is seen as positive and
strengthens the US dollar, while a more cautious stance is seen as
negative for the USD.

If he makes unexpected statements, the volatility in trading in the
financial markets may increase.

During the recent (June) meeting, the Fed leaders kept key interest
rates in the range of 0.00% -0.25%, and the volume of the QE asset
purchase program - at the previous level of $120 billion per month. The
accompanying statement said that the Fed will continue to adhere to the
current parameters of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) until the target levels for
inflation and maximum employment are reached, reiterating that the level
of interest rates will not change.

Nevertheless, the rhetoric of statements from the Fed leaders alerted
market participants betting on further weakening of the dollar. The Fed
is now forecasting two rate hikes in 2023, while earlier central bank
officials had pledged not to raise rates until the end of 2023.

Financial market participants will carefully study his speech in order
to catch signals regarding the further actions of the Fed. Any hints
from Powell confirming the possibility of a tougher approach to the
Fed's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) will cause the dollar to strengthen again. His
statements about the need for an even softer central bank [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) will
cause the dollar to fall and American stock markets to rise.

###  **Thursday, July 15**

###  **01:30 AUD Employment rate. Unemployment rate**

The employment rate reflects the monthly change in the number of
Australian citizens employed. The growth of the indicator has a positive
impact on consumer spending, which stimulates economic growth. A high
value is positive for the AUD, while a low value is negative. Forecast:
In June, the number of employed Australian citizens increased by +30,000
(after an increase of +115,200 in May, a fall of -30,600 in April, of
-264,100 in May 2020 and an increase of +29,100 in January 2021).

Also at the same time, the Australian Bureau of Statistics will publish
a report on the unemployment rate - an indicator that estimates the
ratio of the unemployed population to the total number of able-bodied
citizens. The growth of the indicator shows the weakness of the labor
market, which leads to a weakening of the national economy. The decrease
in the indicator is a positive factor for the AUD. Forecast:
unemployment in Australia in June was at 5.5% (against 5.1% in May, 5.5%
in April, 6.6% in December, 6.8% in November, 7.0% in October , 6.9% in
September, 6.8% in August, 7.5% in July, 7.4% in June, 5.2% in March,
5.1% in February), although it is approaching pre-coronavirus levels.
Overall, the numbers look contradictory, although in other large
economies, the labor market has deteriorated on a large scale due to the
coronavirus.

The leaders of the RBA have repeatedly stated that, in addition to the
situation in international trade, the Australian economy and the central
bank's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) plans are influenced by the indicators of the
level of household debt and expenditures, the growth of workers' wages,
as well as the state of the country's labor market. In the opinion of
the RBA management, an unemployment rate of 4.5% or lower is required to
raise wages and accelerate inflation to the target range. Unemployment
in the country is not decreasing, and a return of inflation to the
middle of the target range of 2-3% is not even in the distant horizon.

The AUD is unlikely to react strongly positively to the publication of
data from the country's labor market. If the values ​​of the indicators
turn out to be worse than the forecast, the Australian dollar may
significantly decline in the short term. Better-than-expected data will
strengthen AUD in the short term.

###  **02:00 CNY China's GDP for the 2nd quarter**

The National Bureau of Statistics of China will present data on GDP
growth in the 2nd quarter of 2021.

In the 2nd quarter of 2020, China's GDP grew by +11.5% (+ 3.2% in annual
[terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)), in the 3rd - by 2.7% (+4.9%, respectively), after a decrease by
-6.8% (-9.8% YoY) in the 1st quarter. China's GDP is expected to grow by
+1.3% (+8.1% yoy) in the 2nd quarter of 2021 after growing +0.6% (+18.3%
yoy) in 1st quarter of 2021.

China is the largest buyer of raw materials and a supplier of the widest
range of finished products to the world commodity market. China's
economy is already the largest in the world, according to many sources,
pushing the American economy to second place. Therefore, the publication
of important macroeconomic indicators from China can have a strong
impact on the entire financial market.

The relative decline in GDP may negatively affect the yuan quotes, as
well as the quotes of commodity currencies and currencies of the Asia-
Pacific region, since may indicate a slowdown in the growth rate of the
Chinese economy.

The growth of the indicator will have a positive effect on the Chinese
yuan, as well as on the world and primarily Asian stock indices, as well
as on the quotes of commodity currencies such as the New Zealand and
Australian dollars. China is the largest trade and economic partner of
Australia and New Zealand and a buyer of commodities from these
countries.

Therefore, the positive macro statistics from China may also have a
positive effect on the quotes of these commodity currencies.

###  **02:00** **CNY Retail Sales Index**

This index is published monthly by the National Bureau of Statistics of
China and measures total retail sales and cash receipts. The index is
often considered an indicator of consumer confidence and economic well-
being and reflects the health of the retail sector in the near term. A
rise in the index is usually positive for the CNY; a decrease in the
indicator will negatively affect the CNY. The previous value of the
index (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) was +12.4% (after an increase of +8% in the last
months of 2019 and a fall of -20.5% in February 2020). Forecast: In June
2021, retail sales in China increased by +11.0% (YoY), suggesting an
ongoing recovery from a strong fall in February-March 2020. If the data
turns out to be even better, the CNY will strengthen even more.

###  **06:00 GBP Report on the average wages of British workers for the
last 3 months. Unemployment rate**

On a monthly basis, the UK Office for National Statistics (ONS)
publishes a report on average earnings covering the last 3 months, with
and without bonuses.

This report is a key short-term indicator of the dynamics of changes in
the level of wages of employees in the UK. Earnings growth is positive
for the GBP, while a low value is negative. Forecast: The July report
suggests that the average wages with bonuses increased over the last
calculated 3 months (March-May) by +7.2% (against +5.6%, +4.0%, +4.5% ,
+4.8%, +4.7%, +3.7%, +2.8%, +1.3%, +0.1% in previous periods); without
bonuses - increased by +6.6% (against +5.6%, +4.6%, +4.4%, +4.2%, +4.1%,
+3.6%, +2.8%, +1.9%, +0.9%, +0.2% in previous periods). Thus, the
expected data is close to the average values ​​of the indicators. They
also point to the growing dynamics of the level of wages, which is a
positive factor for the pound, as it contributes to the growth of
inflationary pressures. If the data turns out to be better than
forecast, the pound is likely to strengthen in the foreign exchange
market. Data worse than forecast will negatively affect the pound in the
short term.

At this time, data on unemployment in the UK are also published. It is
expected that in the 3 months from March to May, unemployment was at the
level of 4.7% (against 4.7%, 4.8%, 4.9%, 5.0%, 5.1%, 5.0%, 4.9%, 4.8%,
4.5%, 4.3%, 3.9%, 3.9% in previous periods). Since 2012, the UK
unemployment rate has declined steadily (from 8.0% in September 2012).
This is a positive factor for the pound, the rise in unemployment is a
negative factor.

If the data from the UK labor market turn out to be worse than the
forecast and / or the previous value, the pound will be under pressure.

In any case, at the time of the publication of data from the British
labor market, an increase in volatility in the pound quotes and on the
London Stock Exchange is expected.

###  **22:45 NZD CPI (Consumer Price Index) for the 2nd quarter**

Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a key indicator for assessing inflation
and reflects the dynamics of retail prices for a group of goods and
services that make up the consumer basket. A positive result strengthens
the NZD, a negative one weakens it. Previous CPI (YoY): +1.5% in Q1
2021, +1.4% in Q4, +1.4% in Q3, +1.5% in Q2, +2.5% in Q1 2020. A
relative decrease in the indicator may negatively affect the NZD quotes.
The forecast is +1.8%, which is likely to have a positive effect on the
NZD quotes.

###  **Friday, July 16**

###  **03:00 JPY Bank of Japan's decision on interest rate. Bank of
Japan's press conference and monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) comments**

The Bank of Japan will decide on the interest rate. At the moment, the
main rate in Japan is in negative territory, amounting to -0.1%. Most
likely, the rate will remain the same. If it is lowered and deepens into
negative territory, such a decision will cause a sharp decline in the
yen in the foreign exchange market and an increase in the Japanese stock
market. In any case, during this period of time, a jump in volatility is
expected in trading in the yen and in the Asian financial market.

Since February 2016, the Bank of Japan has kept the deposit rate at
-0.1%. The target yield for 10-year bonds is currently around 0%. In one
of the recent accompanying statements by the Bank of Japan, it was said
that the bank's management will continue to "increase the monetary base
until inflation is stable above 2%." “We will not hesitate to take
additional mitigation measures if necessary,” the bank also
traditionally said in a statement.

During the press conference, the head of the Bank of Japan Haruhiko
Kuroda will comment on the bank's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). The Bank of Japan
continues to adhere to its super-soft monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). As Kuroda has
stated on several occasions, "it is appropriate for Japan to patiently
continue with its current loose monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)." Markets usually react
noticeably to Kuroda's speeches. Surely, he will again touch upon the
topic of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) during his speech, which will cause an increase
in volatility not only in the yen trade, but also throughout the Asian
and world financial markets.

If the bank's executives decide that Japan's economy is stable and the
momentum of inflation towards the 2% target is not diminishing, they
will refrain from changing [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).

###  **06:00 JPY Press conference of the Bank of Japan**

During the press conference, the head of the Bank of Japan Haruhiko
Kuroda will comment on the bank's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). Despite the measures
taken earlier by the bank to stimulate the Japanese economy, inflation
remains low, production and consumption are falling, which negatively
affects export-oriented Japanese manufacturers. Markets usually react
noticeably to Kuroda's speeches. If he touches on the topic of monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) during his speech, volatility will increase not only in the yen
trade, but throughout the Asian and global financial markets.

###  **12:30 USD Retail sales. Retail control group**

Retail Sales report reflects the total sales of retailers of all sizes
and types. Changes in retail sales are the main indicator of consumer
spending. The report is a leading indicator, and in the future the data
may be greatly revised. A high result strengthens the US dollar, a low
one weakens it. A relative decrease in the indicator may have a short-
term negative impact on the dollar, while an increase in the indicator
will have a positive effect on the USD. In the previous month (May), the
value of the indicator was -1.3% (after an increase of +10.7% in March,
+7.6% in January and a fall of -2.9% in February), which indicates that
the instability improvement in this sector of the American economy after
the partial lifting of strict quarantine restrictive measures in a
number of states. Forecast for June: -0.6%, which is likely to
negatively affect the USD if the forecast is confirmed.

Retail sales is the leading indicator of consumer spending in the United
States showing changes in retail sales. The Retail Control Group metric
measures volume across the entire retail industry and is used to
calculate price indices for most products. A strong result strengthens
the US dollar, and vice versa, a weak report weakens the dollar. A
slight increase in indicators is unlikely to accelerate the growth of
the dollar. The data worse than the values ​​of the previous period
(-0.7% in May, -1.5% in April, +6.9% in March, -3.5% in February, +8.7%
in January) might negatively affect dollar in the short run. Forecast
for June: +0.2%.

###  **14:00 USD University of Michigan Consumer Confidence Index
(preliminary release)**

This indicator reflects the confidence of American consumers in the
economic development of the country. A high level indicates economic
growth, while a low level indicates stagnation. Previous values ​​of the
indicator: 85.5 in June, 84.9 in March, 76.8 in February, 79.0 in
January 2021. An increase in the indicator will strengthen the USD,
while a decrease in the value will weaken the dollar. This indicator is
expected to be released in July with a value of 87.0. There is a steady
trend towards a gradual recovery in the growth of the indicator, which
is positive for the USD. Worse-than-forecast data may negatively affect
the dollar in the short term.
