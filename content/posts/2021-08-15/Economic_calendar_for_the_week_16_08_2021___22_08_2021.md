Economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the week 16.08.2021 – 22.08.2021Jana Kane

##  **Review of the main events of the Forex economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the
next trading week (16.08.2021 – 22.08.2021)**

The dollar could not keep the positions it gained previously (thanks to
a strong report from the US Department of Labor). Due to a strong
decline on Friday, the DXY dollar index closed last week in the negative
territory, losing 0.4% and falling to 92.50.

It is possible that the decline in the dollar was caused by the profit-
taking and closing of long positions in it at the end of the week, and
the preliminary consumer sentiment index published on Friday during the
American trading session, as calculated by the University of Michigan,
which amounted to 70.2 points against 81 in August, served as a driver.
2 in July. The deterioration in consumer sentiment in the United States
is likely caused by the spread of the delta strain of coronavirus, which
could lead to a deterioration in the prospects for the US economy, and
this, in turn, significantly weakens the expectations of market
participants regarding an earlier tightening of the Fed's monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). The publication of a more pessimistic consumer sentiment index
from the University of Michigan intensified the negative impact of the
consumer price index released on Wednesday, which slowed sharply (from
+0.9% in June to +0.3% in July). In annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/), the CPI slowed down
from +4.5% to +4.3% in July, which correlates with the US Federal
Reserve's statements that high inflation is only a temporary factor.
Now, to restore the dollar's bullish performance, it will probably need
additional convincing drivers.

Next week, financial market participants will pay attention to the
publication of important macro statistics from China, the Eurozone, the
US, the UK, Canada, Australia, as well as the results of the meetings of
the central banks of New Zealand and China.

 ***during the coming week, new events may be added to the [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) and
/ or some scheduled events may be canceled**

 ****GMT time**

###  **Monday, August 16**

###  **02:00** **CNY Retail Sales Index**

This index is published monthly by the National Bureau of Statistics of
China and measures total retail sales and cash receipts. The index is
often considered an indicator of consumer confidence and economic
wellbeing and reflects the health of the retail sector in the near term.
A rise in the index is usually positive for the CNY; a decrease in the
indicator will negatively affect the CNY. The previous value of the
index (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) was +12.1% (after an increase of +8% in the last
months of 2019 and a fall of -20.5% in February 2020). Outlook: In July
2021, retail sales in China increased by +11.5% (YoY), indicating an
ongoing recovery from a strong fall in February-March 2020. If the data
turns out to be even better, the CNY will strengthen even more.

###  **01:30 AUD Minutes of the August meeting of the RB of Australia**

This document is published two weeks after the meeting and the decision
on the interest rate. If the RBA positively assesses the state of the
labor market in the country, the rate of GDP growth, and also shows a
hawkish attitude towards the inflation forecast in the economy, the
markets regard this as a higher probability of a rate hike at the next
meeting, which is a positive factor for the AUD. The bank's soft
rhetoric regarding, above all, inflation puts pressure on the AUD.

During the last (August) meeting, the RBA kept the key interest rate and
the target level of yield on three-year government bonds unchanged at
around 0.10%. The central bank also decided to cut bond purchases by $1
billion a week to $4 billion a week from September 1, and return to
revising the size of the QE program in late 2021. Earlier, the RBA
leaders said that “it will not raise rates until inflation stabilizes in
the range of 2% -3%. This requires a significant acceleration of the
growth of wages in comparison with the current rates. Achieving this
goal will require a significant increase in employment and a reduction
in free resources in the labor market ”. The RBA expects that these
conditions will not be met until at least 2024.

Wages continue to rise slowly and household debt has risen to an all-
time high, which also puts higher interest rates in the longer term.

According to Philip Lowe, "there is no serious argument in favor of
tightening monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) in the short term." In his opinion, "some
time will pass before interest rates are raised."

Nevertheless, if the published minutes contain unexpected information
concerning the issues of the RBA's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), the volatility in
the AUD quotes will increase.

###  **06:00 GBP Report on the average wages of the British for the last
3 months. Unemployment rate**

On a monthly basis, the UK Office for National Statistics (ONS)
publishes a report on average earnings covering the last 3 months, with
and without bonuses.

This report is a key short-term indicator of the dynamics of changes in
the level of wages of employees in the UK. Earnings growth is positive
for the GBP, while a low reading is negative. Forecast: August report
suggests that average wages with bonuses increased over the last
calculated 3 months (April-June) by +7.1% (against +7.3%, +5.6%, +4.0% ,
+4.5%, +4.8%, +4.7%, +3.7%, +2.8%, +1.3%, +0.1% in previous periods);
without bonuses - increased by +6.6% (against +6.6%, +5.6%, +4.6%,
+4.4%, +4.2%, +4.1%, +3.6%, +2.8%, +1.9%, +0.9%, +0.2% in previous
periods). Thus, the expected data is close to the average values ​​of
the indicators. They also point to the growing dynamics of the level of
wages, which is a positive factor for the pound, as it contributes to
the growth of inflationary pressures. If the data turns out to be better
than forecast, the pound is likely to strengthen on the foreign exchange
market. Data worse than forecast will negatively affect the pound in the
short term.

Also at this time, data on unemployment in the UK are published. It is
expected that in the 3 months from April to June, unemployment was at
the level of 4.7% (against 4.8%, 4.7%, 4.8%, 4.9%, 5.0%, 5.1%, 5.0%,
4.9%, 4.8%, 4.5%, 4.3%, 3.9%, 3.9% in previous periods). Since 2012, the
UK unemployment rate has declined steadily (from 8.0% in September
2012). This is a positive factor for the pound, the rise in unemployment
is a negative factor.

If the data from the UK labor market turn out to be worse than the
forecast and / or the previous value, the pound will be under pressure.

In any case, at the time of the publication of data from the British
labor market, an increase in volatility is expected in the pound quotes
and on the London Stock Exchange.

###  **09:00 EUR Eurozone GDP for Q2 (second estimate)**

GDP is considered to be an indicator of the overall health of the
economy. The upward trend in GDP is considered positive for the EUR; a
poor result weakens the EUR.

Recently, macro data from the Eurozone have been indicating a gradual
recovery in the growth rate of the European economy after a sharp drop
in early 2020.

So, according to the forecast of economists, GDP in the Eurozone is
expected to have grown in the 2nd quarter of 2021 by +2.0% (+13.7% in
annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) after falling by -0.3% (by -1.3% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) ) in Q1
2021, by -0.7% (-4.9% YoY) in Q4 2020, +12.5% ​​growth (-4.3% YoY
decline) [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) in the 3rd quarter, a fall of -11.8% (-14.7% in annual
[terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) in the 2nd quarter and a fall of -3.6% (-3.1% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) in
1 quarter of 2020. The preliminary forecast was +1.5% (+13.2% in annual
[terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)).

If the data turn out to be weaker than the forecast, the euro may
decline. Better-than-expected data may strengthen the euro in the short
term.

###  **12:30 USD Retail sales. Retail control group**

This report (Retail Sales) reflects the total sales of retailers of all
sizes and types. Changes in retail sales are the main indicator of
consumer spending. The report is a leading indicator, and in the future
the data may be greatly revised. A high result strengthens the US
dollar, a low one weakens it. A relative decrease in the indicator may
have a short-term negative impact on the dollar, while an increase in
the indicator will have a positive effect on the USD. In the previous
month (June), the value of the indicator was +0.6% (after an increase of
+10.7% in March, +7.6% in January and a fall of -2.9% in February),
which indicates that the instability improvement in this sector of the
American economy after the partial lifting of strict quarantine
restrictive measures in a number of states. Forecast for July: -0.2%,
which is likely to negatively affect the USD if the forecast is
confirmed.

Retail sales is the leading indicator of consumer spending in the United
States showing changes in retail sales. The Retail Control Group metric
measures volume across the entire retail industry and is used to
calculate price indices for most products. A strong result strengthens
the US dollar, and vice versa, a weak report weakens the dollar. A
slight increase in indicators is unlikely to accelerate the growth of
the dollar. The data worse than the values ​​of the previous period
(+1.1% in June, -0.7% in May, -1.5% in April, +6.9% in March, -3.5% in
February, +8.7% in January) may negatively affect the dollar in the
short term. Forecast for July: +0.4%.

###  **02:00 NZD RBNZ's interest rate decision. RBNZ's accompanying
statement**

After the bank's management decided to cut the rate by 0.75% during an
unscheduled meeting in March 2020, the current interest rate of the
Reserve Bank of New Zealand is at 0.25%. The bank's management explained
its decision by a loss of momentum in the New Zealand economy and a
sharp slowdown in the global economy amid the coronavirus pandemic.

“Global economic activity continues to weaken, which wears down demand
for goods and services from New Zealand. Increased uncertainty and
contraction in international trade are contributing to lower economic
growth in trading partner countries,” a recent statement from the RBNZ
said.

The RBNZ believes that wages growth remains weak. At the same time,
inflationary expectations are declining, and low levels of business
confidence indicate a slowdown in hiring and wages growth.

Subdued economic growth (New Zealand's GDP growth has slowed since the
second half of 2018) and a weakening labor market, as well as escalating
international trade wars and a deteriorating global economic outlook
have forced the Reserve Bank of New Zealand to keep interest rates low.
An additional and unforeseen risk to the global and New Zealand
economies is the coronavirus epidemic.

It is expected that at this meeting, the RBNZ will not cut or raise the
rate yet, but may speak in favor of lowering it in the coming months if
the economic situation in the country and in the world worsens.

In the accompanying statement and comments, the RBNZ management will
provide an explanation of the decision on the interest rate and comments
on the economic conditions that facilitated the adoption of this
decision.

At this time, the volatility in the quotations of the New Zealand dollar
may rise sharply.

Earlier, the RBNZ stated that against the background of "many factors of
uncertainty" monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) "will remain soft for the foreseeable
future," but "may be adjusted accordingly." According to the bank's
management, for a stable recovery of the New Zealand economy and
inflation growth, "a lower rate of the New Zealand dollar is necessary."

###  **03:00 NZD** **Press conference of the RBNZ**

During the press conference, the head of the RBNZ Adrian Orr will
provide an explanation of the bank's decision. His speeches often serve
as an unofficial source of information on the future direction of the
RBNZ's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). In his opinion, the country's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
should correlate with the dynamics of employment and financial stability
of the state.

Earlier, the RBNZ stated that against the background of "many factors of
uncertainty" monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) "will remain soft for the foreseeable
future," but "may be adjusted accordingly." For a stable recovery of the
New Zealand economy and rising inflation, "a weaker NZ dollar is
needed."

In any case, volatility in the New Zealand dollar trade is expected to
rise during the RBNZ press conference.

###  **06:00 GBP Consumer Price Index. Core Consumer Price Index**

Consumer Price Index (CPI) reflects the dynamics of retail prices for a
group of goods and services that make up the British consumer basket.
The CPI is a key indicator of inflation. Its publication causes active
movement of the pound in the foreign exchange market, as well as the
London Stock Exchange FTSE100 index.

In the previous reporting month (June), the growth in consumer inflation
(in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) amounted to +2.5%. Forecast for July: +2.2%
(annualized).

Despite the relative decline, this reading indicates growing
inflationary pressures, which is likely to support the pound. Indicator
reading below the forecast could provoke a weakening of the pound, as
low inflation will force the Bank of England to adhere to a soft
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).

Core CPI is published by the Office for National Statistics and
determines the change in prices for a selected basket of goods and
services (excluding food and energy) for a given period. It is a key
indicator for assessing inflation and changes in purchasing preferences.
A positive result strengthens the GBP, a negative one weakens it.

In June, Core CPI (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) increased by +2.3%. Probably, the
publication of the indicator will have a positive effect on the pound in
the short term, if its value is higher than the forecast and previous
values. Forecast for July: +2.0% (annualized). The indicator reading
below the forecast and previous values ​​may provoke a weakening of the
pound.

###  **12:30 CAD Consumer price indices in Canada**

Core Consumer Price Index (Core CPI) from the Bank of Canada reflects
the dynamics of the retail prices of the corresponding basket of goods
and services (excluding fruits, vegetables, gasoline, fuel oil, natural
gas, mortgage interest, intercity transportation and tobacco products).
The inflation target for the Bank of Canada is in the range of 1% -3%.
The rise in CPI is a harbinger of a rate hike and a positive factor for
the CAD. Core Consumer Price Index increased in June 2021 by +0.3%
(+2.7% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)). If the data for July turns out to be worse than
the previous values, it will negatively affect the CAD. The data will
strengthen the Canadian dollar better than the previous values. Outlook:
Core CPI rose by +2.8% in July (yoy), which is likely to have a positive
impact on the CAD, despite the relative decline in the indicator.

###  **18:00 USD Minutes of the July meeting of the Federal Open Market
Committee**

The publication of the minutes is extremely important for determining
the course of the current Fed [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) and the prospects for raising
interest rates in the United States. The volatility of trading in
financial markets during the publication of the minutes usually
increases, since the text often contains either changes or clarifying
details regarding the results of the last FOMC Fed meeting.

As you know, following the results of the next meeting, which ended on
July 28, the Fed leaders kept key interest rates in the range of 0.00%
-0.25%, and the volume of the QE asset purchase program at the level of
$120 billion per month. The accompanying statement said that the Fed
will continue to adhere to the current parameters of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
until the target levels for inflation and maximum employment are
reached, and the level of interest rates will not change.

Recently, more and more often one can hear contradictory statements from
the Fed leaders, which seem to have completely confused market
participants. Some of the Fed leaders are of the opinion that it is
possible that the start of curtailing the stimulating [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) may start
earlier than it was planned earlier.

The soft tone of the minutes will have a positive effect on stock
indices and negatively on the US dollar. Tough rhetoric of the Fed
leaders regarding the prospects for monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) will push the dollar
to further growth.

###  **Thursday, August 19**

###  **01:30 AUD Employment rate. Unemployment rate**

The employment rate reflects the monthly change in the number of
Australian citizens employed. The growth of the indicator has a positive
impact on consumer spending, which stimulates economic growth. A high
value is positive for the AUD, while a low value is negative. Forecast:
in July, the number of employed Australian citizens decreased by -45,000
(after an increase of +29,100 in June, +115,200 in May, a fall of
-30,600 in April, of -264100 in May 2020, and an increase of +29,100 in
January 2021).

Also at the same time, the Australian Bureau of Statistics will publish
a report on the unemployment rate - an indicator that estimates the
ratio of the unemployed population to the total number of able-bodied
citizens. The growth of the indicator indicates the weakness of the
labor market, which leads to a weakening of the national economy. The
decline in the indicator is a positive factor for the AUD. Forecast:
unemployment in Australia in July was at 5.0% (against 4.9% in June,
5.1% in May, 5.5% in April, 6.6% in December, 6.8% in November , 7.0% in
October, 6.9% in September, 6.8% in August, 7.5% in July, 7.4% in June,
5.2% in March, 5.1% in February) although it is approaching pre-
coronavirus levels. Overall, the numbers look contradictory, although in
other large economies, the labor market has deteriorated on a large
scale due to the coronavirus.

The leaders of the RBA have repeatedly stated that, in addition to the
situation in international trade, the Australian economy and the central
bank's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) plans are influenced by the indicators of the
level of household debt and expenditures, the growth of workers' wages,
as well as the state of the country's labor market. In the opinion of
the RBA management, an unemployment rate of 4.5% or lower is required to
raise wages and accelerate inflation to the target range. Unemployment
in the country is not decreasing, and a return of inflation to the
middle of the target range of 2% -3% is not visible even in the distant
horizon.

The AUD is unlikely to react strongly and positively to the publication
of data from the country's labor market. If the values ​​of the
indicators turn out to be worse than forecast, the Australian dollar may
significantly decline in the short term. Better-than-expected data will
strengthen AUD in the short term.

###  **Friday, August 20**

###  **01:30 CNY The People's Bank of China interest rate decision**

Since May 2012, the People's Bank of China has been steadily cutting
interest rates in support of Chinese manufacturers. The bank last
lowered the rate in April 2020 (by 0.20% to 3.85% at the moment).

In 2020, in the context of international trade conflicts and a slowdown
in the global economy, the world's largest central banks took the path
of easing their monetary policies in order to support national economies
and increase the competitiveness of goods exported from these countries.

The People's Bank of China is also in line with this process. The
depreciation of the yuan has become especially relevant in the last 2
years, when the confrontation between the two most powerful economies in
the world began. One of the measures to mitigate the negative
consequences of increased duties on the import of Chinese goods into the
United States was the depreciation of the national currency of China.
This measure was intended, among other things, to maintain the same
volumes of imports of Chinese products to the United States, which would
cost American buyers less due to the difference in the rates of the
national currencies of the United States and China.

The coronavirus has become an additional strong negative factor.

Probably, at this meeting, the People's Bank of China will keep the
interest rate at the same level of 3.85%, although a rate cut is also
possible.

Nevertheless, if the People's Bank of China makes unexpected statements
or decisions, then volatility may increase in the entire financial
market. Investors will also be interested in the bank's assessment of
the consequences of the coronavirus for the Chinese economy and its
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) in the near future.

###  **12:30** **CAD Retail Sales Index**

Retail Sales Index is published monthly by Statistics Canada and
estimates total retail sales. The index is often considered an indicator
of consumer confidence and reflects the health of the retail sector in
the near term. A rise in the index is usually positive for the CAD; a
decrease in the indicator will negatively affect the CAD. The previous
value of the index (for May) was -2.1% after falling in March 2020 by
-9.9%, in April - by -25% and growth in May by +18.7%. If the data for
June turns out to be even weaker than the forecast of -3.0%, the CAD may
sharply decline in the short term.
