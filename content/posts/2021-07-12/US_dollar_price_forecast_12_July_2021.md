Dollar: from Delta to Omega. Forecast as of 12.07.2021Dmitri Demidenko

Will the Delta variant of coronavirus set the global economic recovery
back? If vaccines fail to protect from the new coronavirus strains,
there could be new lockdowns and a double-dip recession. How will it
affect the [EURUSD][1]? Let us discuss the Forex outlook and make up a
trading plan.

## Weekly US dollar fundamental forecast

From temporary inflation to temporary recovery. Before July, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s
were actively discussing whether the surge in consumer prices would be
temporary. However, the current spread of the Delta variant of COVID-19
makes them doubt the rapid recovery of the global economy. After all,
Delta may be followed by Epsilon, Zeta, and other Greek alphabet letters
up to Omega. Concerns about new strains of COVID-19 encourage [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s
to buy US Treasuries. The drop in the US bond yields pressed down the
greenback.

The US yields have fallen for a few reasons. There has been a series of
weak economic data in the US, China, and the euro area. There have
appeared new strains of coronavirus. Besides, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s wanted to exit
shorts. A drop in Treasury yields is often interpreted as a signal of a
soon downturn of the US economy, which could encourage the Fed to remain
passive, weakening the US dollar. As a result, the [EURUSD][2]  was
rising during two consecutive trading sessions in the week ended July 9,
despite the contradictory dynamics of the stock market. At first, the
[S&P 500][3] and Treasury yields fell, then rallied, but this did not
prevent the euro from strengthening against the greenback.

A new reason to buy the [EURUSD][2] could be the forecast for a decline
in the US inflation from 5% to 4.9% in June. Some analysts suggest this
scenario fits in the scheme of the temporary surge in US inflation. If
so, the Fed could continue its wait-and-see [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). However, most of the
64 Wall Street Journal experts believe that high CPI values will be
long-lasting. They forecast core inflation at 3.2% by the end of 2021.
In 2022-2023, the indicator will slow down to 2.3%, but its average
value in 2021-2023 will be 2.58%. This is the highest level since the
1990s, so the Fed can well start monetary tightening.

The reality could be different. Nordea Markets notes that rent accounts
for about 40% in the structure of the consumer price index. The
indicator is lagging behind the home sales prices and should soar in
Autumn.

A suppose the [EURUSD][2] could start consolidation after a drop having
occurred since late May. Among the reasons, there are negative for carry
traders [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) about a downturn in global growth and volatility surges
amid the holiday season. Traders exit speculative trades, start selling
the high-yielding emerging markets currencies and buying funding
currencies, such as the yen and the euro. Therefore, the euro could be
corrected up in the downtrend.

### Weekly [EURUSD][2] trading plan

Nonetheless, the general scenario will hardly change. The Fed is to
announce the QE tapering in August-September already. The further
inflation growth and the recovery of employment due to the expiration of
stimulus checks will encourage the aggressiveness of the US central
bank. In the short term, if the [EURUSD][2] breaks out the resistance at
1.188, it should continue the rally up to 1.193 and 1.1965, where one
could look for a sell signal. Otherwise, if the price doesn’t go up
above 1.188, it will be relevant to enter shorts right away.
