Gold is gaining ground. Forecast as of 12.07.2021Dmitri Demidenko

A typical situation in the market: sometimes everything falls out of
hand, and then you get up, shake off the dust and begin to recover. Gold
turned out to be in a similar situation in the middle of summer. Let us
discuss the Forex outlook and make up a gold trading plan

## Fundamental gold forecast for a week

The more chances that the global economic recovery will be difficult,
the better it is for the [XAUUSD][1] bulls. After the disastrous June,
which became the worst month for the precious metal in the last 4.5
years, XAU is gradually coming to its senses. Gold managed to post a
3-week rally amid concerns about the spread of the Delta variant across
the planet and related fears about a slower return of global GDP to the
trend than previously expected.

### Weekly gold dynamics

Gold was seriously affected due to the Fed's intention to start
normalizing monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) sooner rather than later. The situation is
very similar to 2013's one with Ben Bernanke's statement about the QE
tapering, which provoked a taper tantrum, and the gold bearish trend. To
the delight of the [XAUUSD][1] bulls, unlike the events of eight years
ago, currently, the US Treasury bonds yield is not growing rapidly, but
on the contrary, it is decreasing, unexpectedly for many [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s.

The drop in 10-year Treasury rates from 1.77% at the end of March to
1.25% in July looks surprising. It is strange when [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s get rid of
securities against the background of the worst first quarter in the last
40 years and when they are actively buying securities in the face of US
GDP rapid growth. This is all due to the Delta variant of COVID-19,
disappointing US data, and the exiting of short trades formed at the
beginning of the year. The return of 10-year Treasury yields to their
lowest levels since mid-February is a good sign for the precious metal.

According to SaxoBank, gold has significant growth potential. XAU will
be able to fulfill it if the global economic recovery does not go as
expected, or inflation continues to accelerate. In the current
environment, gold is an excellent choice for portfolio diversification,
not only for asset managers but also for central banks. HSBC expects
their purchases to increase substantially in 2021-2022, which will
support the [XAUUSD][1] bulls.

Citi analysts predict that gold futures prices will tend to fall this
summer, but will not collapse. The company expects that in 2022 the
average gold price will be $1,760 per ounce.

In my opinion, in the short term, due to fears for the fate of the world
economy because of the delta coronavirus variant, gold has the
opportunity to grow and regain some of the positions it lost in June. In
the second half of the summer, the gold downtrend is likely to occur.
The reason is the future start of the Fed's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
normalization, as Jerome Powell will report in Jackson Hole in August.

### Weekly gold trading plan

A short-term breakout of resistance at $1815 per ounce will increase the
risks of a continued gold rally in the direction of $1830 and $1850. At
the same time, if the gold price will break out the support at $1,795,
then the prices will fall to $1,760 and below.
