Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 12.07.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

The BTCUSD and the XRPUSD are forming double zigzags, whose middle legs
are unfolding as triple zigzags. The ETHUSD is forming a simple bullish
zigzag.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

After the impulse down wave [A] had completed, the market started
forming a corrective pattern as a double zigzag (W)-(X)-(Y). There have
completed the motive wave (W) and the linking wave (X) is still
developing. Wave (X) is likely to be a triple zigzag W-X-Y-X-Z. Within
the triple zigzag, the second linking wave X is about to end. Therefore,
the price could soon start declining in the Z wave towards a level of
31800.00. At this level, the (X) wave will be 61.8% of the (W),
according to the Fibonacci retracements.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Sell 34406.50, TP 31800.00

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

After the descending motive wave (W) completed, the market has started
forming an ascending double zigzag. This zigzag must have completed by
50% so far, as the bullish zigzag-shaped wave W has formed and the
descending linking wave X should soon end. Wave X has a complex
structure, it looks like a triple zigzag [W]-[X]-[Y]-[X]-[Z]. The price
should be declining in the final sub-wave [Z] to a level of 0.560, where
the X wave will be 76.4% of wave W.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] **** today:

Sell 0.644, TP 0.560

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

The ETHUSD market completed the descending impulse wave A. There is now
developing a new bullish zigzag [A]-[B]-[C]. Sub-wave [A], composed of
sub-waves (1)-(2)-(3)-(4)-(5), has completed. There is forming the
bearish correction [B], which could have a simple structure of a zigzag
(A)-(B)-(C). Therefore, a short correction (B) should end soon, and the
market will be moving in wave (C) to a level of 1960.00. At this level,
wave [B] will be 61.8% of wave [A].

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Sell 2160.35, TP 1960.00
