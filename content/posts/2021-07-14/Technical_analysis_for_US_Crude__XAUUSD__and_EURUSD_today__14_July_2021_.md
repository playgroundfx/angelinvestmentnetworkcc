Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 14.07.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

Yesterday, the pattern to sell the euro in the Intermediary Zone 1.1878
- 1.1869 yielded profits.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

On July 9, the short-term oil trend reversed up. Since then, the upper
Target Zone 76.10 - 75.57 has been a target for purchases. The local
high was updated yesterday. Thus, the Additional Zone 72.93 - 72.80
yielded profits.

Today it is necessary to set new support zones. The Micro-zone is at
levels 74.27 - 74.20, and the Additional Zone is located in the zone of
73.60 - 73.47. When the price corrects to these marginal zones, it is
profitable to look for new purchases according to the patterns with
targets at the local high and the Target Zone.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

  1. Open buy positions according to the pattern in 74.27 - 74.06. TakeProfit: 74.92, Target Zone 76.10 - 75.57. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. Buy according to the pattern in Additional Zone 73.60 - 73.47. TakeProfit: 74.92, Target Zone 76.10 - 75.57. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

Gold sellers were unable to break out the key support level of 1794,
which is located within the Intermediary Zone 1795 - 1794. The short-
term trend remained up. The target in the uptrend is to update the July
8 high and break out the Gold Zone 1820 - 1818.

If the Gold Zone is broken out, then the next target will be Target Zone
2 1845 - 1840. In this case, rearrange the Additional and Intermediary
zones and look for new purchases at them.

At the moment, it is profitable according to the methodology to hold
purchases entered on July 12 according to the “false breakout” pattern.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

Hold up purchases according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 1795 -
1793. TakeProfit: 1818. StopLoss: at the breakeven.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

Yesterday, the pattern to sell the euro in the Intermediary Zone 1.1878
- 1.1869 yielded profits. As a result, the July 7 low was updated and
the Target Zone 1.1800 - 1.1781 was retested. Until the Target Zone is
broken out downside with consolidation, it is too early to talk about
further price fall. But one can expect a correction to the Additional or
Intermediary Zone.

The Additional Zone is located at levels 1.1820 - 1.1816 and serves as a
strong resistance level. After its test, look for new euro sales
according to the pattern. The target will be today's low.

If the Additional Zone is broken out, then it will be possible to
consider purchases in correction with the target at the Intermediary
Zone 1.1868 - 1.1860.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

Sell according to the pattern in Additional Zone 1.1820 - 1.1816.
TakeProfit: 1.1774. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.
