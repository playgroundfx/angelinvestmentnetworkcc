Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 14.07.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

The ETHUSD and BTCUSD have finished forming down waves, so the prices
should soon start rising.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

The BTCUSD must be forming a bullish double zigzag (W)-(X)-(Y). The
first motive wave (W) has completed. The linking wave (X) may have
completed as a triple zigzag; it retraced wave (W) by 61.8%. Therefore,
the Bitcoin price should soon start rising in sub-wave (Y) to level
above the high of 36640.00, marked by wave (W).

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 31913.25, TP 36640.00

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

The XRPUSD market should continue forming the bullish double zigzag
W-X-Y. The linking wave is currently unfolding as a triple zigzag
[W]-[X]-[Y]-[X]-[Z]. The Ripple price should continue declining to a
level of 0.560, where wave X will retrace the W wave by 76.4%. Next, the
market will turn up and start rising in the final wave Y.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] **** today:

Sell 0.596, TP 0.560

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

The ETHUSD must be forming the bullish corrective wave B as a simple
zigzag [A]-[B]-[C]. The descending correction [B] may have completed; it
retraced wave [A] by 76.4%. Therefore, the Ethereum price should soon
start rising in wave [C] to a level above the high of 2407.00, marked by
wave [A].

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Buy 1886.68, TP 2407.00
