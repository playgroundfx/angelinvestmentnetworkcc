Greenback narrows the gap. Forecast as of 14.07.2021Dmitri Demidenko

Even though the Bank of Canada's rate of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) normalization
is faster than that of the Fed, the [USDCAD][1] price is growing. How
have the pair been influenced by the fact that the Fed has accelerated
and can do it again? Let us discuss the Forex outlook and make up a
trading plan for [USDCAD][1] and [EURCAD][2]

## Monthly Canadian dollar fundamental forecast

Looking at how well things are going in Canada, one can only wonder why
the loonie is not building up its advantage against the major world
currencies? The Canadian dollar continues to lead the G10 performance
race, but has weakened by 2.7% against the USD over the past month. The
gap is rapidly closing, which looks odd against the backdrop of a
bullish oil market, record-high commodity prices, business sentiment and
consumer confidence in Canada.

The territorial factor and close ties with the United States allow
Ottawa to benefit from the rapid growth of the US economy. The OECD
estimates that Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion fiscal stimulus will expand
Canada's GDP by 0.5 pps over 12 months. US imports from Canada in
January-May increased by 29% compared to 2020 and by 5% compared to
2019. The Canadian market is likely to fully recover from the recession
in the third quarter of this year, which, against the backdrop of
rapidly growing inflation, allows the BoC to normalize monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).

At the July 14 meeting, Tiff Macklem and his colleagues are likely to
scale back QE asset purchases from CA$3 trillion to CA$2 trillion per
week. Until the end of 2021, Bloomberg experts expect further withdrawal
of monetary stimulus in the form of a fall in QE program volumes to CA$1
trillion per week. Since the start of the pandemic, the Bank of Canada
has bought up CA$320 billion in sovereign debt. A slowdown in its
balance sheet growth should support the loonie.

The [USDCAD][1] rally looks surprising due to the fact that the
derivatives market expecting four overnight rate hikes by the end of
2022 and only two acts of monetary restriction by the Fed over the same
period. The speed of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) normalization in Ottawa is clearly
higher than in Washington. However, the gap between loonie and greenback
is rapidly shrinking. What is the reason?

To my mind, the USDCAD bulls are trading the factor of surprise. Unlike
the Bank of Canada, which has already scaled back QE twice in October
and April, the Fed's withdrawal from its wait-and-see approach came as a
real surprise. The massive exits of short US dollar trades led to a
[USDCAD][1] rise.

### Monthly [USDCAD][1] and [EURCAD][2] trading plan

In my opinion, a reversal of the long-term downtrend will be possible if
the Fed starts to act very aggressively and (or) the BoC, for no reason
at all, begins to delay the start of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) normalization. The
chances of the first option look preferable. I expect [USDCAD][1] to
consolidate in the range of 1.23-1.275 and stand for sales on growth or
purchases on a price decline. You would better trade divergence in
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) entering [EURCAD][2] shorts with the target at 1.45. The
inability of the bulls to consolidate the price above 1.48 is a sign of
their weakness and good [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) for loonie buyers.
