Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 02.08.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

The oil price is being corrected down in the short-term uptrend.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

Oil is being corrected down in the short-term uptrend. Traders are
testing the Additional Zone 72.51 – 72.38. Look for a pattern to buy oil
with a target at 73.80.

If the Additional Zone is broken out, the correction will continue down
to the target at the Intermediary Zone 71.15 – 70.88. The trend border
is in the Intermediary Zone.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

Buy according to the pattern in Additional Zone 72.51 - 72.38.
TakeProfit: 73.80. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

Last Friday, the gold price crashed and reached the Intermediary Zone.
Nonetheless, the short-term trend remains up. The Intermediary Zone is
the trend border. Today, it is relevant to enter gold purchases
according to the pattern with a target at the high of last week, around
level 1831.

If the price breaks out the Intermediary Zone and consolidates below,
the short-term trend will turn down. In this case, it will be relevant
to sell gold with targets at level 1794 and Target Zone 1787 — 1783.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

Buy according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 1810 - 1807.
TakeProfit: 1831. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

The euro has been traded in the correction since last Friday. The price
has reached the Additional Zone as a part of the correction. The
Additional Zone is being held up by the buyers, but there is no buy
signal. Continue monitoring the market and looking for buy entries
according to the pattern with a target at the high of last week.

If the Additional Zone is broken out, the price should go towards the
Intermediary Zone 1.1820 – 1.1811. The Intermediary Zone is the border
of the short-term uptrend, so, it is also relevant to enter buy trades
in the IZ with a target at the high of last week.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

Buy according to the pattern in Additional Zone 1.1864 - 1.1860.
TakeProfit: 1.1905. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.
