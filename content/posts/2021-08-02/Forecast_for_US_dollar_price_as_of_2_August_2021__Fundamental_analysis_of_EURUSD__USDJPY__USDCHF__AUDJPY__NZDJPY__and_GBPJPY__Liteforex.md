Forex in August: the market is losing its appetite. Forecast for EURUSD,
USDJPY, USDCHF, AUDJPY, NZDJPY, and G...Dmitri Demidenko

When US stock indexes are lingering near all-time highs and market
liquidity decreases, pullbacks are likelier to occur. How will it affect
[EURUSD][1], [USDJPY][2], [USDCHF][3], [AUDJPY][4], [NZDJPY][5], and
[GBPJPY][6]? Let’s check it out and make a trading plan.

## Monthly fundamental forecast for G10 currencies

Financial markets stepped into August, still wondering if a spike in
inflation was temporary and the US economy would begin slowing down.
Either question is critical to the US dollar and the whole Forex market.
At the same time, lack of liquidity and volatility hikes associated with
the holidays season set the global appetite for risk at stake. Thus,
high-yield currencies would most often close in the red zone and haven
assets -- in the green zone at the end of summer.

From 1975 to 2020, the Australian dollar and the NZ dollar were the main
outsiders in August -- they fell in 28 and 29 cases out of 46,
respectively. The British pound, which is sensitive to risk as well,
would go negative in 30 cases. When demand for high-yield assets is
high, it's easier for Great Britain to drain capital and improve its
current account, which is beneficial to the pound.

On the contrary, such haven assets as the Japanese yen and the Swiss
frank felt at home. They consolidated in 27 and 26 cases out of 46 and
belong to the three G10 currencies whose average and median values are
in the green zone.

The third currency on that list is the euro that uses its status of a
funding currency to make profits amid a lower global appetite for risk.

The NZ dollar would lose 3.2% of its value on unfavorable streaks, the
Australian dollar -- 2.4%, and the pound -- 1.9%. The yen consolidated
by 2% and the franc -- by 1.8%.

I want to note that the losing streak has already been too long in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)
of statistical analysis. It has lasted for over three months, which I
see for the first time in 8 years of work. Thus, I suggest checking out
seasonal price movements of the G10 currencies, depending on the
availability of certain conditions. We can use the dynamics of US stock
indexes as they are traditionally seen as indicators of [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s'
appetite for risk.

The [S&P 500][7] is currently near its all-time highs, and deep
corrections are unlikely to happen when there's much money in the
system. On the other hand, the market may have lost liquidity due to the
holidays season. As a result, any bad [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) may lead to drastic falls.
The US stock market's pullback is a weighty argument for selling
[AUDJPY][4], [NZDJPY][5], and [GBPJPY][6].

A slowdown in the US labor market, inflation, and economy is fraught
with falling treasury yields and a plunge of [USDCHF][3] and [USDJPY][2]
quotes. History says that [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s don't react to tapering asset
purchases under the QE program but to changes on the Fed's balance
sheet. Primary dealers expect it to have grown by $1.345 trillion to
$8.848 trillion by the end of 2022.

When it comes to the [EURUSD][1], I expect that after storms in June and
July, the pair will consolidate in a range whose limits will be defined
shortly.
