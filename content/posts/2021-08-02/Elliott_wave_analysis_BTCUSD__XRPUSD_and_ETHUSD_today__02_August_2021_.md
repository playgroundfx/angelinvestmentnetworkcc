Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 02.08.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

The XRPUSD and BTCUSD should be forming the initial parts of bearish
impulses, so the prices should be declining.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

The BTCUSD market must have completed the corrective wave [B] as a
double zigzag (W)-(X)-(Y). In the most recent chart section, the price
is going down in the initial part of the new bearish wave. There should
be unfolding an impulse wave. The first sub-wave (1) seems to have
completed as an impulse, and the price should rise a little in
correction (2). After the correction completes, the market will resume
declining to a level below 38200.00, marked by the corrective wave [4].

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Sell 39843.50, TP 38200.00

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

The XRPUSD must have completed the linking wave (X) as a flat.
Therefore, there is developing the initial part of the new bearish
impulse wave. Sub-wave [1] could end at a level of around the previous
low of 0.695. Next, the price will go up a little in correction [2]. One
could enter sell trades in the current situation.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] **** today:

Sell 0.727, TP 0.695

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

The ETHUSD market is forming the upward corrective wave B as a simple
zigzag composed of the sub-waves [A]-[B]-[C]. There should be unfolding
the final sub-wave (5), the element of the [C] impulse, which could
conclude the entire pattern at a level of 2700.00. Once the price
reaches the level, the market should turn down and start declining. One
could consider buy trades in the current situation.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Buy 2564.03, TP 2700.00
