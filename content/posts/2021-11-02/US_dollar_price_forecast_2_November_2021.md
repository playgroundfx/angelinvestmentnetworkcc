Dollar and others. Forecast as of 02.11.2021Dmitri Demidenko

Actions of some central banks have been already priced in the rates of
their local currencies. Other regulators do not signal monetary
normalization, which they are expected to do. How this fact will affect
the [EURUSD][1]. Let us discuss the Forex outlook and make up a trading
plan.

## Weekly US dollar fundamental forecast

Dollar and all the others. A giant shift takes place in the monetary
policies of central banks. Bank of America estimates the world's central
banks poured about $23 trillion into the financial system to help the
global economy fight the recession. Now, it is time to start tapering
the stimulus. The foreign exchange rates will depend on the action of
the Fed and other central banks. The Bank of Canada is to quit the QE,
the Reserve Bank of Australia is unwilling to maintain the 3-year bond
yield at 0.1%, and the Bank of England is to raise the interest rate.
These factors support the CAD, the AUD, the GBP, and other G10
currencies, including the euro.

Narrowing, inflation, tightening. It is in this mode that the world
economy and financial markets operate. The world's leading central banks
will eventually unwind their bond purchases. Furthermore, if inflation
remains high, the world's central banks will have to raise interest
rates and, perhaps, more aggressively than currently expected. And
markets are betting on the central banks whose potential of monetary
tightening is underestimated. It may not be the Fed. Everything is clear
and transparent in the US. Investors expect tapering of the QE from
November 2021 to mid-2022 and two rate hikes next year. And the BoE
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) also seems to be predictable. The BoE is expected to
raise the interest rate by 100 basis points in 2021-2022. Conversely,
the Reserve Bank of Australia is likely to backtrack from its mantra of
raising the cash rate in 2024. The ECB can do the same. This
circumstance supports the AUD and encourages the euro bulls to go ahead.

Central banks' monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) is reflected in the bond markets.
Previously, central banks affected bond markets; now, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s in bonds
test them for strength. Will the RBA refuse to hold the 3-year bond
yield at 0.1%? Will Christine Lagarde dissuade the markets? Will the Fed
hinder economic growth by tapering the QE and raising the rates? Based
on the flattening of the US bond yield curve, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are concerned
about the questions mentioned above.

### Dynamics of US bond yield curve

After all, a decline in 10-year yields may result from the Treasury's
intention to reduce the volume of bond issues. According to several Wall
Street banks, sales of regular coupon-bearing debt will be pared back by
some $1 trillion by about the third quarter of 2022. Treasury Secretary
Janet Yellen is not worried about signals sent by the bond market. She
claims there is a good, reliable recovery in the US economy, which is
not at all similar to the recovery after 2008 because currently, the
unemployment rate has dropped significantly.

### Weekly [EURUSD][1] trading plan

If the lawmakers are not concerned about the risks of the US GDP
downturn, also because of the Fed's monetary normalization, why should
ordinary traders care? It should be taken for granted, and [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s
should focus on the outcomes of the FOMC meeting and US jobs report.
Although the [EURUSD][1] bulls seem to be willing to go ahead, the
hawkish tone of the Fed officials and strong US jobs report should
discourage the euro buyers. If the price rebounds from the resistance
levels of 1.16, 1.1615, and 1.1635, it will be relevant to sell the
pair.
