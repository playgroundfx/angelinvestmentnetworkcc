Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 02.11.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

Small impulse waves should be developing for all cryptocurrencies
covered in the article.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

The BTCUSD market is forming the final part of corrective wave [B]
composed of three sub-waves, two of which have been completed, and you
cannot see them in the chart. There is developing the final upward wave
(C) as a bullish impulse 1-2-3-4-5. Correction 4 is currently forming as
a triple zigzag [W]-[X]-[Y]-[X]-[Z], which should soon be concluded by
sub-wave [Z]. The Bitcoin price should be declining in the impulse wave
(C) of a smaller degree to a level of 57240.00, where wave [Z] will be
76.4% of wave [Y].

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Sell 61531.00, TP 57240.00

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

The XRPUSD market is forming the linking wave X as a triple zigzag. The
first four sub-waves of this large corrective trend have finished. The
final motive wave [Z] is still developing as a zigzag (A)-(B)-(C).
Impulse (A) and correction (B) have been completed, and the final
impulse wave (С) has just started developing. The Ripple price should be
rising in impulse (C) to a level of 1.157, as outlined in the chart.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] **** today:

Buy 1.095, TP 1.157

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

Like the BTCUSD, the ETHUSD market is forming corrective wave B, with
the final leg, impulse [C], unfolding inside. Impulse [C] is composed of
five sub-waves (1)-(2)-(3)-(4)-(5). Correction (4) is currently
unfolding, likely, as an expanding triangle A-B-C-D-E. The Ethereum
price should be declining in the [C] impulse of a smaller degree to a
level of 3882.00, which is the support level where sub-wave C finished.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Sell 4358.70, TP 3882.00
