##  **Elliott wave forecast for BTCUSD, ETHUSD, XRPUSD for today**

###  **Elliott wave[BTCUSD][1] analysis**

 **![LiteForex: Elliott wave cryptocurrency forecast today. Elliott wave
analysis Bitcoin, Ripple, Ethereum][2]**

The BTCUSD market is currently forming the bullish impulse wave A, with
the sideways correction (4) of [5] completed as a triple three inside.
Next, the price started rising smoothly forming the final wave (5) that
may complete as a simple impulse 1-2-3-4-5. In the next few weeks, the
market should be rising in sub-waves 3-4-5 to a level of around 12600.

###  **Elliott wave[XRPUSD][3] analysis**

 **![LiteForex: Elliott wave cryptocurrency forecast today. Elliott wave
analysis Bitcoin, Ripple, Ethereum][4]**

The XRPUSD market is forming the global linking wave [X] as a simple
zigzag (A)-(B)-(C). The corrective wave (B) ended, and the bullish
impulse wave (C) is now forming. Within the (C) wave, the sideways
correction 4 has completed as a triple three. The market is now
following the beginning of the final wave 5 that may complete as a
simple impulse. Therefore, the price should be rising in the sub-waves
[3]-[4]-[5] to a level of 0.348, as it is outlined in the chart.

###  **Elliott wave[ETHUSD][5] analysis**

The ETHUSD market continues forming the global linking wave [X] as a
double zigzag. The chart displays the final leg of the (Y) wave that is
the simple zigzag A-B-C. The down correction 4 completed as a zigzag
with the C impulse currently unfolding. There is now developing the
final bullish wave [5]. Presumably, the price should be rising in waves
3-4-5 towards a level of 500.00, as it is outlined in the chart.
