EUR/USD forecast: Euro is scared of heightsDmitri Demidenko

## Fundamental Euro forecast for today

### Isn’t EUR/USD trading too high?

The Forex market is always changing! In winter, the [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) about progress
in the US-China would strengthen the euro. In spring, the US stock
market rally would support the [EUR/USD][1] bulls. At the end of summer,
however, the euro isn’t rising amid the US optimistic announcements
about making a deal with China. It isn’t rising although the [S&P500][2]
has hit a fresh high on the [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) about the accelerated approval of
vaccines and the use of blood plasma to treat critically ill COVID-19
patients. Isn’t the euro trading too high?

Although Donald Trump claims he does not want to talk with China and
does not rule out a complete break in relations with this country, US
and Chinese officials discussed the status of the trade deal. Chinese
Vice-Premier Liu He spoke with US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer
and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to discuss further action needed
to make progress on the trade deal. Such a tone suggests the White House
still wants to reach an agreement with China.

Beijing has fallen behind its first-year commitment. Nonetheless, the
recovery of China’s economy, growing domestic demand, and the
unwillingness to inflame tensions with Washington suggest that there
won’t be a new round of trade wars.

Donald Trump doesn’t want to resume the trade battle ahead of the US
presidential election. Joe Biden has already accused him of the failure
of his [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) with Beijing, so he wouldn’t give his opponent another
reason for criticism. China doesn’t want new tariffs. China’s economy,
unlike most advanced economies, will expand in 2020. JP Morgan increased
the forecast for the Chinese GDP in 2020 from 1.3% to 2.5%. The US GDP,
for example, should contract by 8% this year.

The continuous rise of the US stock indexes and progress in US-China
trade relations supported Trump’s approval ratings, which could be a
reason for the [EUR/USD][1] correction. What is good for Trump is good
for the US dollar.

But still, the primary reason for the euro drawdown is likely to be the
second wave of the pandemic in Europe. The ratio of the COVID-19 cases
in Europe and the US peaked in early August, but the situation has
changed since then.

If the [EUR/USD][1] breaks out supports at 1.178 and 1.1755 could
suggest entering short-term sell trades. One should not hold the shorts
for too long, in my opinion. Many euro’s growth drivers still work out,
and the deterioration of the euro-area epidemiological situation will
hardly last for a long time.
