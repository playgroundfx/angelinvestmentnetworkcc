USDCHF. Fundamental and technical analysis. Medium-term forecastMikhail
Hypov

##  **USDCHF: fundamental analysis, coronavirus impact on economy,
channel and trend analysis, frontal volume analysis.**

Today we are analysing the [USDCHF][1] pair. There’s always much
information on the US dollar, but the Swiss franc isn’t given much
“coverage” for some reasons. I’m often asked which a better investment
is: dollars or euro, but the Swiss franc is rarely considered as an
investment currency.

 **Fundamental analysis**

Many advanced households use CHF (from Latin, “Confoederatio Helvetica
Franc”) as a base currency for saving money and avoiding risks.   Demand
for the Swiss franc grew so much that the Swiss National Bank introduced
a zero rate in August 2011 to prevent the franc from getting too
expensive. In December 2014, the rate becomes negative 0.25%. Next
month, the SNB drops it to negative 0.75% and the rate becomes the
lowest official rate in the world. Not a single time has this value
changed since then. There’s another important [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) fact to
mention: from 2011 to 2015 the franc was pegged to the euro with the
upper limit set at 1.20 ЕUR/CHF.

scenario for the next two months][2]

During that period the euro faced 2 big falls against the USD. They are
marked with red arrows in the chart above. To keep the EUR/CHF rate in a
fixed range, the Swiss bank had to sell huge amounts of the national
currency, up to 1 billion francs a day.  Finally, the SNB introduced the
record low rate of -0.75 and abandoned strict [regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/) of the national
currency.

scenario for the next two months][3]

That decision resulted in a sharp fall of the euro against the Swiss
franc. The franc consolidated 20% in January alone. That event would be
called “currency shock” later. Because the franc got more expensive,
exports were affected. Machine-building, electrotechnical,
metallurgical, textile and tourist sectors faced staff reduction.
Swiss enterprises became less efficient and domestic production costs
grew as compared to the closest European competitors.

The rise in the franc’s cost made it even more attractive for [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s
as a safe haven currency. So, the demand grew even bigger. On the other
hand, the negative rate made credits more accessible to businesses,
which smoothed the currency shock for the economy. Also, accessible
credits stimulated CHF investments outside the country. Every second
franc is earned abroad.

Let’s analyse the current situation now.

Impact of COVID-19 on Swiss economy

![LiteForex: Fundamental / technical analysis of USDCHF and actual
scenario for the next two months][4]

As we can see in the chart above, the number of new coronavirus cases is
decreasing and the total number of cases is at around 1,000 people. In
the first place, Switzerland has been combatting coronavirus through a
2-month quarantine period, which cost the country’s economy 100 billion
CHF approximately.  The peculiarity of the Swiss situation is that the
global economic crisis raised the demand for CHF as a safe haven
currency worldwide. As a result, the SNB had to implement [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) currency
interventions for holding a rate growth back in lieu of helping the
economy through direct investments.

The economy of Switzerland is export-oriented and 50% of production goes
abroad.  So, the main current economic threat is consolidation of CHF.

scenario for the next two months][5]

On 11 May, quarantine measures were softened. Borders to all
neighbouring countries except Italy reopened. Businesses, public
transport, cafés, restaurants and entertainments started working again.
But the consequences of quarantine and global crisis continue affecting
the economy. As of 12th May, State Secretariat for Economic Affairs
received 189,000 requests from companies to reduce the working hours for
1,931,000 people with a proportional cut in wages. It’s a big number of
people for Switzerland: 21.6% of the whole population including retired
people and minors. The number of the unemployed grew from 2.6% to 3.2%.
These are leading indicators which will affect the economic welfare of
Switzerland in the nearest future for certain.

Economists estimate that an economic slowdown will be 6-7% this year if
the rate is maintained at the current level. Obviously, the primordial
task of the SNB is to not allow the franc to consolidate against other
currencies. To perform the task, the bank has big reserves of 800
billion CHF.

###  **Technical analysis**

![LiteForex: Fundamental / technical analysis of USDCHF and actual
scenario for the next two months][6]

From 2000 and up to March 2014, [USDCHF][1] was in a sideways bearish
channel. It means the franc grew more expensive against the US dollar
(see the chart above). The steps taken by the Swiss bank allowed
breaking that trend and switching to a global sideways trend.

![LiteForex: Fundamental / technical analysis of USDCHF and actual
scenario for the next two months][7]

After the currency shock, the pair has been trading in a narrow range
since 2015 (weekly chart above). The frontal volume indicator shows that
the franc is actively trading at around 0.99 CHF for 1 USD. The [lower
limit][1] is at 0.91.

I can say for sure that the rate will continue moving within that range.

###  **Actual scenario**

![LiteForex: Fundamental / technical analysis of USDCHF and actual
scenario for the next two months][8]

We see in the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) chart above that a local bearish trend formed in the
range of [0.91 - 1][1]. The pair is consolidating within this range.
Most likely, there will be a downward exit from the triangle, based on
the macroeconomic peculiarities of Switzerland and the USA. Opening
short positions from the current levels is quite a secure decision
because there are big accumulated volumes near the [USDCHF][1] parity.
Profits can be fixed with every reason outside the parity zone. Targets
are quite clear too: the lower limit of the channel at [0.91 - 0.92][1].
Most likely, the SNB won’t allow the franc to consolidate below this
limit. So, we can fix profits when the rate has approached this limit,
and play against the Swiss national currency. There may be a false
upward exit from the triangle too. But according to technical analysis,
bulls won’t move further running into the upper limit of the trading
channel  at 0.98 and bearish volumes at [0.99][1]. So if such a surprise
occurs, there will be a good opportunity for averaging into the
position.
