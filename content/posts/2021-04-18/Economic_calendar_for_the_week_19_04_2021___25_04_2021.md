Economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the week 19.04.2021 – 25.04.2021Jana Kane

##  **Review of the main events of the Forex economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the
next trading week (19.04.2021 – 25.04.2021)**

 **Trading on key Forex [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/): next week we expect the publication of
important macro statistics from the UK, Eurozone, New Zealand, the US,
Germany, Australia, as well as the results of meetings of the central
banks of Canada and the Eurozone.**

The dollar fell again last week, while the DXY dollar index lost another
0.7% declining for the second week in a row. It looks like the positive
factors of fiscal stimulus and relatively high rates of vaccination in
the US are already largely priced in the quotations of the dollar, which
needs new drivers to resume growth. There aren't any at the moment.

It is obvious that strong US economic data can no longer support the US
dollar, which is more responsive to the dynamics of US government bonds
than to macro statistics. And their profitability has been declining for
the second week in a row.

At the same time, despite the high rates of vaccination, the coronavirus
situation in the United States remains tense.

Last Wednesday, the Fed Chairman Jerome Powell again tried to calm
market participants worried about rising inflation in the United States.
Powell said that long before the Fed considers raising interest rates,
the central bank will begin to cut back on monthly asset purchases. As
previously promised by Powell, the Fed will also warn financial market
participants in advance.

Next week, financial market participants will pay attention to the
publication of important macro statistics from the UK, Eurozone, New
Zealand, the US, Germany, Australia, as well as the results of the
meetings of the central banks of Canada and the Eurozone.

 **Traders should pay attention to the publication of the following
macro indicators:**

 ***during the coming week, new events may be added to the [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) and
/ or some scheduled events may be canceled**

 ****GMT time**

###  **Monday, April 19**

No important macro statistics planned to be released.

###  **Tuesday, April 20**

###  **01:30 CNY The People's Bank of China interest rate decision**

Since May 2012, the People's Bank of China has been steadily cutting
interest rates in support of Chinese manufacturers. The bank last
lowered the rate in April 2020 (by 0.20% to 3.85% at the moment).

In 2020, in the context of international trade conflicts and a slowdown
in the global economy, the world's largest central banks took the path
of easing their monetary policies in order to support national economies
and increase the competitiveness of goods exported from these countries.

The People's Bank of China is also in line with this process. The
depreciation of the yuan has become especially relevant in the last 2
years, when the confrontation between the two most powerful economies in
the world began. One of the measures to mitigate the negative
consequences of increased duties on the import of Chinese goods into the
United States was the depreciation of the national currency of China.
This measure was intended, among other things, to maintain the same
volumes of imports of Chinese products to the United States, which would
cost American buyers less due to the difference in the rates of the
national currencies of the United States and China.

The coronavirus has become an additional strong negative factor.

Probably, at this meeting, the People's Bank of China will keep the
interest rate at the same level of 3.85%, although a rate cut is also
possible.

Nevertheless, if the People's Bank of China makes unexpected statements
or decisions, volatility may increase in the entire financial market.
Investors will also be interested in the bank's assessment of the
consequences of the coronavirus for the Chinese economy and its [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
in the near future in this regard.

###  **01:30 AUD Minutes of the April meeting of the Reserve Bank of
Australia**

This document is published two weeks after the meeting and the decision
on the interest rate. If the RBA positively assesses the state of the
labor market in the country, the rate of GDP growth, and also shows a
hawkish attitude towards the inflation forecast in the economy, the
markets regard this as a higher probability of a rate hike at the next
meeting, which is a positive factor for the AUD. The bank's soft
rhetoric regarding above all inflation puts pressure on the AUD.

During the last meeting, the RBA kept the key interest rate and the
target level of yield on three-year government bonds unchanged at around
0.10%. Central bank officials have confirmed that interest rates are
unlikely to be raised until 2024.

"The RBA management will not raise rates until inflation stabilizes in
the range of 2-3%. This requires a significant acceleration of wage
growth compared to current rates," said the RBA Governor Philip Lowe in
his statement.

"Achieving this goal will require significant growth in employment and a
reduction in free resources in the labor market. The RBA expects that
these conditions will not be met until at least 2024," Lowe said.

Market participants also believe that the RBA will not raise interest
rates until 2024. Wages continue to rise slowly and household debt has
risen to an all-time high, which also puts higher interest rates in the
longer term.

According to Philip Lowe, "there is no serious argument in favor of
tightening monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) in the short term." In his opinion, "some
time will pass before interest rates are raised."

Nevertheless, if the published minutes contain unexpected information
regarding the issues of the RBA's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), the volatility in the
AUD quotes will increase.

###  **06:00 GBP Report on the average wages of the British for the last
3 months. Unemployment rate**

On a monthly basis, the UK National Statistics Office (ONS) publishes a
report on average wages covering the last 3 months, with and without
bonuses.

This report is a key short-term indicator of the dynamics of changes in
the level of wages of employees in the UK. Wages growth is positive for
the GBP, while a low value is negative. Forecast: the April report
suggests that the average wages with bonuses increased over the last
calculated 3 months (December-February) by +4.8% (against +4.8%, +4.7%,
+3.7% , +2.8%, +1.3%, +0.1% in previous periods); without bonuses -
increased by +4.2% (against +4.2%, +4.1%, +3.6%, +2.8%, +1.9%, +0.9%,
+0.2% in previous periods). Thus, the expected data is close to the
average values ​​of the indicators. They also point to the growing
dynamics of the level of wages, which is a positive factor for the
pound, as it contributes to the growth of inflationary pressures. If the
data turns out to be better than forecast, the pound is likely to
strengthen in the foreign exchange market. Data worse than forecast will
negatively affect the pound in the short term.

Also at this time, data on unemployment in the UK are published. It is
expected that in the 3 months from December to February, unemployment
was at the level of 5.2% (against 5.0%, 5.1%, 5.0%, 4.9%, 4.8%, 4.5%,
4.3%, 3.9%, 3.9% in previous periods). Since 2012, the UK unemployment
rate has declined steadily (from 8.0% in September 2012). This is a
positive factor for the pound, the rise in unemployment is a negative
factor.

If the data from the UK labor market turn out to be worse than the
forecast and / or the previous value, the pound will be under pressure.

In any case, at the time of the publication of data from the British
labor market, an increase in volatility in the pound quotes and on the
London Stock Exchange is expected.

###  **08:00 EUR The Euro Area Bank Lending Survey**

The survey by the EU financial experts on the state of the bank lending
system is conducted 4 times a year. The main purpose of the survey is to
obtain expanded information on the conditions of bank lending in the
Eurozone.

The obtained data are used by the ECB management when making decisions
on the bank's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). This report may cause increased
volatility in the euro quotes and on the European stock market at the
time of its publication if it contains unexpected conclusions regarding
the [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of lending to businesses and households in the Eurozone.

###  **22:45 NZD CPI (Consumer Price Index) for the 1st quarter**

Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a key indicator for assessing inflation
and reflects the dynamics of retail prices for a group of goods and
services that make up the consumer basket. A positive result strengthens
the NZD, a negative one weakens it. Previous CPI values (YoY): +1.4% in
Q4, +1.4% in Q3, +1.5% in Q2, +2.5% in Q1 m quarter of 2020. A relative
decrease in the indicator may negatively affect the NZD quotes.
Forecast: +1.0%.

###  **Wednesday, April 21**

###  **01:30 AUD Retail Sales Index**

This indicator is published monthly by the Australian Bureau of
Statistics and estimates total retail sales. The index is often
considered an indicator of consumer confidence and reflects the health
of the retail sector in the near term. A rise in the index is usually
positive for the AUD; a decrease in the indicator will negatively affect
the AUD. The previous value of the index (for February) was -0.8%. If
the data turns out to be weaker than the previous value, the AUD may
sharply decline in the short term; however if it is above the previous
values, the AUD is likely to strengthen. Forecast: +0.8% in March.

###  **06:00 GBP Consumer Price Index. Core Consumer Price Index**

Consumer Price Index (CPI) reflects the dynamics of retail prices for a
group of goods and services that make up the British consumer basket.
CPI is a key indicator of inflation. Its publication causes active
movement of the pound in the foreign exchange market, as well as the
London Stock Exchange FTSE100 index.

In the previous reporting month (February), the growth in consumer
inflation (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) amounted to +0.4%.

Forecast for March: +0.7% (annualized). This value indicates weak
inflationary pressures and is unlikely to provide significant support to
the pound. Indicator value below the forecast could provoke a weakening
of the pound, as low inflation will force the Bank of England to adhere
to a soft monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).

Core CPI is published by the Office for National Statistics and
determines the price change of a selected basket of goods and services
(excluding food and energy) for a given period. It is a key indicator
for assessing inflation and changes in purchasing preferences. A
positive result strengthens the GBP, a negative one weakens it.

In September, Core CPI (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) increased by +1.3%, in October
- by +1.5%, in December and January - by +1.4%. Probably, the
publication of the indicator will have a positive short-term effect on
the pound if its value is higher than the forecast and previous values.
Forecast for March: +1.0% (annualized). The indicator value below the
forecast and previous values ​​may provoke a weakening of the pound.

###  **10:30 GBP Speech by Head of the Bank of England Andrew Bailey**

Financial market participants expect Andrew Bailey to clarify the
situation regarding the further [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the UK central bank.
Volatility during the speech of the head of the Bank of England usually
rises sharply in the quotes of the pound and the London Stock Exchange
FTSE index, if he gives any hints of tightening or easing of the Bank of
England's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). Andrew Bailey will probably also touch on the
state and prospects of the British economy after Brexit and tough
quarantine restrictions due to the coronavirus. If Bailey does not touch
upon the issues of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), then the reaction to his speech will
be weak.

###  **12:30 CAD Consumer price indices in Canada**

Core CPI from the Bank of Canada reflects the dynamics of the retail
prices of the corresponding basket of goods and services (excluding
fruits, vegetables, gasoline, fuel oil, natural gas, mortgage interest,
intercity transportation, and tobacco products). The inflation target
for the Bank of Canada is in the range of 1-3%. The rise in CPI is a
harbinger of a rate hike and a positive factor for the CAD. Core
Consumer Price Index increased by +1.6% in January 2021, +0.7% in
December 2020, +1.5% in November, +1.0% in October and September (in
annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)). If the data for March turns out to be worse than the
previous values, it will negatively affect the CAD. The data better than
the previous values will strengthen the Canadian dollar. Forecast: Core
CPI rose by +1.4% (yoy) in March, which is likely to have a positive
impact on the CAD.

###  **14:00 CAD Bank of Canada's decision on interest rate.
Accompanying statement. Bank of Canada's Monetary Policy Committee
Report**

The Bank of Canada will decide on the interest rate. In March 2020, the
bank lowered the rate 3 times to the level of 0.25% to mitigate the
economic damage from the novel coronavirus pandemic.

In the accompanying statement, the central bank of Canada said that the
decision "aims to support the financial system, which plays a central
role in lending to the economy, as well as to create a foundation that
will allow the economy to return to normal." The central bank also said
in a press release that the spread of the coronavirus and the plummeting
global oil prices combined are weighing heavily on Canadians and the
Canadian economy.

In fact, quantitative easing and a significant cut in the interest rate
should contribute to the weakening of the national currency.

The impact of the coronavirus on the Canadian economy and the country's
labor market (in March 2020, unemployment rose to 7.8% from 5.6% in
February, and the number of employed, as reported by Statistics Canada,
fell by 1.01 million), and weakness in the housing market is also
putting pressure on the Bank of Canada to further ease monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).

However, the Bank of Canada is expected to keep its interest rate at
0.25% at its meeting on Wednesday.

Tough tone of the accompanying statement by the Bank of Canada on rising
inflation and the prospects for further tightening of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
will cause the Canadian dollar to strengthen. If the Bank of Canada
signals the need for soft monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), the Canadian currency will
decline.

###  **15:15 CAD Press conference of the Bank of Canada**

During the press conference, the head of the Bank of Canada Tiff Macklem
will explain the bank's position and assess the current economic
situation in the country. If the tone of his speech is tough on the
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the Bank of Canada, the Canadian dollar will
strengthen in the foreign exchange market. If Macklem speaks out for
maintaining a soft monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), the Canadian currency will decline.
In any case, high volatility in the CAD quotes is expected during the
period of his speech.

###  **Thursday, April 22**

###  **11:45 EUR ECB's decision on interest rates**

The ECB will publish its decision on the key rate and on the deposit
rate. The ECB's tough stance on inflation and key interest rates
contributes to the strengthening of the euro, while the soft stance and
rate cuts weaken the euro. In September 2019, the European Central Bank
lowered its key interest rate on deposits by 0.1%, to -0.5%, for the
first time since March 2016 and began buying bonds worth 20 billion
euros a month, renewing the so-called quantitative easing program.
According to the ECB management, the balance of risks for the economic
prospects of the Eurozone "is still shifted to the negative side", and
"until inflation is in line" with the target level, which is just below
2%, the rate will remain low. Now inflation in the Eurozone is
stubbornly holding around 1%, and the new forecasts of the ECB on rates
and the QE program can be seen as a signal of the inclination to further
soften [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).

Besides Brexit, the trade conflicts, factors of political instability in
Europe, as well as the spreading coronavirus pandemic, due to which
European countries are forced to introduce new quarantine restrictions
that negatively affect economic activity, are the main threats to the
European economy. Back in March 2020, the ECB signaled the possibility
of [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) easing, and the bank's representative admitted that the bank's
management could lower the already negative interest rates even lower.

Probably, following the results of this ECB meeting, the key interest
rate will remain at the same level of 0%. The ECB's rate on deposits for
commercial banks is also likely to remain at -0.5%. At the same time,
there is a possibility that at this meeting the ECB will announce a new
program to stimulate the economy, which will put pressure on the euro.

###  **12:30 EUR Press conference of the ECB**

During the press conference, a surge in volatility is possible not only
in the euro quotes, but also in the entire financial market if the ECB
leaders make an unexpected statement. Similar previous decisions by the
ECB on interest rates and subsequent press conferences have moved the
euro rate by 3-5% in a short time. The ECB leaders will assess the
current economic situation in the Eurozone and comment on the ECB's rate
decision.

The soft tone of the statements will have a negative impact on the euro.
Conversely, a tough tone from ECB officials on central bank monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) will strengthen the euro.

###  **07:30 EUR Germany Manufacturing PMI by Markit Economics
(preliminary release). Composite PMI by Markit Economics (preliminary
release)**

Germany's Manufacturing PMI is an important indicator of the business
environment and the overall health of the German economy. This sector of
the economy forms a significant part of Germany's GDP. A result above 50

for the euro. Forecast for April (preliminary release): 65.9.

Previous monthly values: 66.6, 60.7, 57.1, 58.3, 57.8, indicating that
business activity in this sector of the German economy is accelerating

of the indicator above the previous values ​​will support the euro (in
the short term). The data worse than the forecast will have a negative
impact on the euro.

Composite PMI is an important indicator of the business environment and
the overall health of the German economy. A result above 50 is seen as
positive and strengthens the EUR, one below 50 as negative for the euro.
Forecast for April (preliminary release): 57.0 against 57.3, 51.1, 50.8,
52.0, 51.7 in previous months. The publication of this indicator with
the specified expected value is likely to support the euro in the short
term, despite the relative decline. The data worse than the forecast and
below the value of 50.0 will have a negative impact on the euro.

###  **08:00 EUR Eurozone Composite Manufacturing PMI by Markit
Economics (preliminary release)**

Eurozone's Manufacturing PMI is an important indicator of the health of
the entire European economy. A result above 50 is seen as positive and

release)**

UK's Services PMI is an important indicator of the health of the UK
economy. The services sector employs most of the UK's working-age
population and accounts for approximately 75% of GDP. Financial services
continue to be the most important part of the service industry. If the
data turns out to be worse than the forecast and the previous value, the
pound is likely to drop sharply in the short term. The data better than
the forecast and the previous value will have a positive impact on the
pound. At the same time, a result above 50 is seen as positive and
strengthens the GBP, one below 50 - as negative for the GBP.

Previous values ​​of the indicator: 56.3 in March, 49.5 in February,
39.5 in January 2021 after falling to levels of 29.0 in May, 13.4 in
April, 34.5 in March 2020. Preliminary forecast for April: 59.0.
