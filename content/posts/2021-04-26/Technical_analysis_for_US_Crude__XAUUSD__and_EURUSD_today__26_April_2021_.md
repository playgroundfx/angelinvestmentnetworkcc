Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 26.04.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

Today, the euro reached the Gold Zone 1.2112 - 1.2104 at the Asian
trading session. Further growth will be possible after the price breaks
out the GZ and consolidates higher.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

On Monday morning, a short-term oil downtrend continues. Sales targets
are:

  1. Support level 60.75

  2. Target Zone 59.25 - 58.74.

According to the last week's ideas, it is profitable to hold oil sales
entered in the zone of 62.22 - 61.87.

An alternative scenario: if the price breaks out level 62.22 and
consolidates higher at the US session, expect the price to reach the
Intermediary Zone 63.40 - 63.14.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

Hold down sales entered in the zone of 62.22 - 61.87. TakeProfit: 60.75,
Target Zone 59.25 - 58.74. StopLoss: 63.05.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

The gold is correcting to a short-term uptrend. As part of the
correction, the Intermediary Zone 1772 - 1770 was tested. The
Intermediary Zone is the trend key support. Together with level 1768,
there is the zone of 1772 - 1768, where there are good prices to buy
gold.

Now, the price reaction to the test of the strong resistance level of
the Additional Zone 1783 - 1782 can be seen. The target of the fall is
to update Friday low.

A pattern is needed for entering purchases according to the trend. A
“false breakout” or “1-2-3” can serve as a pattern. Watch the
development of trading.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

Open buy positions according to the pattern in 1772 - 1768. TakeProfit:
1796. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

Today, the euro reached the Gold Zone 1.2112 - 1.2104 at the Asian
trading session. Further growth will be possible after the price breaks
out the GZ and consolidates higher.

In the meantime, expect a correction at strong supports to enter new
purchases at favorable prices. The target for purchases will be today's
high.

Strong supports from which it is profitable to look for long trades are:

  1. Additional Zone 1.2072 - 1.2068.

  2. Intermediary Zone 1.2028 - 1.2020.

A pattern is required for purchases.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

  1. Buy according to the pattern in Additional Zone 1.2072 - 1.2068. TakeProfit: 1.2112. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. Buy according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 1.2028 - 1.2020. TakeProfit: 1.2112. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.
