Monero Price Prediction for the Years: 2021, 2023, 2025, 2030, and
BeyondJana Kane

[The Monero (][1][XMR coin][1][) price][1] has recently shown
significant fluctuations like any other cryptocurrency. The crypto’s
future looks bright, making it a relatively reliable addition to
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s' crypto portfolios with a good Monero price target.

The article covers the following subjects:

Due to these price movements, Monero is the 24th coin of all
cryptocurrencies in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of value on Coinmarketcap at the time of
writing. In this article, we'll take a look at [Monero's future
price][1] predictions, covering the basics of the project and ending
with Monero's future price predictions from experts. Want to bet on the
high price expectations of Monero? Why is Monero going up, and is Monero
a good investment? Read on to find out our Monero price prediction!

## What Is Monero?

The digital currency Monero (XMR) has been around since 2014 and has
seen a lot in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of price in recent years. But what is it that makes
Monero so special and distinguishes itself from the other larger and
more famous cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ripple?

How is it that the price of the Monero shows these beautiful upward
lines recently, despite the decline in 2018? Monero is also referred to
as the sleeping crypto giant - and understandably so. In the information
below, we explain why this crypto coin is interesting and why it is
important to keep a close eye on the Monero price.

Monero is the leading cryptocurrency with an emphasis on privacy and
censorship-resistant transactions. Most existing cryptocurrencies,
including Bitcoin and Ethereum, have transparent [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/)s, meaning
that transactions are openly verifiable and traceable to anyone in the
world. In addition, sending and receiving addresses for these
transactions can potentially be linked to a person's real identity.

We have listed a number of important features that make the Monero
future so interesting and distinguish it from the other
cryptocurrencies:

  * Transactions with Monero are confidential and not traceable.
  * The Monero project is 100% decentralized.
  * Monero has a team of more than 240 experienced developers behind it.
  * Monero is scalable because it has no fixed size for a block.
  * Monero transactions are confidential and non-traceable.
  * By default, every Monero transaction hides the send and receive addresses and the amounts processed.

This always-on privacy measure means that any Monero user activity
enhances other users’ privacy, as opposed to selectively transparent
cryptocurrencies (e.g., Z-Cash). Monero is fungible.

This means that Monero is always accepted without the risk of
censorship. The Kovri project will track and encrypt transactions
through I2P Invisible Internet Project nodes. This obscures the IP
address of a transaction and provides further protection against network
surveillance.

Monero is a grassroots community that attracts the world's best
cryptocurrency researchers and tech talent. More than 240 developers
contributed to the Monero project, including 30 core developers. Forums
and chat channels are welcoming and active.

Monero's Research Lab, Core Development Team, and community developers
are constantly pushing the boundaries of what's possible with
cryptocurrency privacy and security.

Monero is not a company. It was developed by cryptography and
distributed systems experts from around the world who donate their time
or are funded through community donations. This means that Monero cannot
be closed by any country and is not limited by any particular legal
jurisdiction.

## Monero in the Past and the History of XMR

Monero has been around for a while. 2021 will be a good year for Monero.
In 2020, the price increased considerably compared to the year before,
but this year seems to be an even better year due to all the new
developments. Read on about the latest Monero [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) and expectations. A
lot has happened in the meantime. It is quite clear that Monero has a
bright future, but first, we'll take a look at what happened with Monero
before that.

### May 2014 - The Start of Monero

On May 21, 2014, Monero was launched on the crypto exchanges. The value
was set at $2.47 under the first name of BitMonero. This is a
combination of the word '' money '' in Esperanto and Bit from Bitcoin.
The coin flopped completely. Fans from the crypto community decided to
take over the project and launched Monero with the current name.

### Early 2015 - Historical Low

The initial appreciation turned out to be way too high. The price
dropped to $0.2130 on January 14, 2015 (Coinmarketcap), which was a
historic low for the currency.

### Late 2016 - Sudden Revival

At the end of 2016, things suddenly went underway. The currency shot to
13.60 dollars. This was the highest valuation of the coin at the time.

### 2017 - Growth Continues

2017 was a fantastic year for Monero. The growth continued and suddenly
reached a rate of around 130 dollars halfway through the year.

### 2017/2018 - Monero Goes Through the Ceiling

All virtual coins exploded, and so did Monero. The coin reached its
[historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) peak of no less than $495.84 (Coinmarketcap, January 7,
2018).

### End of 2018 - Back to Square One

Monero, like many other cryptos, dropped all the way back to the value
of 1.5 years before. With such a rate, many [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s lost some of their
confidence in the coin.

### 2020 - Monero Race: Back on Track

The rate of Monero is back on the rise. After closing 2019 with a
meaningless change, the coin now seems unstoppable. Because it is now
one of the older coins, with a good reputation in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of privacy, the
popularity of the coin is increasing enormously. This can be seen in the
price.

## Monero to US dollar current price rate

### Factors that affect Monero’s rate

The XMR price is mainly dependent on market demand. The rising demand
and popularity of the coin can serve as drivers of the XMR's growth.
Inversely, administrative barriers, additional [regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/), and a decline
in popularity can lead to a potential drop in the cryptocurrency rate.

## Monero Price Predictions by Experts

Let us reflect on the Monero (XMR) price prediction from major distinct
sources, which will give us a fairer idea:

### TradingBeasts

Trading beasts predicted that Monero could reach around $150 ( they
almost got it right!) by the end of 2020, which means that it could
roughly reach about $400 by the end of 2021.

### Crypto Ground

Crypto ground is a cryptocurrency prediction [website](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/website-for-forex-trading/) that also stated
that Monero might be worth $150 at the beginning of 2021. In 5 years,
the XMR coin has a good possibility that it might reach $496.82 and
might even go over the $500 mark if the market is calm enough.

### Oracle Times

Monero is going to be one of the top 3 performing cryptocurrencies in
2021, according to Oracle Times, and the performance might be thoroughly
maintained. Because of the privacy [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), Monero is gaining worldwide
acceptance.

### Wallet Investor

There is a downturn Monero trend predicted and XMR token may lose sheen
by almost half of its current price - stooping to as low as $100.14 by
the first quarter of 2021.

## Monero Technical Analysis

We're starting our technical analysis of [XMR/USD][2] quotes with the
one-month time frame. First, we'll identify a global trend and key
levels.

There's an accelerating bullish trend, observed since March 2019. The
pair has been growing intensely on low volumes in the past three months,
so I would carefully suggest an upcoming downside reversal. Our further
Monero forecast will show if the projected fall will be a correction or
a fully developed downward reversal.

The blue dots on the Monero-USD price chart mark the candlesticks whose
extremum values form support (red lines) and resistance (green lines)
levels.

The all-time peak in Monero's price [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) formed a resistance level at
474.64 in December 2017. It indicates that the current trend hasn't
exhausted its growth potential yet.

The next level formed at the red candlestick's minimum of 38.73 USD in
December 2018. The price tested it twice in the following months but
couldn't consolidate below. It will hardly manage to break that level in
the near time. Another support level of 120.97 USD formed at the volume
maximum in June 2019.

### Monero price prediction for next three months

To have an idea of Monero future value, let's do a technical analysis of
the weekly time frame.

To make a realistic Monero price forecast, I marked with blue dotted
lines a short-term trend channel that formed with the bullish movement
intensification. Another two key levels will be of use here too: 379.01
US dollars, formed in March 2018, and 297.75 USD, formed in April 2018.

The likeliest outlook is that intense growth will change into a
corrective phase. Several signals point at that simultaneously:

  * The market has been growing on low volumes in the past weeks.

  * The [MACD indicator](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/macd.html) went to the overbought area and will reach the resistance level soon (the green line). It has been pulling back repeatedly from that level since summer 2019.

  *  The price is approaching the channel's upper limit fast.

A reversal will most probably occur at the psychologically important
level of 400 USD. The initial target will be the support level at
297.75.

A scenario where the price chart will be tending to the main trend line
in the area of 160–200 USD is the most realistic one. It will be
activated once the price consolidates below the short-term line and the
297.75 level.

In an alternative scenario where the bullish movement continues,
Monero's prediction chart will consolidate above 400. The level of
474.64 US dollars will be a price target in that scenario.

### What will be the price of Monero in 2021?

To make [Monero][2]'s price prediction for this year, I've added the
projection of the price's projected movement plotted according to
Bollinger bands' width. The projected value will go from 150 to 400 US
dollars this year. At the same time, don't expect that the main trend
line and the level of 379.01 will be reached in the long term.

Technical analysis indicates that the price may be expected to correct
to the main trend line before autumn. So, up to then, the price target
will range from 170 to 180 USD. Then, the price may pull back and start
moving to 474.64 in a bullish trend.

The expected Monero trading range for each month is presented in the
table below.

## Long-Term Monero Price Forecast 2025-2030

Many different predictions have been made for the Monero price. How high
can Monero go? How much will it go up in value? In particular, the
growing problems surrounding the privacy of internet users are a big
plus for the project. Many people are starting to value their personal
data more and more, and all financial data is, of course, also part of
this. So, if you’re asking the question: “should I invest in Monero?”
Keep reading.

With Monero, it is therefore very interesting to save your money since
it is not accessible to everyone, even on the [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/).

According to Coinswitch, this could also be the reason for a large price
increase for the Monero future value. If we are to believe the
predictions, which we should always take with a grain of salt, it would,
in any case, be a good addition to your cryptocurrency portfolio for
diversification.

The Monero projected growth for 2021 could be between $400 and $600
($164.31), according to Coinswitch. If only a small percentage of people
are actually going to "protect" their money using Monero, this should be
easy to achieve.

The Monero projected value for 2025-2030 is even higher, at around $900.
With many cryptocurrencies that are only partially anonymous, Monero
knows [how to](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-trading-how-to/) distinguish itself using its XMR. Please note that such a
long-term price prediction and Monero price forecast is very approximate
and is merely speculation.

## How Has the Price of XMR Changed Over Time?

Is Monero expected to rise? On Coinmarketcap, the Monero price today is
$385.06. This value is interactive; you’ll be able to refer to this
article to see the current price tomorrow.

Its all-time high was [$495.84 on January 7, 2018][5] (Coinmarketcap). At the time of writing (February 9, 2021), Monero’s market cap was[][5][$2,845,886,790][5]. But in order to make the most reliable and realistic cryptocurrency predictions, it's important not just to look ahead at the projection but also to look back at the [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) price performance of Monero. Below you can see the chart of how the price [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) of Monero changed over the years of its existence.

## What Is the Future of Monero? Is XMR a Good Investment?

Many [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are concerned that they have entered too late. "With such
a high rate, I will never make more profits." However, this is not
always the case. Let's see if now is a good time to get into Monero.
Monero has gained a big name in the crypto world in recent years. They
are number 1 when it comes to the privacy and security of users. This
added to the Monero growth and Monero supply.

This is a very interesting fact because privacy is becoming an
increasingly important topic. More and more traders are starting to see
the benefits of this coin, and the outlook is therefore also bright.
Especially if you consider the [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/)ly highest price ever - it has
not yet been reached again, and that proves that there is still a lot of
growth in this crypto. [Monero ][1]has a good price target, as it also
moves strongly with Bitcoin.

About Bitcoin, experts say it will rise for a while. Some say
it[][6][will rise to $100,000 in the coming years][6]. This means that
Monero will rise also. Either way, here's a Monero prediction chart for
2021:

Month| Open| Low-High| Close| Mo,%| Total,%  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
2021  
 **Feb**|  137| 137-238|  **204**|  48.9%| 48.9%  
 **Mar**|  204| 166-254|  **237**|  16.2%| 73.0%  
 **Apr**|  237| 193-237|  **207**|  -12.7%| 51.1%  
 **May**|  207| 207-257|  **240**|  15.9%| 75.2%  
 **Jun**|  240| 228-262|  **245**|  2.1%| 78.8%  
 **Jul**|  245| 245-304|  **284**|  15.9%| 107%  
 **Aug**|  284| 281-323|  **302**|  6.3%| 120%  
 **Sep**|  302| 302-369|  **345**|  14.2%| 152%  
 **Oct**|  345| 345-428|  **400**|  15.9%| 192%  
 **Nov**|  400| 365-421|  **393**|  -1.8%| 187%  
 **Dec**|  393| 381-439|  **410**|  4.3%| 199%  
  
Monero has proven itself over the years as a major player in the crypto
market. It is still a very interesting cryptocurrency, despite the
extreme gains in 2020. Monero- buy or sell: this is the real question.
The price still has many growth opportunities.

Because the coin considers the privacy of its users of paramount
importance, it has an advantage over other coins. This is what makes
this coin special. Especially with the high supply of alternative
currencies, this distinctive character is very important.

If you want to start trading Monero, do it with a reputable
exchange/broker. The broker must at least have an internal wallet in
which you must be able to store your coins. A good example of this is
LiteForex. A great reason to create a free demo account on LiteForex!
LiteForex has fact-checked information and a user-friendly platform for
novices, as well as experienced traders.
