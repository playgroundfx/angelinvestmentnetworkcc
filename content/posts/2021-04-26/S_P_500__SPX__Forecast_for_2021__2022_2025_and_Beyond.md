S&P 500 (SPX) Forecast and price predictionJana Kane

The consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic are negatively impacting many
companies worldwide. Many of these companies have already cut,
postponed, or canceled their dividends. They do this to save capital.

Within the S&P 500, 12 companies reduced dividend payments on March 30,
2020, or decided not to distribute at all. While some companies have
lowered their dividends, another group of companies within the S&P 500
is expected to increase payouts.

Today’s savings interest rate is no longer yielding anything, and many
banks have almost reached 0% savings interest. In combination with
annual price increases, your savings will be worthless. Index investing
can offer a solution for saving. In this article, we discuss a specific
index, namely the S&P 500 index (SPX).

We’ll tell you everything you need to know about the U.S. stock market
index [S&P 500][1]. Will the price of the S&P 500 go up? How much will
the stock index cost? Let’s find out in this S&P 500 forecast!

The article covers the following subjects:

## About the S&P 500 Stock Index

In 1923, the Standard and Poor’s 500 stock index credit rating agency
began compiling the S&P 500 index. This index includes 233 companies
from the United States. It initially had a weekly count but was changed
to a [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) one in 1926.

In 1957 the S&P 500 index was expanded by Standard and Poor’s to 500
companies. From that moment on, the index was better known as the S&P
500 index, or simply SPX.

In the early stages of the [S&P 500][1] index, a specific number of
companies per sector were included in the index. This was discontinued
in 1988, and since then, the [S&P 500][1] consisted of the 500 largest
publicly-traded companies in the United States.

The S&P 500 index is compiled based on the market value of US stocks.
This makes it easy to adjust the list every year.

The S&P 500 index now consists of the largest companies from more than
90 sectors. Therefore, the index is a good reflection of the state of
the economy of the United States.

The weighting of the companies within the index is related to the stock
market value of a company. In the case of the S&P 500 stock (stocks),
Apple is the most valuable company, accounting for 3.25% of the index’s
total value.

Other companies that have considerable weight are the S&P 500 stock of
Alphabet A + B (Google), Microsoft, [Amazon][2], AT&T, and
[Facebook][3], among others. The top 10 of the S&P 500 indices account
for just over 20% of the entire index.

Because the S&P 500 index is a good reflection of the United States
economy, it makes it a very popular index among economists and
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s.

The SPF price for today is 4 189.5 US Dollars.

## Top Factors That May Impact S&P 500 Now and, In the Future

When investing in the [S&P 500][4], it is important to remember that the
weight of stocks has a significant influence on the price. The largest
shares sometimes count ten times more than the smallest shares.

Therefore, a change of course for the largest ten companies has a
relatively large impact on the course of the S&P 500 index.

Since 1987, circuit breakers have been entered on the S&P 500 index.
This decision was made on Black Monday because the stock market fell by
[as much as 20.47%][5] in a short time. When the prices fall by 7%, 13%,
and 20%, trading is stopped for a quarter of an hour.

The break allows [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s to properly analyze the situation. In this
way, the first panic reaction can be countered so that the stock market
collapses less quickly in the event of bad [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/).

The index can be affected by acquisitions, divestitures, the covid
pandemic, trade wars, political issues, restructuring, and dividend
payments – not just a company’s performance.

## Pros and Cons of Investing in S&P 500

Did you decide to opt for [S&P 500][4] as a novice [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)? Then you
must, of course, know what the advantages and disadvantages of this
investment product are.

 **The advantages are:**

  * Thanks to the leverage effect, investments can be made in small amounts.
  * Profits can be achieved in both a falling and a rising stock market.
  * The profit opportunities are greater than with direct investments.
  * Novice [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s can easily start trading indices, bonds, or commodities.
  * Trading continues almost continuously, five days a week. Investors, therefore, almost always have the option of protecting a position taken by setting a stop loss.
  * Investors can hedge their investment portfolio with futures. For example, did you buy shares? By also investing in futures, you can partially cover the financial risk of those shares. How? By taking short positions. By taking short positions against the shares you have bought, the market risk is partially hedged.
  * The leverage (at LiteForex) makes it possible to make an optimal profit if there are changes in the underlying asset price.

 **The drawbacks are:**

  * Using leverage does not only lead to profit. Of course, a loss can also be incurred when using leverage. This loss can add up quickly. This form of investing is riskier than investing directly in, for example, shares.
  * Remember that with futures, you can lose more than your investment.
  * Trading CFDs successfully? You must then keep a close eye on your positions, given the long opening hours and the leverage. So, you need a lot of time to be able to follow [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) (chart) developments.
  * The stock market is initially very volatile.
  * The value is highly dependent on the market value of companies from the index.
  * The list of companies is changing.

## S&P 500 Price Future Predictions for 2021 by Experts

Most Wall Street analysts are optimistic about 2021, expecting the
leading S&P 500 index to close 2021 with a profit. This is according to
an S&P 500 forecast survey [conducted by CNBC][6] among 20 analysts from
the largest financial institutions on Wall Street.

The stock market experts predict a gain of between 8% and 22% for the
S&P 500 for next year.

Twelve of the twenty respondents expect the S&P to rise to 4,000 to
4,500 points in 2021. Fourteen of the twenty analysts are ‘cautiously
optimistic’ about 2021, three are ‘very optimistic,’ and three others
are mainly ‘cautious’ because of [S&P 500][1] [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) trends.
Currently, the index is already at .

### New Record-Highs in 2021

The optimistic analysts have high hopes for the rollout of the
coronavirus vaccines, which started in the United Kingdom. This group
also assumes that Washington D.C. will develop a second corona support
package for the U.S. economy. These developments are expected to lead to
a recovery in corporate earnings and economic growth, which is good for
the US 500 forecast.

“We believe that low interest rates, coupled with a recovery in earnings
in the S&P 500, will cause equities to hit new highs in 2021,” said an
analyst. Another stock market expert made an S&P 500 forecast showing a
15% rally in the stock markets if the world returns to the old normal.

## S&P500 Technical Analysis

We're starting our technical analysis with bigger time frames. It's on a
monthly chart that we are going to do a trend analysis of the [S&P
500][1] first.

The price chart above shows that the SPX has followed a bullish trend
since 2016. A powerful drawdown broke the trend line at the beginning of
2020, but the index recovered fast and fully covered the bearish
correction as early as in summer 2020. That confirmed the breakout was
false.

In the end, the bullish trend continues, but the trend channel got
larger because of the downward momentum.

The upper projection of that channel limited the index's growth
potential to the area of 4,000 points. However, that limit was exceeded
last month. The SPX is located in a local channel, and going outside
would be a signal of correction.

I don't see any prerequisites for such a signal on the monthly time
frame, so let's switch to a smaller time frame to have a clearer idea.

### SPX index prediction for next three months

Conducting a technical analysis of the [SPX index][7] on the weekly
price chart, we see several indirect indications of a local bullish
trend's exhaustion. The clearest one is a bearish divergence on the MACD
histogram. We see that it isn't following the price growth. At the same
time, the divergence is cascading, which increases the probability of
the bullish trend's reversal.

Another important sign of a future price fall is a decrease in trading
volumes after the breakout of the trend channel's upper projection.
Neither [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s nor traders are eager to buy at the current levels.

Looking at Fibo levels, we see that the price approached the important
level of 1.618 from the past correction's depth. Such levels usually
pose a problem to bulls. They will hardly break that level in a weak
bullish market.

Thus, having analysed the S&P 500 's price [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) in the medium term,
we can conclude that a correction scenario will prevail in the nearest
three months.

The potential of a downside movement is located in the strong support
area at the crossing with the trend line at 3,200 - 3,400 USD.

### What will be the price of S&P 500 in 2021?

The S&P 500 chart above presents double Bollinger bands with deviations
1 and 2. As we see, the Standard and Poor's 500 Index's chart is feeling
confident.

We can't be sure about a correction until the price confirms the buyer's
weakness. If a bullish scenario unfolds, the market growth potential is
in the area of a powerful psychological level of 5,000 US dollars.

No trader can imagine that value can be reached without a fully
developed correction, so corrective sentiment and bearish expectations
will grow with each new peak.

Thus, a V-shape correction is the likeliest scenario up to the end of
2021. The [SPX][1] is still expected to grow, but current volumes make
it hard to imagine growth above 4,400 - 4,500 points. The main support
line is at around 3,400 USD.

Based on the corrective scenario, the SPX index price will move to the
buyers' area in August or September. If the outlook is too bearish, the
support levels may be tested for the first time as early as July.

If the situation is extremely negative, the index value may break out
the level of 3,000 or even test the level of 2,800. Again, it's hard to
imagine a deeper fall. For a downside movement that deep, there must be
serious fundamental reasons.

A pullback from the support levels is expected to be fast. According to
the forecast, the [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) maximums may be retested before the end of
the year.

Based on weekly Bollinger bands and the forecast above, I projected the
likeliest price areas for each month.

The chart above presents monthly candlesticks' projections. To determine
specific levels, I marked their limits in the table below.

## Long Term S&P 500 Forecast 2025-2030

It’s not realistic to make such a long-term S&P 500 forecast. However,
we can say that when extending the best-fit line and the prediction
bands, then the S&P-real end of December 2030 value would be 4,549,
while the highest and lowest values shown by the prediction bands would
be about 8,780 and 2,360, respectively.

 _Source: marketsignals.com_

Thus, the historic trend and price [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) produce a long-term price
prediction of a 2.1% annualized return for S&P-real from its current
level of 3,906 to the end of 2030. The worst-case scenario would be a
possible annualized return of -4.4%, and the best outcome could be an
annualized return of 9.0%.

## How Has the Price Of the S&P 500 Changed Over Time?

Since the creation of the S&P 500 index, the S&P 500 price has risen
enormously. Mainly from 2011, the price of the index has risen
enormously. The question is - [how to](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-trading-how-to/) analyze S&P 500 forecast?

The price of the index fell significantly in 2003 and 2008. This is
because the S&P 500 index is a good reflection of the United States’
economy during those periods of an economic crisis.

 _Source: macrotrends.net_

The 5-year chart shows the S&P 500 projections of the S&P 500 index. At
the beginning of 2020, the S&P 500 price was around 3400 points. In
March, the rate plummeted to about 2191 points.

The S&P 500 index has rebounded nicely from this loss in the rest of the
year, closing 2020 with over 3,750 points. The current price of the S&P
500 is USD.

## What Is the Future Price of the S&P 500? Is S&P 500 a Good
Investment?

The S&P 500 index is a globally popular index, if not the most popular.
The S&P 500 index consists of the 500 largest companies in the United
States from more than 90 different industries.

This makes the S&P 500 index popular not only among [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s but also
among economists. The S&P 500 is a good reflection of the economy of the
United States.

The biggest advantage of investing in an index over an individual stock
is diversification. With the S&P 500, you spread your risk over 500
stocks instead of just one, making your investment less sensitive to
volatile price movements.

Below is an S&P 500 forecast chart for 2021:

Year| Mo| Min| Max| Close| Mo,%| Total%  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2021| Feb| 3699| 4171| 3935| 4.3%| 4.3%  
2021| Mar| 3857| 4349| 4103| 4.3%| 8.7%  
2021| Apr| 3875| 4369| 4122| 0.5%| 9.2%  
2021| May| 3973| 4481| 4227| 2.5%| 12.0%  
2021| Jun| 4172| 4704| 4438| 5.0%| 17.6%  
2021| Jul| 4035| 4551| 4293| -3.3%| 13.8%

2021| Sep| 4062| 4580| 4321| 5.0%| 14.5%  
2021| Oct| 4264| 4808| 4536| 5.0%| 20.2%  
2021| Nov| 4348| 4903| 4625| 2.0%| 22.6%  
2021| Dec| 4565| 5147| 4856| 5.0%| 28.7%

But while investing in the S&P 500 index is generally a safer
investment, it also has its flaws, such as that all index funds often
fall sharply when a bear market develops. While you are invested in
multiple stocks, returns are also mirrored when the United States makes
certain decisions about whether the U.S. dollar is going down.

Before purchasing an investment asset, consider all risk and reward
factors, including any investment product associated with the S&P 500.

If you think investing in S&P 500 is something for you, do it with a
reputable exchange/broker. A good example of this is LiteForex. A great
reason to create a free demo account on LiteForex!
