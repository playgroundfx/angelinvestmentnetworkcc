When will the dollar turn off the money flow? Forecast as of
26.04.2021Dmitri Demidenko

Successful vaccination and explosive GDP growth give the Fed reasons to
consider the tapering of the QE. Nonetheless, the experience of the
taper tantrum in 2013 suggests it will not be easy. Will Jerome Powell
solve the task? Let us discuss the Forex outlook and make up a
[EURUSD][1] trading plan.

## Weekly US dollar fundamental forecast

In March, the US dollar grew amid the US exclusivity, and [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s
admired the vaccination speed and the US economic rebound. In April,
everything has dramatically changed. The exclusivity fades as many
countries are speeding up vaccination campaigns, and their economies are
set to grow rapidly during the rest of the year. In addition to the WHO
announcement that the number of coronavirus cases is increasing in all
regions of the world except Europe, this circumstance allowed the
[EURUSD][1] bulls to drive the price above the base of figure 21.

About 68% of the adult population received at least one dose of the
coronavirus vaccine in the USA. Furthermore, the US services PMI hit an
all-time high of 63.1 in April. However, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s will hardly be
surprised with these data. Another matter is strong economic data in the
euro area. The euro-area manufacturing PMI has hit its all-time high,
and the services PMI has exceeded level 50 for the first time in eight
months, indicating the economic expansion.

### Dynamics of euro-area PMIs

According to Bloomberg experts, the euro-area GDP contracted by 0.8%
Q-o-Q in the first quarter, which means the currency bloc should face a
double-dip recession. Nonetheless, the downturn resulted from lockdowns
is temporary, which is proven by the euro-area PMI data.

The euro-area positive PMI data, the increase in the vaccination speed,
the seasonal pandemic decline in Europe are likely to affect the
Governing Council’s decisions in the near future. According to
Bloomberg’s source familiar with the matter, the ECB April meeting was
relatively calm, but there should be a heated debate at the next meeting
on June 10. Some ECB officials call for the PEPP reduction already in
the third quarter.

The Fed, whose meeting along with the publication of the US and European
GDP data will become the highlights of the current week, has a different
task. The major experience the Fed has drawn from the 2013 taper tantrum
is that there are limits to the central bank's ability to calm financial
markets amid a move towards tighter monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). The main question
that will be discussed at the next FOMC meetings is [how to](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-trading-how-to/) inform
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s about turning off the money flow correctly. In my opinion,
despite the success of the US economy, it will be pretty easy for Jerome
Powell to reassure [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s now, as the US fight against the pandemic
has not finished yet.

If the Fed Chair does not scare financial markets, and his speech at the
press conference does not result in the Treasury yields rally,
speculators will be able to sell the US dollar further.

### Weekly [EURUSD][1] trading plan

I believe the factors of the euro-area double-dip recession and the US
GDP surge in the first quarter have already been priced in the
[EURUSD][1]. Therefore, if the actual data will be close to the
forecasts, one could buy the pair on the correction with the buy targets
at 1.2155 and 1.218 [suggested earlier][2].
