EURUSD: deep technical analysis and medium-term forecastMikhail Hypov

##  **EURUSD: channel and trend analysis, volume analysis, candlesticks
analysis, TD candlestick projections, Pivot points, support and
resistance levels, main targets.**

I often make long-term forecasts for currency pairs but it’s been a long
time since I analysed the euro. I’m going to correct it in this
analysis. Fundamental analysis has already been done by my colleague
Dmitriy Demidenko and you can check it [here][1] if you’re interested in
more details. I’ll only provide the main conclusion: the
disproportionately large volume of funds pumped into the US economy will
put pressure on the USD. So, there’s a chance of consolidating above
1.08. I will take this estimation as given and save time for delving
into technical analysis.

Because EURUSD mostly trades in price channels on large time frames,
analysing trading channels first would be wise. I’ve marked the channels
of the monthly time frame in ascending order based on their lifespan in
the chart above. The first order channel is the oldest. It’s based on
the [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) extremums at 0.823 and 1.605. These levels are the
strongest and they are marked with the strongest resistance and support
for market participants. The 5 order channel is the youngest and shows a
clear negative incline. The channels 2, 3 and 4 have the same incline.
This simple analysis highlights the main trading levels and lets us
conclude that the market is bearish. There’s no real bullish channel on
the 1-month time frame.

The last one was broken by March’s failure (marked with the blue
circle). This weak level is being tested and its critical value is
exactly at 1.08.

months][4]

The chart above shows the same 1-month time frame, with emphasis placed
on the current situation. A very important level is marked here - the
closure at 1.0517 in 2016 (see the red line). This level is located
exactly at the third support level of the Pivot indicator built
according to the Fibonacci ratios. At the same time, this level is in
the middle of the tolerance zone of the candlestick annual projection
(pink triangle). Before entering the tolerance zone, EURUSD soared to
almost the maximum of the projection in March (the upper edge of the
grey rectangle). So, we can say there’s bullish sentiment in a
candlestick forming on the 12-month time frame (candlestick of 2020).
That’s why exit and consolidation below the level of 1.026 are very
unlikely.  Still, this picture suggests a prospect of testing the level
of 1.0517 this year.

months][5]

On the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame, we see the following picture:  EURUSD is
consolidating and forming an equilateral triangle. The frontal volume
indicator shows that the main trading volume is in the range of 1.09 -
1.077. The horizontal volume indicator points to buyers’ strong
positions below 1.08. The ticker hasn’t consolidated below this value
yet, which means this is an active support level, even if many breakouts
have weakened it. The price is currently located below the equilibrium
value of the Pivot indicator which suggests a fall too.

###  **Actual scenario**

Based on the analysis above, falling below the key level of 1.08 won’t
be easy. Most likely, consolidation will continue within the range of
1.09 - 1.08 until the end of May 2020.

months][6]

Let’s get back to the 1-month time frame and have a closer look at the
candlesticks of the past 4 months. Each of them has long shadows below
which approached the middle of the range at the very least, or even took
most of the candlestick’s space. May’s last candlestick is far from
closing and it has some time left for offsetting the fall and repeating
the movement fractal of its predecessors.  The middle of May’s trading
range is located exactly near 1.09.

However, the triangle is still more likely to be broken from above on
the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame. This probability is even higher in June (see the
previous chart).  If this scenario is true, the nearest support levels
will be at 1.07-1.06. When it comes to medium-term trades, the perfect
position will be selling from 1.09 with intermediate targets at 1.08 /
1.07 / 1.06. Fix profits when the support level at 1.0517 gets closer.
Fix losses when the triangle is broken out from below. The most actual
level will be at around 1.095 then.
