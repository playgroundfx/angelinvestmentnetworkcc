Gold: never say neverDmitri Demidenko

## The talks that the Fed can follow the way of the BoJ and the ECB
increase the demand for gold

Increased demand for the US dollar weighs on gold. The issue of the US-
China trade war hasn’t been settled down, and the risks of the second
wave of the pandemic and the long time it should take the global GDP to
recover increase the demand for safe-havens. The market is scared, and
it for the first time bets on the Fed’s rate cut below zero. According
to the FOMC officials, this scenario is either extremely unlikely or
impossible. However, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s stick to a wise saying “never say never”.

According to BofA Securities, the [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) market has increased the
chance of the Fed’s rate cut below zero by late December from 9%-10% to
23% in a week. The CME derivatives indicated the interest rate cut into
the negative area until the FOMC officials started to actively reject
such a possibility. According to Atlanta Fed’s president Raphael Bostic
and St. Louis Fed’s president James Bullard, the Fed has other tools to
manage the situation. Bullard notes the ultra-easy monetary policies of
other central banks have produced a little effect in this sphere, and
the difference in the structure of short-term lending markets in the
USA, Japan, and Europe makes it difficult to use negative interest rates
in the USA. In fact, not only [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s and banks could suffer, but the
entire industry of the US financial funds as well. Therefore, the cure
can do more harm than the illness. The rate cut below zero aims at
increasing the domestic demand, but it can’t make people, scared by the
pandemic, go away and spend money.

Jerome Powell, who earlier claimed that the negative borrowing costs
will hardly support the US economy, is expected to return to this topic
in his speech on May 13. This could support the greenback and press down
gold. However, the funds flow into gold [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/)s is growing, which signals
that [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are willing to put up with a short-term drop and believe
in the [XAU/USD][1] rally in the future. Over almost five past months,
the capital inflow in the [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/)s has reached about $14.5 billion,
exceeding the yearly performance in 2009. The capital inflow into the
biggest [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/), SPDR Gold Shares, has been the greatest over the past 11
years.

Never say never. Not long ago, the Fed opposed Donald Trump’s calls to
lower the interest rates to the levels of Germany and Japan, so that the
US economy could be an efficient competitor to these countries. The
longer lasts the pandemic, the higher is the chance of the federal funds
rate cut below zero. Also because the US President again criticizes
Jerome Powell and his fellow central bankers.

Yes, the dollar smile theory can still work out, and this increases the
chance of the gold price correction. Therefore, I stick to my
[forecast][3] for the [XAU/USD][1] consolidation in the range of
1635-1775. Nonetheless, the main scenario still suggests buying gold
when the price is being corrected down.
