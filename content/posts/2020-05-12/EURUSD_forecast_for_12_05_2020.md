Euro is dangerously close to the lineDmitri Demidenko

## Geopolitics and growing risks of a constitutional crisis weigh on the
EUR/USD

If the greenback is strengthening amid the rally of the US stock
indexes, how deep could the [EUR/USD][1] drop if the S&P 500 trend turns
down? The buyers of stocks are not discouraged by the bad [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) from
Germany about s surge in the new cases of coronavirus as the economy was
partially reopened, growing pessimism about the recovery of the US GDP,
or by a potential escalation of the US-China trade war. Besides, the
euro is pressed down by the turmoil in the EU judicial system that might
result in a constitutional crisis.

The major growth driver for the S&P 500 is the unwillingness of
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s to go against the Fed that is actively stimulating the US
economy. They hope that corporate profits will be 13% up in the first
quarter of 2021. Besides, analysts suggest a chance that the US stock
indexes could rise to all-time highs (JP Morgan, for example, says it
will occur in the first half of 2021). Investors are bullish on the
sector leaders that, unlike other companies’ stocks, are growing
steadily. In fact, the US economic rebound to the pre-crisis pace may be
U-, W-, Z- or L-shaped. Investors more often support the idea that the
US GDP won’t quickly rebound. It could take months or even years.

One of the drivers of the US stocks sell-off and the growth of the
demand for safe-havens, including the US dollar, can be the escalation
of the US-China trade war. Washington and Beijing seem to have agreed on
the fulfilling obligations under the trade deal signed in January, and
China is starting to increase purchases of US soy and pork, reducing
Brazilian and Australian imports of these products, but there are
distressing talks among [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s. Allegedly, China has ended with
diplomacy and is switching to the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of bullying. In response to the
charges of the alleged laboratory origin of COVID-19, the Chinese
officials point to the elderly coronavirus patients abandoned in
France's nursing homes. Also, China’s media spread conspiracy theories
suggesting that the USA created the virus to destroy China. China also
threatens to block the imports of Australia’s goods as Canberra is going
to investigate the virus origins; it also encourages Wellington and
Prague for public praise by donating masks and equipment.

Beijing behaves as it did after the 2007-2009 crisis when China was
going to outperform the U.S. and Europe. Donald Trump doesn’t like it.
He says he is going to halt the further talks with China and should
revise the provisions of the phase-one trade deal signed in January.

In addition to the potential sell-offs in the stock market and
geopolitical issues, there are disputes between the EU members.
Therefore, the [EUR/USD][1] is getting more likely to drop below the
important support at 1.077-1.0775. After a tough response of the
European Court to the German constitutional court, the European
Commission could open a legal case against Germany over the violating EU
legislation. The situation is alarming. Will the euro stay on the edge
of the abyss?
