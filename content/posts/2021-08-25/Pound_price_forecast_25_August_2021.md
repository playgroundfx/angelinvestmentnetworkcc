Pound depends on dollar. Forecast as of 25.08.2021Dmitri Demidenko

A slowdown in the UK economy can cause a reduction in the rate of the
Bank of England's monetary normalization to a minimum. In such a
situation, much in the fate of [GBPUSD][1] begins to depend on the Fed.
Let us discuss the market outlook and make up a trading plan

## Weekly pound fundamental forecast

Times change. Once the pound was popular among buyers due to the
accelerated vaccination. The UK is now among the leaders in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of the
fully vaccinated population. At the same time, the slower increase in
the number of COVID-19 cases in Britain compared to the United States
does not worry [GBPUSD][1] traders. The government is doing everything
possible to accelerate economic growth. Despite the opening of the
economy, British citizens are in no hurry to spend money.

What are the reasons for the slowdown in British inflation from 2.5% to
2%, the unexpected decline in retail sales by 2.5% for Bloomberg
experts, and the drop in the composite purchasing managers' index to a
6-month low? Is it all because of fears of the Delta variant or an
increased interest in the England national team at Euro 2020? Or is it
all due to the bad weather? According to Berenberg, the shortage of
staff is a bigger problem for the UK than COVID-19. Pantheon
Macroeconomics notes that supply is not the only bottleneck. Domestic
demand and export problems are starting to emerge. In the latter case,
Brexit is one of the reasons.

The slowdown in the economy could make adjustments to the BoE's plans to
get rid of monetary stimulus. Andrew Bailey and his colleagues intend to
raise the interest rate from 0.1% to 0.25% in 2022, and to 0.5% by the
end of 2023, after which they will stop reinvesting bond income. The BoE
balance will stabilize, and then will begin to decline due to the active
sale of securities with an increase in the rate to 1%. Monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
normalization is proceeding slowly. At the same time, the Delta variant
and the associated GDP slowdown can significantly affect the decrease in
the rate of normalization to the minimum.

The problem with [GBPUSD][1] bulls is that the market has long been
determined to raise the interest rate in 2022, while the idea of
​​raising the federal funds rate next year is relatively recent. This
fact made traders turn their eyes to the US dollar and contributed to
the fall of the analyzed pair to the February lows. In addition, hedge
funds are reconsidering their views on COVID-19. Earlier, thanks to
vaccines, a quick victory over the pandemic was expected, which made it
possible to buy those currencies where vaccination is faster. Today
there is no such confidence.

### Weekly [GBPUSD][1] trading plan

In my opinion, whether old ideas come back or disappear depends on the
Fed's plans. If the Fed does everything right, the economy will continue
to grow, the labor market will recover, and inflation will slow down. On
the contrary, too fast or slow normalization of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) will
cause an economic recession or an unrestrained price increase. In this
regard, the speech of the head of the central bank in Jackson Hole is of
the utmost importance for all dollar pairs. Jerome Powell's lack of fear
of COVID-19 will encourage the [GBPUSD][1] bears to move ahead. Level
1.374 serves as a kind of limit for the pair. The inability of the bulls
to consolidate at the beforementioned level is a sign of their weakness
and a reason for sales.
