Euro is at the back of the line. Forecast as of 25.08.2021Dmitri
Demidenko

The [EURUSD][1] could go up amid the rumours about Jerome Powell’s fears
of the Delta. However, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s will hardly be misled. The Fed will act
according to the plan. Let us discuss the Forex outlook and make up a
trading plan.

## Weekly euro fundamental forecast

Investors should be flexible in the constantly changing market and
regularly review their trading ideas. The reversal of the [EURUSD][1]
uptrend in June resulted not only from the change in the Fed’s tone but
also from a global reassessment of the optimistic story about a soon
victory over COVID-19, which would lead to an acceleration in global
GDP. The pandemic will hardly end soon, so it is not relevant to buy the
euro, at least now.

Amid disappointing data on business activity in various regions of the
world, JP Morgan downgraded its forecast for global economic growth in
the third quarter by 2.3% to 6%. Despite the moderate optimism of
purchasing managers from Europe, the problems in Asia will slow down the
global growth. While China quickly stopped the coronavirus outbreak, its
GDP is still slowing down as neighbouring countries have to impose
lockdowns due to the Delta. If China is in trouble, it will have a
negative influence on export-led Germany’s economy. So, there will be
another reason why the ECB will maintain its ultra-soft monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
for a long time.

While many of the world's central banks are poised to move towards
normalization, Christine Lagarde and her colleagues are at the back of
the line. Investors realize that they will not get the same
profitability in Europe as, for example, in the United States, where the
Fed can raise rates fourfold by the end of 2023. This is the opinion of
Nordea, which predicts a fall in [EURUSD][1] to 1.1.

Analysts revised the scenario of the Fed’s passive approach and a quick
victory over COVID-19, encouraging hedge funds to sell the euro. The
euro speculative shorts are close to the highs of 2020 when [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s
were willing to buy the US dollar because of the global recession.

### Dynamics of euro speculative positions

The euro should have strengthened against such a safe-haven asset as the
US dollar, as the [S&P 500][2] has hit its 50th record high in 2021.
However, the US stock market is rising for different reasons. The US
drug regulator granted full approval to the Pfizer Inc/BioNTech COVID-19
vaccine. Furthermore, the House of Representatives approved a $3.5
trillion budget blueprint that clears the way for Democrats in Congress
to take action on a sweeping package. The USA has easy access to
COVID-19 vaccines, and the US economy will grow rapidly thanks to the
generosity of legislators. The US exclusivity is in action, and the
greenback is back on top.

### Weekly [EURUSD][1] trading plan

The approval of the vaccines increases the likelihood that domestic
demand in the United States will increase in direct proportion to the
growth in the fully vaccinated population. This will allow Jerome Powell
not to associate the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) with the spread of the Delta, as
Robert Kaplan did. Therefore, the [EURUSD][1] will continue falling.
Aggressive traders could consider entering shorts when the price breaks
out the support zone of 1.172-1.1725. All the rest could wait for
Powell’s speech in Jackson Hole.
