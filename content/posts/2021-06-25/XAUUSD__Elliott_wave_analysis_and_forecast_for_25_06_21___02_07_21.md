XAUUSD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 25.06.21 – 02.07.21Alex
Geuta

 **Main scenario:** long positions will be relevant above the level of
1674.46 with a target of 1958.14 – 2016.10 after correction.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
1674.46 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of
1568.91 – 1447.92.

 **Analysis:** an ascending third wave of a larger degree (3) formed in
the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame, and a descending correction developed as wave (4),
supposedly. The fifth wave (5) appears to be forming in the H4 time
frame, with the first wave of smaller degree 1 of (5) formed and the
downward correction 2 of (5) developing inside. In the H1 time frame,
there is developing wave с of 2, with the fifth wave (v) of с unfolding
inside. If the presumption is correct, the pair will continue to rise to
the levels of 1958.14 – 2016.10 after the correction finishes. The level
of 1674.46 is critical in this scenario as the breakout will enable the
pair to continue declining to the levels of 1568.91 – 1447.92.
