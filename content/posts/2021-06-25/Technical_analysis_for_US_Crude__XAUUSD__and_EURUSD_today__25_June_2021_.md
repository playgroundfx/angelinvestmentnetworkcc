Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 25.06.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

The gold price hasn't broken out the short-term downtrend's key
resistance of 1794 - 1783.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

The short-term oil trend is up. Yesterday, the traders tried to break
out the Additional Zone 72.71 - 72.58. It was unsuccessful on the first
try.

Keep looking for a buy pattern today. A breakout of the resistance level
of 73.37 and price consolidation higher are required for a buy pattern
formation.

Otherwise, if the Additional Zone is broken out, switch to oil sales
with the target in the Intermediary Zone 71.39 - 71.12.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

Open buy positions according to the pattern in 72.71 - 72.58.
TakeProfit: 73.64. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

The gold price hasn't broken out the short-term downtrend's key
resistance of 1794 - 1783. It means it is profitable to look for sales
according to the pattern with the target at level 1762. It is necessary
to break out the support level of 1774 for the pattern formation.

To switch to gold purchases, it is necessary to break out the resistance
level of 1794. In this case, you can enter a trade at market price with
the target at the Target Zone 1810 - 1805.

The probability of a gold price fall is significantly higher than the
probability of growth.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

Open sell positions according to the pattern in 1794 - 1783. TakeProfit:
1762. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

The euro short-term uptrend with the target at the Target Zone 1.2041 -
1.2023 continues. Yesterday, traders tested the Additional Zone 1.1926 -
1.1921. There was a recommendation to enter purchases according to the
pattern at the beforementioned support. The double bottom pattern was
formed yesterday. Today it should yield profits. The first target for
purchases is the June 23 high at 1.1968.

If the price breaks out the Additional Zone and level 1.1917 the buy
scenario will be canceled. In this case, it would be necessary to open a
short trade with the target in the Intermediary Zone 1.1882 - 1.1873.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

Hold up purchases according to the pattern in the zone of 1.1926 -
1.1917. TakeProfit: 1.1968, Target Zone 1.2041 - 1.2023. StopLoss: at
the breakeven.
