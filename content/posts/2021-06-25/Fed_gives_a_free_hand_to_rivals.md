Central banks and forbidden fruit. Review as of 25.06.2021Dmitri

The Fed bit the apple of monetary tightening, and the rest want to do
the same

## Fed gives a free hand to rivals

Eve had the first tantrum when Adam ate the whole forbidden fruit, which
she had just slightly bitten. However, the Fed has hardly got upset when
other central banks rushed to raise interest rates after the US
regulator had announced an earlier timeframe for the monetary tightening
in the US, shifting the forecast for the first rate hike from 2024 to
2023. The Hungarian central bank raised its base rate by 30 basis points
for the first time over almost ten years. Central banks of the Czech
Republic and Mexico raised the interest rates by 25 basis points. The
[news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) from Mexico came completely out of the blue for [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s. The
forbidden fruit is really sweet, you can't eat one piece!

In fact, the Fed, having bitten the apple of tightening monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/),
has given a free hand to rivals to fight the rising inflation. Those who
had been afraid of strengthening their local currencies followed the
footsteps of the Fed and started raising the rates, looking at the surge
of the US dollar. Those who hadn’t cared about the strength of their
national currencies began eating the forbidden fruit earlier than the
Fed. Some of them are going even further. The Russian central bank, for
example, has raised the key interest rate by as much as 50 basis points.

Of course, a change in the Fed’s [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) stance has shocked financial
markets. Before the June meeting, the Fed had seemed to be one the most
peaceful central banks. A kind of animal that can’t jump.

Investors were betting on reflation – US growth and the Fed's
willingness to let the economy overheat. After the Fed demonstrated that
it could start jumping much earlier than people think, reflation trade
plummeted, strengthening the US dollar. The dollar’s further trend
depends not only on the events going on in the US but also on the
actions of other central banks, which are set free now.

>  _-_ The Fed decided to raise the rate in 2023, not in 2024, Sir.

The taper tantrum of 2013 hasn’t happened (Ben Bernanke announced
tapering of the US QE). EMs’ stocks didn’t crash, and their currencies
didn’t drop, US Treasury yield didn’t skyrocket. Everything was
relatively calm, but for the Forex market. This is taper calm rather
than a taper tantrum! Now, the world’s central banks are queuing to
follow the Fed’s footsteps. Is there going to be a crowd? I decided to
put on some make-up, as I was in a traffic jam. But the traffic jam was
strange. Everyone stood behind me ...

Analysts say that it was Jerome Powell who prevented the market from the
tantrum, as the Fed officials masterly prepared [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s for the
important change. I personally see it as a simple cheat. First, the
central bank promises to maintain its ultra-easy monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) for
long years ahead and then announces that the rate might be raised
already in 2022. Markets are like a fiance who found out that his bride
had been cheating:

> How was your wedding night?

>

> I don’t remember, I fainted right after she had washed off her make-
up!
