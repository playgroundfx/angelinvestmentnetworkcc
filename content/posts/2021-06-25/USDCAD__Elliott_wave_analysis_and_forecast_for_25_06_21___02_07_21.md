USDCAD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 25.06.21 – 02.07.21Alex
Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider short positions below the level of 1.2712
with a target of 1.1850 – 1.1700 once the correction is completed.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
1.2712 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 1.2873 –
1.3405.

 **Analysis:** Wave (С) of 4 of a larger degree continues developing in
the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) timeframe, with the third wave 3 of (C) formed inside. The
fifth wave v of 3 finished forming in the H4 time frame, with wave (v)
of v completed inside. In the H1 time frame, a descending correction
appears to be forming as the fourth wave 4 of (C), with wave a of 4
completed and wave b of 4 developing within. If the presumption is
correct, the pair will continue to fall to the levels of 1.1850 – 1.1700
once the correction is over. The level of 1.2712 is critical in this
scenario as a breakout will enable the pair to continue rising to the
levels of 1.2873 – 1.3405.
