EURUSD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 25.06.21 – 02.07.21Alex
Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 1 **.** 2032 with a target of 1.1600 – 1.1489.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
1 **.** 2032 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of
1.2500 – 1.2600.

 **Analysis:** Presumably, the first wave of larger degree 1 of (3)
formed, and a downside correction is forming as wave 2 of (3) in the
[daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) timeframe. Apparently, wave a of 2 and an ascending wave b of 2
formed in the H4 time frame. A descending wave c of 2 is developing in
the H1 time frame, with the third wave of a smaller degree (iii) of c
developing inside. If the presumption is correct, the pair will continue
to drop to the levels of 1.1600 – 1.1489. The level of 1.2032 is
critical in this scenario. Its breakout will allow the pair to continue
rising to the levels of 1.2500 – 1.2600.
