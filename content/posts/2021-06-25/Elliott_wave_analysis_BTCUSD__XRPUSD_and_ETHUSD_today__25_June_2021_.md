Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 25.06.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

Bitcoin and Ethereum should soon finish bullish corrections. Therefore,
the upward corrections will end, and the prices will resume declining.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

The descending wave (A) continues forming as a five-wave impulse
1-2-3-4-5. There is developing the final leg of the impulse, sub-wave 5.
Wave 5 is a bearish impulse of a smaller degree. There should be
unfolding the upward impulse (C) that could conclude correction [4]
within wave 5. After this correction finishes, the market will resume
declining in wave [5], as outlined in the chart. The Bitcoin price is
likely to go down to a level of 28780.00, the previous low.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Sell 34824.00, TP 28780.00

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

The XRPUSD market finished the bearish zigzag A-B-C. After the bearish
impulse C completed, the market has turned up and started forming a new
bullish trend. There could be unfolding a five-wave impulse
(1)-(2)-(3)-(4)-(5). There is developing wave (3), which could end at a
level of 0.783, the previous high made by correction 4.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] **** today:

Buy 0.678, TP 0.783

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

The ETHUSD market continues declining in a large impulse wave A. In the
most recent chart section, there is the final leg of wave A, sub-wave
[5]. The market is about to finish the upward zigzag-shaped correction
(4). After it finished, the price should resume moving down in the final
sub-wave (5) to a level of 1700.00, the previous low.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Sell 2010.45, TP 1700.00
