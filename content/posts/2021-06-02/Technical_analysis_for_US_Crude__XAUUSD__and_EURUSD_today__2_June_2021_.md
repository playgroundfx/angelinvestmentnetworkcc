Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 02.06.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

Yesterday, oil broke out the Target Zone 67.34 - 66.81.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

Yesterday, oil broke out the Target Zone 67.34 - 66.81. The short-term
trend is up. Consequently, the new target for purchases is the Gold Zone
69.73 - 69.46.

Yesterday, the price corrected to the Additional Zone 67.43 - 67.30.
While the zone is being held, it is profitable to look for purchases
according to the pattern. The main buy target will be to update the June
1st high.

A breakout of the Additional Zone is required for sales. In this case,
expect a correction to the trend key support 66.10 - 65.84.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

Buy according to the pattern in Additional Zone 67.43 - 67.30.
TakeProfit: 68.62. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

Gold price is correcting to a short-term uptrend and is currently
testing key support. The zone of 1894 - 1889 serves as a key support.
While the zone is being held, it is profitable to look for purchases
according to the pattern with the target at yesterday's high + Gold Zone
1923 - 1921.

If the key support is broken out, the trend will reverse down, so look
for sales to the lower Target Zone 1871 - 1867.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

Open buy positions according to the pattern in 1894 - 1889. TakeProfit:
1915. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

Yesterday, euro traders tried to break out the short-term downtrend's
key resistance but unsuccessful. The US trading session closed inside
the Intermediary Zone 1.2229 - 1.2220. For today, selling priority
remains. The target for sales is May 28 low. The second target is the
lower Target Zone 1.2090 - 1.2072.

A trend reversal up is required for purchases. To do this, buyers need
to break out the Intermediary Zone and close the price at the US trading
session higher. In this case, the target will be the upper Target Zone
1.2326 - 1.2308.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

Sell according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 1.2229 - 1.2220.
TakeProfit: 1.2134. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.
