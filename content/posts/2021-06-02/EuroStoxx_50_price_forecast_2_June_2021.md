EuroStoxx 50 increases the lead. Forecast as of 02.06.2021Dmitri
Demidenko

Europe attracts [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s' attention due to the issue of European bonds
by the EU, understated estimates, and the high share of value and
cyclical stocks in the structure of stock indices. Let's discuss how
this affects [EuroStoxx 50][1] and make up a trading plan.

## Fundamental EuroStoxx 50 forecast for a year

Stability is a sign of skill. For several weeks now, US stock indices
have been trading near record highs without correction. It's easy to
explain. This market is driven by cheap liquidity from the Fed and often
ignores bad [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/). At the same time, fears about accelerating inflation,
overvaluation, and problems of technology companies keep [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s on
their toes. Many of these difficulties have bypassed the European stock
market. Is this why [EuroStoxx 50][1] performs better in 2021 than the
[S&P 500][2]?

Since the beginning of the year, the EuroStoxx 50 index has grown by
about 15%. In the first five months, it outperformed the S&P 500, for
the first time since 2017. Judging by Bloomberg EuroStoxx 50 consensus
forecast of 4012 at the end of 2021, experts have little faith in the
European stock market. Absolutely in vain!

While [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are hesitant to buy US stocks that look overvalued,
European stocks do not have these problems. [EuroStoxx 50's][1] P/E
Ratio is 17.6, [S&P 500's][2] is 21, [Nasdaq Composite's][3] is 26.
EuroStoxx 50 is dominated by value and cyclical stocks, not technology
ones. This makes STOXX purchases more preferable compared to US
counterparts amid the global economic recovery after the recession.

### Stock indices P/E dynamics

According to the OECD forecasts, in 2022 the eurozone's GDP will grow by
4.4%, while the US GDP will increase by only 3.6%. US inflation is
accelerating faster than the European one, which reduces the likelihood
of an earlier start to the ECB monetary normalization compared to the
Fed. Finally, Joe Biden's administration plans to raise taxes, which
allows for the expectation that corporate profits of European issuers
will exceed the results of North American companies.

The EU officials have clarified the situation with the issue of bonds to
finance the costs of the EU Recovery and Resilience Facility, which may
compete with US Treasury obligations. Brussels intends to start emission
in June and bring it up to €80 billion by the end of this year, and up
to €150 billion a year from mid-2021 to 2026. This money will allow the
eurozone to increase fiscal stimulus, which will have a beneficial
effect on its economy and European stock indices.

Thus, there are plenty of reasons to expect the [EuroStoxx 50][1] to
outperform the [S&P 500][2] in the medium term. Isn't that why,
according to the BofA Merrill Lynch study, that 194 global [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s
have the largest preponderance of European shares in their portfolios in
the world compared to the average values ​​of the indicator? Isn't that
why, there is an inflow of capital from investment funds focused on
Europe of $4.8 billion in 2021 after the $43 billion outflow in 2020?

In my opinion, the potential of the [EuroStoxx 50][1] rally is far from
being exhausted. I recommend continuing to buy EuroStoxx 50 stocks with
[previously][4] set targets at 4180 and 4520.
