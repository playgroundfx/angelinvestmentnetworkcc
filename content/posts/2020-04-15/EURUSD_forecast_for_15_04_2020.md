Dollar: where are you rushing?Dmitri Demidenko

## The US economy might completely recover by July

Investors are willing to buy US stocks despite the deepest recession of
the global economy since the 1930s, horrible corporate reports and
record growth of the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) death rate in the USA. Everybody remembers
that the stocks rally usually starts long before the end of the
recession. Especially since Donald Trump claims that the US economy
should be partially reopened by May 1. President Donald Trump’s top
economic adviser Larry Kudlow hopes that they will be able to open the
economy in the next four to eight. It means that the US GDP should
rebound by July.

According to the IMF projections, global GDP will contract by 3% in
2020, instead of the expansion by 3.3% expected in January. Losses are
estimated at $ 2.7 trillion, and significantly exceed the global losses
that took place in 2009. Then, the global economy contracted by 0.1%,
and about 40 countries averted the recession due to China. At present,
there will be less than 10% of such countries. The IMF expects a
“partial recovery” by 5.8% in 2021, but still, it will be the weakest
two-year period since the 1980s. The IMF expects the US economy to
contract by 5.9% this year, the euro area is expected to shrink by 7.5%
(the losses were 2.5% and 4.5% respectively in 2009).

In general, IMF forecasts were not so gloomy as to discourage [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s
from buying the US stocks.

Ahead of the start of the corporate reporting season in the U.S., there
were talks that the horrible data should discourage the buyers of the
stock indexes. This isn’t so, in fact. The decline in JP Morgan Chase
revenues by almost 70% and Wells Fargo by 89% did not bother buyers. On
April 14, the Dow Jones, S&P 500 and Nasdaq were up at 19%, 16% and 13%,
close to their [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) peaks. The rally of the US stock indexes
encourages speculators to sell the major safe-haven asset, the US
dollar. In the week through April 7, the net shorts on the US dollar in
the derivatives market increased to the highest level since 2018.

Looking at the S&P 500 rally, I remember Horace’s words “Where are you
rushing, madmen — where?”. The recovery of the US economy can take a far
longer time since, after the crisis, the corporate loan market will face
the need to compete with the public sector for [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s. In fact, a
huge fiscal stimulus and the decrease in budget revenues due to
coronavirus will result in the need to increase the volume of Treasuries
issuance from 2.1% of GDP on average in the post-war period to 20.6% of
GDP.

After all, the fear of missing out pushes the S&P 500 and the
[EUR/USD][3] up. The euro broke out the resistance at $1.0965, and, if
the price is consolidated above, it can well go up to $1.1055. However,
the US stock market looks like a huge bubble now, which can burst at any
moment.
