Analysis for oil, gold, and EUR/USD for 15.04.2020Alex Rodiоnov

###  **USCrude – oil**

There wasn’t a buy pattern in the middle-term uptrend. The key support
has been broken out downside today. Now, the downside target is Target
Zone 2 [17.69 - 17.13]. The border of the middle-term downtrend is in
the zone of [27.23 — 26.56].

Oil is still trading in the short-term downtrend. Gold Zone [20.249 –
20.21] was tested yesterday. Traders are trying to break it out today.
If they succeed, the next downside target Target Zone 2 [17.69 – 17.13].

Strong resistances are now:

  1. Additional Zone [21.70 - 21.53].

  2. Intermediary Zone [23.54 — 23.21].

One may enter sell trades according to the patterns in these resistance
zones. If any of the zones is broken out upside, we shall buy oil up to
the next margin zone one degree higher.

###  **XAUUSD – gold**

New margin requirements for gold futures operate starting form today. We
shall draw new margin zones based on new extremes hit today.

As for the trends...The middle-term trend is upward. Buyers were trying
to reach Target Zone 5 [1757.2 – 1751.2] yesterday. There were just a
few pips left to the target.

The price is now being corrected. We shall look for new buy entries at
good prices.

The local short-term trend is up. Target Zone 2 [1743.6 - 1735.3] was
reached yesterday. The price is now being corrected getting close to the
trend key support [1705.7 – 1701.5].

For today, I suggest expecting the test of Intermediary Zone, watching
traders’ reaction and looking for a buy pattern. The buy target will be
at the local high.

It will be relevant to sell gold if the price breaks out IZ and
consolidates below. In this case, the trend will turn down, and the sell
target will be the lower Target Zone [1663.9 — 1655.6].

 **[XAUUSD][6] Trading ideas for today: **

Buy according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone [1705.7 - 1701.5].
TakeProfit: 1746.5. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

###  **EURUSD – euro/dollar**

In the medium-term EUR/USD price chart, traders are trying to turn the
middle-term downtrend up. The US session closed the price above Target
Zone [1.0957 – 1.0940] yesterday. But this is not enough. The price
should be once again closed above the resistance or break through the
yesterday’s high. The buy target will be Target Zone 2 [1.1129 —
1.1112].

![LiteForex: Analysis for oil, gold, and EUR/USD for 15.04.2020][7]

The EURUSD short-term trend is up. Buyers broke out the resistance
Target Zone [1.0957 – 1.0940] and consolidated the price above
yesterday. Now, the upside target is Gold Zone [1.1035 - 1.1026].

Look for buy entries on the correction towards strong supports, such as
Additional Zone [1.0944 - 1.0940] and Intermediary Zone [1.0899 -
1.0890]. After any of these supports is tested, look for a buy patterns.

I don’t recommend selling the eurusd until IZ is broken out downside.
