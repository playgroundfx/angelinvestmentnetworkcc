Forex plays a gambitDmitri Demidenko

##  **Forex gambit strategy: peculiarities and us** **age** ****

There is always some uncertainty in the market. The higher it is, the
higher volatility is, and vice versa. In a time of small volatility of
quotes and a clear bullish / bearish trend,  traders only need to  hold
what they bought / sold. But during high volatility periods, they need
to be prepared for sharp market fluctuations. Volatility helps us choose
the right work strategy and that’s why volatility-based indicators are
popular with traders.

Let’s take [Bollinger Bands](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/bollinger-bands.html). Its dynamic support/resistance lines are
built using standard deviations. They get larger automatically when
volatility is high and they get narrower when the market gets stable.

[Bollinger Bands](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/bollinger-bands.html) is the basis of many [trading strategies](https://www.fintechee.com/forex-trading-strategies/). We are going to
examine one of them - Forex Gambit. Its author is Walter T. Downs. In
chess, a gambit is the sacrifice of a figure or a pawn with the hope of
improving position. Traders must be ready to lose some money hoping that
the market will finally go in the necessary direction and their
positions will improve.

The main factors of this strategy are 30-period [Bollinger Bands](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/bollinger-bands.html) with 1-2
deviations and a signal bar. The latter must comply with the following
conditions in a bullish market:

> \- the minimum is lower than the previous bar’s minimum;

>

> \- the maximum is lower than the previous bar’s maximum;

>

> \- closure above the central line of [Bollinger Bands](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/bollinger-bands.html);

>

> \- closure below the upper line of [Bollinger Bands](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/bollinger-bands.html) with deviation 1;

>

> \- closure above the middle of the previous bar’s trading range.

A trader had a chance to get prepared for a trade when signal bars had
appeared twice in the H4 chart of [USD/CHF][1].

To open a long position, a pending order is used. It’s activated at the
level of the signal bar’s maximum. A protective stop order is placed at
the level of the signal bar’s minimum minus a few points. The author
recommends that a position be hold 2 days at least, or 8 hours for the
H4 time frame. If a long position hasn’t got positive, exit it “at
market”.  A stop order must be moved to a breakeven point three days
later (12 hours later for the H4 time frame).

A long position should be closed after the currency pair has reached the
upper line of [Bollinger Bands](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/bollinger-bands.html) with deviation 2 and a bar closed on the
lows has formed there.

The main characteristics of a signal bar in a bearish market are as
follows:

> \- the maximum is higher than the previous bar’s maximum;

>

> \- the minimum is higher than the previous bar’s minimum;

>

> \- closure below the central line of [Bollinger Bands](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/bollinger-bands.html);

>

> \- closure above the lower line of [Bollinger Bands](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/bollinger-bands.html) with deviation 1;

>

> \- closure below the middle of the previous bar’s trading range.

A signal to sell [USD/JPY][5] occurred when the quotes fell below the
signal bar’s minimum. Then a stop order got activated at the level of
its maximum plus a few points. Twelve hours later, the stop order moved
to a breakeven point. According to the rules, a trader was supposed to
fix profits once a bar closed on the highs formed near the lower limit
of [Bollinger Bands](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/bollinger-bands.html) with deviation 2.

Forex Gambit belongs to trend recovery strategies. Traders consider
actual market volatility and run insignificant risks because a stop
order is narrow.
