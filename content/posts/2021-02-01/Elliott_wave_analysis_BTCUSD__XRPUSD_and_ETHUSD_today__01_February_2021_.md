Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 01.02.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

Ethereum and Bitcoin are forming corrective sub-waves. Bitcoin is
developing a triple zigzag, and Ethereum is forming a skewed triangle.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

The BTCUSD market is forming corrective wave 4 as a bearish triple
zigzag. The second linking upwave [X] must have completed. The market is
now declining in the final motive wave [Z] that is unfolding as a simple
zigzag (a)-(b)-(c). There must have finished the bearish impulse (a) and
the bearish correction (b). Therefore, the price should be falling in
impulse (c) to a level of 28900.00.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Sell 33533.50 TP 28900.00

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

The chart displays the initial part of the large impulse wave. Wave (1)
has completed as a bullish impulse. The bearish corrective wave (2) has
finished as a zigzag a-b-c, where wave a is an impulse, b is a double
zigzag, c is an ending diagonal. There is forming the initial element of
the impulse wave (3). The first sub-wave of impulse (3) seems to have
completed, so the market should be running down in correction 2 to a
level of 0.378 during this week. At this level, wave 2 will be 50% of
wave 1.

### Trading plan for **[XRPUSD][2]** today:

Sell 0.538, TP 0.378

## Elliott wave Ethereum analysis

The ETHUSD market is forming the upward impulse wave C, namely its final
sub-wave (5) of [5]. In the bullish impulse (5), there is forming a
horizontal corrective wave 4 as a skewed triangle, as its constructing
lines are directed up, as well as the main trend. The sub-wave [E] will
conclude the triangle pattern. The [E] wave is unfolding as a double
zigzag, where the impulse wave c of the final zigzag (y) is forming. The
c impulse should end at a level of 1170.00. Next, the market should turn
up and start rising in wave 5.

### Trading plan for  **[ETHUSD][3] **today:

Sell 1304.74, TP 11170.00
