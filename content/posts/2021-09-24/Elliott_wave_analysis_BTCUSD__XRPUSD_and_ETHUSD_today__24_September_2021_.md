Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 24.09.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

The market continues forming descending impulses for all cryptocurrency
pairs covered in the article.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

The BTCUSD market continues forming the descending impulse wave. Sub-
waves 1 and 2 completed in the new potential impulse. At the time of
writing, sub-waves [1] and [2] have finished in the third wave. The
market should continue declining in sub-wave [3] to a level below
37233.00. I recommend entering short trades with a target at the above-
indicated level.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Sell 44218.28, TP 37233.00

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

The XRPUSD market is forming the initial part of the simple down impulse
with the first two sub-waves 1 and 2 completed within. There is now
unfolding the third sub-wave, namely its middle leg, impulse [3]. The
price should be moving in waves (3)-(4)-(5) to a level below 0.805.
Therefore, it is recommended to enter sell trades in the current
situation.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] **** today:

Sell 0.975, TP 0.805

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

The ETHUSD market is forming the new down wave as a bearish impulse.
There is now forming wave 3, which could also be an impulse
[1]-[2]-[3]-[4]-[5], as is outlined in the chart. The market should be
declining to a level of 2520.00. Next, following a short upward
correction [4], the market will continue declining to lower levels. One
should enter sell trades in the current situation.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Sell 3069.95, TP 2520.00
