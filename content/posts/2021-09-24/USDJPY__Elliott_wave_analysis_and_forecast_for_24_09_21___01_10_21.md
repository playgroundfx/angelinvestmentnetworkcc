USDJPY: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 24.09.21 – 01.10.21Alex
Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 111.68 with a target of 107.16 – 106.07.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
111.68 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 113.50 –
115.00.

 **Analysis:** Daily chart: apparently, a descending correction of
larger degree finished forming as wave B, and wave С started developing,
with the first wave (1) of С forming inside. The third wave of smaller
degree 3 of (1) continues developing on the H4 chart, with wave i of 3
formed and a downside correction developing as wave ii of 3 inside. On
the H1 chart, wave (b) of ii appears to be finishing development with
wave c of (b) forming inside. If the presumption is correct, then after
wave (b) of ii is formed, the pair will continue to drop to the levels
of 107.16 – 106.07. The level of 111.68 is critical in this scenario as
a breakout will enable the pair to continue growing to the levels of
113.50 – 115.00.
