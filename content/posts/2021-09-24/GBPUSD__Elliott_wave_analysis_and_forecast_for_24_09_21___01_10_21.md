GBPUSD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 24.09.21 – 01.10.21Alex
Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 1.3920 with a target of 1.3400 – 1.3157.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
1.3920 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 1.4050 –
1.4241.

 **Analysis:** Daily chart: the first wave of larger degree (1) is
formed and a downside correction continues forming as wave (2). H4
chart: wave А of (2) is completed and wave B of (2) appears to have
formed, with wave c of B formed inside. Apparently, wave C of (2)
started developing on the H1 chart with wave i of C formed inside. If
the presumption is correct, then after the local correction in the form
of wave ii of C is completed, the pair will continue declining to the
levels of 1.3400 – 1.3157. The level of 1.3920 is critical in this
scenario as a breakout will enable the pair to continue rising to the
levels of 1.4050 – 1.4241.
