Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 24.09.21Alex Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

Euro was trading in an upward correction in the short-term downtrend
yesterday.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

The oil market reached the resistance level of 72.67 and broke out
Target Zone 72.85 – 72.32 yesterday. The short-term uptrend continues.
The next upside target is Gold Zone 75.12 — 74.87.

One should enter new oil purchases on the corrections to strong support
levels: Additional Zone 72.27 – 72.14 and Intermediary Zone 70.99 -
70.74. Before you enter a buy, there should be a buy pattern, for
example, a false breakout. A part of profits could be taken at the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/)
high.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

  1. Buy according to the pattern in Additional Zone 72.27 - 72.14. TakeProfit: 73.50. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. Buy according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 70.99 - 70.74. TakeProfit: 73.50. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

The gold market broke out Intermediary Zone 1766 – 1764 yesterday. There
was no buy pattern. The short-term trend turned down. The price reached
Target Zone 1746 – 1741. Therefore, all the gold trading patterns have
been worked out.

The price is being corrected up in the short-term downtrend. The
correction target is to test Intermediary Zone 1760 – 1758. After the
zone’s test, one could enter sell trades with a target at yesterday’s
low.

If the gold price breaks out Intermediary Zone and consolidates above at
the US session, the trend will turn up. In this case, it will be
relevant to buy starting from Monday.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

Sell according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 1760 - 1758.
TakeProfit: 1739. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

The EURUSD was being corrected up in the short-term downtrend yesterday.
The trend border is at level 1.1744. This level is a little higher than
Additional Zone 1.1732 – 1.1727; so, one could enter sell trades in the
range between AZ and trend border.

Today, I suggest entering short-term sell trades in the zone of 1.1744 –
1.1727 with a target around yesterday’s low 1.1687.

It will be relevant to buy if the price breaks out level 1.1744 and
consolidates above. In this case, the market could test Intermediary
Zone 1.1780 — 1.1771.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

Sell according to the pattern in the zone of 1.1744 - 1.1727.
TakeProfit: 1.1687. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.
