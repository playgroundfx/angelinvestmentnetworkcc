USDCAD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 24.09.21 – 01.10.21Alex
Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 1.2894 with a target of 1.2478 – 1.2367.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
1.2894 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 1.3090 –
1.3250.

 **Analysis:** A descending correction appears to have formed as the
fourth wave 4 of larger degree on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) chart, with wave (С) of 4
completed inside. The fifth wave 5 started developing on the H4 chart,
with wave 1 of (1) of 5 formed and a descending correction developing as
wave 2 of (1) of 5 inside. On the H1 chart, apparently, wave a of 2
formed, wave b of 2 finished developing, and wave c of 2 is forming,
with the first wave of smaller degree (i) of c completed inside. If the
presumption is correct, then after the correction (ii) of c the pair
will continue to drop to the levels of 1.2478 – 1.2367. The level of
1.2894 is critical in this scenario as a breakout will enable the pair
to continue rising to the levels of 1.3090 – 1.3250.
