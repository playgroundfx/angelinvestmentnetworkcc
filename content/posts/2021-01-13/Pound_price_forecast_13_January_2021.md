Pound is betting. Forecast as of 13.01.2021Dmitri Demidenko

The resurgent US dollar and rumors about the interest-rate cut by the
Bank of England provoked a correction in GBPUSD. The pullback was short-
lived, and the pound is ready to restore the uptrend. What's next? Let
us discuss the Forex outlook and make up a [GBPUSD][1] trading plan

## Fundamental pound forecast for six months

Once the Brexit talk ended, the British pound returned to the game of
betting. Investors are closely following the economy and the Bank of
England representatives' comments discussing the possibility of the
interest-rate cut below zero. Dovish stance drove the [GBPUSD][1] price
down below 1.35. As soon as the hawks got down to business and the US
dollar weakened, the GBPUSD pair soared to the top of the 36th figure.

The chief of BoE Andrew Bailey says that even a successful Brexit would
cost the UK around £80bn, or about 4% of GDP in the long run, according
to an analysis by the Fiscal Responsibility Office. Along with the tense
epidemiological situation and the third lockdown in a row, this suggests
that the British economy will continue to recess. Such statements have
led money markets to believe that the Bank of England will lower the
interest rate below zero in August. Moreover, MPC member Silvana
Tenreyro said that the regulator was brainwashed, claiming that he could
not reduce rates to the negative area. It's not too late to do it now.

Nevertheless, as soon as Andrew Bailey said that such a [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) has
numerous drawbacks, and his deputy Ben Broadbent specified that negative
rates would damage bank margins, market expectations of the interest-
rate cut below zero shifted from August to December, and the pound
perked up. Broadbent noted that Britain's economy could be more robust
than macro statistics suggest. The current recession is unique. The GDP
growth is the weakest ever, and retail spending growth is almost the
strongest.

Thus, the MPC members' talks about monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) made GBPUSD pair
price fluctuate insanely, and its movements accelerated because of the
growing demand for the US dollar, with its subsequent extinction.
Greenback disappointed skeptics with a rally in US Treasury yields that
quickly faded after the auctions.

Indeed, the pound has accumulated many problems. The recession, the
threat of a Scottish independence referendum, and the fact that the
Brexit agreement mainly affects goods, while the colossal services
sector continues to experience difficulties due to uncertainty and
COVID-19. Nevertheless, a significant part of the political risks has
sunk into oblivion, trade weighted GBP index is below [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/)
averages. This, in turn, should support the pound in the context of the
dispersal of international trade after the victory over the pandemic.

### [GBPUSD][1] trading plan for six months

Let's not forget about the mid-term weakness of the US dollar. It is
caused due to the passiveness of the Fed, low Treasury yields, and
hatred of [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s for safe-haven assets amid expectations of further
improvement in global risk appetite. These circumstances allow me to
adhere to the [December forecast][2] for the growth of the [GBPUSD][1]
pair to the 1.4-1.42 area during the first half of the year. I would
suggest buying the pound.
