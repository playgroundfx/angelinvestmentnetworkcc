Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 13.01.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

The Bitcoin bullish trend could end at a level of 50000.00.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

The BTCUSD market continues forming the final impulse wave (5) of [5].
The price rose to high levels in the third wave of impulse (5); next, it
rolled down slightly in the zigzag-shaped correction 4. The corrective
wave 4 has most likely been completed, so the price should be rising in
the final sub-wave 5. The market could be rising to a level of 50000.00.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 32921.50 TP 50000.00

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

The hourly XRPUSD price chart displays the final leg of the bearish
correction B, which has a complex structure. The correction finished in
late December 2020; next, the market turned up and started rising. There
is now unfolding the initial leg of the bullish impulse. After the
impulse wave (1) finished, the price started declining, forming the
corrective wave (2) as a zigzag a-b-c. The impulse wave a and the
correction b look complete, so the price should be moving down in the c
impulse to a level of 0.200.

### Trading plan for **[XRPUSD][2]** today:

Sell 0.286, TP 0.200

* * *

## Elliott wave Ethereum analysis

After the upward impulse wave C finished, the price started declining in
the new downtrend. There must be forming the first impulse wave [A] of
the bearish regular zigzag [A]-[B]-[C]. The first four legs of the [A]
wave could have completed, so there should be developing impulse (5).
Impulse (5) could finish at a level of 784.00. When the [A] wave
completes, the market will start rising in the correction [B].

### Trading plan for  **[ETHUSD][3] **today:

Sell 1010.53, TP 784.00
