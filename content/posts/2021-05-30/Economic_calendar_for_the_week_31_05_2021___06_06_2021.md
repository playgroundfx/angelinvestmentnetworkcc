Economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the week 31.05.2021 – 06.06.2021Jana Kane

##  **Review of the main events of the Forex economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the
next trading week (31.05.2021 – 06.06.2021)**

 **Trading on key Forex [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/): next week we expect the publication of
important macro statistics from China, the US, Germany, Eurozone,
Switzerland, Canada, Australia, as well as the results of the meeting of
the Central Bank of Australia.**

The dollar was unable to develop an upward movement at the end of last
week and ended it at the same level as at the beginning.

Although short-term interest rates will remain near zero, positive
expectations for economic growth make it possible to start curtailing
the program of purchases of government bonds and mortgage bonds, said
Randal Quarles, a member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors and
its deputy head for banking supervision, catching dollar sellers by
surprise. Now the amount of their monthly purchases made by the Fed is
$120 billion. If the Fed really begins to curtail the quantitative
easing program, this could lead to an increase in the yield of US
government bonds, as well as to the strengthening of the dollar.

Nevertheless, optimism prevails on global stock exchanges, associated
with expectations of a further recovery in the global economy, both
against the backdrop of the ongoing vaccination against coronavirus in
Europe and North America, and the overly soft [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the world's
largest central banks. All three major American stock indices (S&P 500,
DJIA, NASDAQ100) finished last week with another gain.

So far, the trend of further weakening of the dollar continues.

Next week, financial market participants will pay attention to the
publication of important macro statistics from China, the US, Germany,
Eurozone, Switzerland, Canada, Australia, and the results of the meeting
of the central bank of Australia. But the key event will be the
publication of monthly data from the US labor market on Friday.

 **Traders should pay attention to the publication of the following
macro indicators:**

 ***during the coming week, new events may be added to the [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) and
/ or some scheduled events may be canceled**

 ****GMT time**

###  **Monday, May 31**

The US celebrates Memorial Day. Banks and stock exchanges will be
closed. Therefore, the trading volumes during the American trading
session will be small. Market participants trading the pound and UK
assets should also take into account that Monday is a bank holiday in
the UK.

###  **01:00 CNY Services PMI from the China Federation of Logistics &
Purchasing (CFLP)**

This indicator assesses the state of the service sector in the Chinese
economy. A result above 50 is considered positive and strengthens the
yuan. Previous values of the indicator: 56.3 in March, 51.4 in February,
52.4 in January. The indicator is above 50, which is likely to have a
positive effect on the yuan quotes, even with a slight relative decline.
If the indicator is below 50, the yuan will be under pressure and likely
to decline. Forecast for May: 52.7.

###  **01:00 CNY Manufacturing PMI from the China Federation of
Logistics & Purchasing (CFLP)**

This is an important indicator of the state of the Chinese economy as a
whole. A result above 50 is seen as positive and strengthens the CNY,
one below 50 as negative for the yuan. Previous values ​​of the
indicator: 51.9 in March, 50.6 in February, 51.3 in January.

The relative growth of the index and the value above 50 should have a
positive effect on the CNY. The data above the value of 50 indicates an
increase in activity, which has a positive effect on the quotes of the
national currency. In the opposite case, and if the indicator is below
50, the yuan will be under pressure and probably will decrease. Forecast
for May: 51.1.

###  **12:00 EUR Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) in Germany
(preliminary release)**

This index is published by the EU Statistical Office and is calculated
on the basis of a statistical method agreed between all EU countries. It
is an indicator for assessing inflation and is used by the Governing
Council of the ECB to assess the level of price stability. A positive
result strengthens the EUR, a negative one weakens it.

Preliminary forecast for May: +2.4% (against +2.1% in April, +2.0% in
March, +1.6% in January and February, -0.7% in December and negative
values ​​in the second half of 2020) in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/). If the data turn
out to be better than the forecast, the euro may strengthen in the short
term. The growth of the indicator is a positive factor for the euro. The
data suggests increasing inflationary pressures in Germany. The data
worse than the forecast and the previous value will negatively affect
the euro.

###  **Tuesday, June 1**

###  **04:30 AUD RBA's decision on interest rate. RBA's accompanying
statement**

In March 2020, the RBA made 2 rate cuts, bringing it to the level of
0.25%, and launched a quantitative easing program. At the same time, for
3-year government bonds of Australia, the target level of yield is set
at 0.25%. The RBA has launched a lending program for the banking system
in the amount of at least A$ 90 billion.

In early November 2020, the RB of Australia lowered its key rate again,
bringing it and its 3-year bond target to 0.10% from 0.25%, and
announced A$ 100 billion quantitative easing program to support the
economic recovery.

“We live in extraordinary and difficult times,” said central bank
governor Philip Lowe. In his opinion, "further stimulation is needed."
He stated this during a press conference on March 19, 2020, when the RBA
lowered the interest rate during its unscheduled meeting.

The main negative factors for the Australian economy are weak wages
growth, a weak labor market and a slowdown in growth. Annual inflation
has remained below the 2-3% target set by the RBA for four years.

Unemployment in the country has remained above the 5% level for many
years, unwilling to decline. Now the Australian economy is experiencing
difficulties due to the coronavirus pandemic, which has hit the tourism
and transport sectors hard.

It is expected that at this meeting the Central Bank of Australia will
leave the rate at the current level of 0.1%, although unexpected
decisions are not ruled out.

In an accompanying statement, the leaders of the RBA will explain the
reasons for the decision on the rate. If the RBA signals the possibility
of further easing of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) in the near future, the risks of a
fall in the Australian dollar will increase.

###  **07:00 CHF Switzerland GDP for Q1**

GDP is considered an indicator of the general state of a country's
economy and estimates the rate of its growth or decline. Gross Domestic
Product expresses in monetary [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) the aggregate value of all final
goods and services produced by Switzerland over a given period of time.
An upward trend in the GDP indicator is considered a positive factor for
the national currency (franc), while a low result is considered negative
(or bearish).

In the previous 4th quarter of 2020, GDP grew by +0.3% after growing by
+7.6% in the 3rd quarter, a decrease of -7.0% in the 2nd quarter and a
decrease of -1.7% in the 1st quarter of 2020. Switzerland's gross
domestic product and economy seem to be recovering after their fall in
the first half of 2020, although this decline is not comparable to the
decline in GDP in Germany, the Eurozone and the United States.
Switzerland's GDP is projected to contract by -0.5% in the 1st quarter
of 2021 (-0.2% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)). The data indicate a slowdown in the
recovery of the Swiss economy, which is a negative factor for the franc.

If the data turn out to be weaker than the forecast, the franc may
decline in the short term. However, one should not expect a strong fall
in the franc, since it is in active demand as a defensive asset. Better-
than-expected data may strengthen the franc in the short term.

###  **09:00 EUR Consumer Price Index in the Eurozone. Core CPI
(preliminary release)**

Consumer Price Index (CPI) is published by Eurostat and measures the
price change of a selected basket of goods and services over a given
period. The index is a key indicator for assessing inflation and changes
in purchasing habits. A positive result strengthens the EUR, a negative
one weakens it. At the end of 2020, the CPI index fell by -0.3%, which
indicates low inflationary pressures and even a slowdown in inflation.
Forecast for May: +1.9% (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) against +1.6% in April, +1.3%
in March, +0.9% in January and February. If the data turns out to be
worse than the forecast, the euro may fall sharply in the short term.
The data better than the forecast and / or the previous value may
strengthen the euro in the short-term, despite the low value (the target
level of the ECB's consumer inflation is just below 2.0%).

Core Consumer Price Index (Core CPI) determines the change in prices of
a selected basket of goods and services for a given period and is a key
indicator for assessing inflation and changes in consumer preferences.
Food and energy have been excluded from this indicator to provide a more
accurate estimate. A high result strengthens the EUR, while a low result
weakens it. In January 2021, the core CPI rose by +1.4%, by +1.1% in
February (on an annualized basis) after more modest values ​​of +0.2%
between September and December 2020. If the data turn out to be worse
than the previous value or forecast, this may negatively affect the
euro. If the data turn out to be better than the forecast or the
previous value, the euro is likely to react with an increase in
quotations, but only in the short term. Inflation in the Eurozone
remains low, which is a negative factor for the euro. Forecast for May:
+0.9%.

###  **10:00** OPEC meeting

At this meeting, OPEC together with other major oil-producing countries
must decide on production volumes for the next time period. If a
decision is made to limit / reduce production volumes, this will have a
positive effect on oil prices. The opposite decision will cause,
accordingly, a negative impact on oil prices. The parameters of the new
agreement on production volumes will also matter.

###  **12:30 CAD Canada GDP. Annual data on Canada GDP**

Canada's GDP report is published by Statistics Canada. A strong report
will strengthen the CAD. A weak GDP report will negatively affect the
CAD. The previous report pointed to the growth of GDP in Canada (in
February) by +0.4%.

Canada's Quarterly GDP report reflects the total volume of all goods and
services produced by Canada for the quarter (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) and is
considered an indicator of the general health of the Canadian economy.
In the previous 4th quarter of 2020, GDP grew by 9.6% (after growing by
40.6% in the 3rd quarter and falling by -38.1% in the 2nd quarter of
2020). If the data for the 1st quarter of 2021 turns out to be stronger
than the previous value, the CAD will strengthen.

Forecast: +1.0% in March and +7.0% in the 1st quarter. This is positive
data for the CAD, despite its relative decline (in quarterly [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)).

###  **14:00 USD US Manufacturing PMI from ISM**

Published by the Institute for Supply Management (ISM), the US
Manufacturing PMI is an important indicator of the health of the US
economy as a whole. A result above 50 is seen as positive and
strengthens the USD, one below 50 as negative for the US dollar.
Forecast: 61.0 in May (against 60.7 in April, 64.7 in March, 60.8 in
February, 58.7 in January, 60.7 in December). The index is above the 50
level and has a relatively high value, which is likely to support the
dollar. Data above 50 indicates an acceleration of activity, which has a
positive effect on the quotes of the national currency. If the indicator
drops below the forecast and especially below the value of 50, the
dollar may sharply weaken in the short term.

###  **15:00 GBP Speech by the head of the Bank of England Andrew
Bailey**

Financial market participants expect Andrew Bailey to clarify the
situation regarding the future [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the UK central bank. Volatility
during the speech of the head of the Bank of England usually rises
sharply in the quotes of the pound and the London Stock Exchange FTSE
index, if he gives any hints of tightening or easing of the Bank of
England's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). Probably, Andrew Bailey will also give
explanations regarding the earlier decision by the Bank of England on
the interest rate and will touch upon the state and prospects of the
British economy after Brexit and the phased lifting of quarantine
restrictions due to the coronavirus. If Bailey does not touch on
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) issues, the reaction to his speech will be weak.

###  **Wednesday, June 2**

###  **01:30 AUD Australia GDP (Q1)**

Australian Bureau of Statistics report on the country's GDP, which is
the main indicator of the state of the Australian economy, for the 1st
quarter. A strong report will strengthen the AUD. A weak GDP report will
negatively affect the AUD. Forecast: +2.5% (against +3.1% in Q4, +3.3%
in Q3, -7.0% in Q2, -0.3% in Q1 m quarter of 2020). The growth of the
indicator is a positive factor for the AUD, the decline is negative. If
the data turns out to be worse than the forecast, the AUD may decline
sharply.

###  **06:00 EUR Retail sales in Germany**

Retail sales is the main indicator of consumer spending in Germany
showing changes in retail sales. A high result strengthens the euro, and
vice versa, a low result weakens it. Forecast: -2.0% (-0.3% yoy) in
April against +7.7% (+11% yoy) in March, +1.2% (-9.0% yoy) ) in
February, -4.5% (-8.7% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) in January, -9.6% (+1.5% in
annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) in December, +1.9% (+5.6 % in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) in November.

The data indicate the instability of the recovery of this sector of the
German economy, including due to lockdowns due to the coronavirus. The
data release is unlikely to have a positive impact on the euro. Better-
than-expected data is likely to have a positive effect on the euro, but
in the short term.

###  **Thursday, June 3**

###  **01:30 AUD Balance of trade. Retail Sales Index**

The indicator (trade balance) assesses the ratio of Australia's exports
and imports. Growth in exports from Australia leads to an increase in
the trade surplus, which has a positive impact on the AUD. Previous
value A$ 5.574 billion (March), A$ 7.529 billion (February). A decrease
in the trade surplus may negatively affect the Australian dollar.
Conversely, the growing trade surplus is a positive factor for the AUD.
Forecast for April: A$ 8,000 billion.

The Retail Sales Index is published monthly by the Australian Bureau of
Statistics and measures total retail sales. The index is often
considered an indicator of consumer confidence and reflects the health
of the retail sector in the near term. A rise in the index is usually
positive for the AUD; a decrease in the indicator will negatively affect
the AUD. Previous index value (for March) +1.1%. If the data turns out
to be weaker than the previous value, the AUD may sharply decline in the
short term, but if it's above the previous values, the AUD is likely to
strengthen.

###  **12:15 USD ADP National Employment Report**

Typically, the ADP's private sector employment report has a strong
impact on the market and dollar quotes. An increase in the value of this
indicator has a positive effect on the dollar. The growth in the number
of workers in the US private sector in May is expected to be +545,000
(against an increase of 742,000 in April, 517,000 in March, 117,000 in
February, 174,000 in January, a fall of -123,000 in December). The
relative growth of the indicator may have a positive effect on the
dollar quotes, while the relative decline in the indicator - a negative
effect. Therefore, the market reaction may be negative, and the dollar
may decline if the data turns out to be worse than the forecast and / or
the previous value.

Millions of Americans have previously been laid off due to the
coronavirus pandemic and related quarantine measures. The bulk of
layoffs were concentrated in tourism and retail. Other important sectors
of the economy were also affected. ADP previously reported that the most
significant drop in employment was recently noted in the construction
and financial services sectors.

Although the ADP report does not directly correlate with the official US
Department of Labor data on the labor market, which will be released on
Friday, the ADP report is often a harbinger of it, having a noticeable
impact on the market.

###  **14:00 USD US Services PMI from** **ISM**

This indicator assesses the state of the service sector in the US
economy. These service sectors (as opposed to the manufacturing sector)
have practically no impact on the country's GDP.

In April this indicator came out with a value of 62.7, and in March
63.7. A result above 50 is seen as positive for the USD. However, a
relative decline in the index could negatively affect the dollar in the
short term. Forecast for May: 62.9, which is likely to have a positive
overall effect on the USD.

###  **GBP Hearing of the inflation report (scheduled after 15:30)**

The Governor of the Bank of England and members of the Monetary Policy
Committee of the Bank of England will speak in parliament with comments
on the current economic situation and the outlook for the economy. At
this time, the volatility in trading of the pound may rise sharply.
Apart from GDP, one of the main benchmarks for the Bank of England
regarding the prospects for monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) in the UK is the inflation
rate. If the tone of the report is soft, then the British stock market
will receive support and the pound will decline. Conversely, tough
rhetoric of the Bank of England representatives regarding inflation
control, implying an increase in the interest rate in the UK, will lead
to the strengthening of the pound.

###  **16:00 GBP Speech by the Governor of the Bank of England Andrew
Bailey**

Volatility during the speech of the head of the Bank of England usually
rises sharply in the quotes of the pound and the London Stock Exchange
FTSE index, if he gives any hints of tightening or easing of the Bank of
England's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). Probably, Andrew Bailey will also give
explanations regarding the earlier decision by the Bank of England on
the interest rate and will touch upon the state and prospects of the
British economy after Brexit and the phased lifting of quarantine
restrictions due to the coronavirus. If Bailey does not touch on
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) issues, the reaction to his speech will be weak.

###  **Friday, June 4**

###  **09:00** **EUR Retail Sales in Europe**

Retail sales is a major consumer spending indicator that shows the
change in retail sales. A high result strengthens the euro, and vice
versa, a low result weakens it. Forecast for April: +9.6% (YoY) against
+2.7% and +12% (YoY) in March, +3.0% and -2.9% (YoY) in February -5.9%
and -6.4% (annualized) in January. The data suggests that, despite the
rise in indices, retail sales have not yet reached pre-coronavirus
levels after a sharp drop in March-April 2020, when strict quarantine
measures were in force in Europe. Thus, the publication of the data with
the indicated values ​​is unlikely to provide the euro with significant
support if they do not turn out to be better than the forecast.

###  **12:30 USD Average hourly wages. Non-farm payrolls. Unemployment
rate**

The most important indicators of the state of the labor market in the
United States in May. Forecast: +0.2% (against +0.7% in April, -0.1% in
March, +0.2% in January and February, +0.8% in December, +0.3% in
November ) / +0.621 million (against +0.266 million in April, +0.916
million in March, +0.379 in February, +0.049 million in January, -0.140
million in December, +0.245 million in November, +0.638 million in
October, +1.763 million in July and -20.687 million in April 2020) /
5.9% (against 6.1% in April, 6.0% in March, 6.2% in February, 6.3% in
January, 6.7 % in December and November, 6.9% in October, 13.3% in May
and 14.7% in April 2020), respectively.

In general, the indicators can be described as encouraging. The data
speaks of continued improvement in the US labor market after plummeting
in the first half of 2020. Prior to the coronavirus, the US labor market
remained strong, signaling the stability of the American economy and
supporting dollar quotes.

It is often difficult to predict the market reaction to the publication
of indicators, because many indicators for previous periods are subject
to revision. Now it will be even more difficult to do this, because the
economic situation in the United States and many other large economies
remains controversial due to the coronavirus. In any case, when data
from the US labor market are published, a surge in volatility is
expected in trading not only in USD, but throughout the entire financial
market. Probably the most cautious [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s would prefer to stay out of
the market during this timeframe.

###  **12:30** **CAD Unemployment rate in Canada**

Statistics Canada is to publish data on the country's labor market for
May.

Unemployment has risen in Canada in recent months, including amid
massive business closures due to coronavirus and layoffs. Unemployment
rose from the usual 5.6% - 5.7% to 7.8% in March and already up to 13.7%
in May 2020. If unemployment continues to rise, the Canadian dollar will
decline. If the data turn out to be better than the previous value, the
Canadian dollar will strengthen. A decrease in the unemployment rate is
a positive factor for the CAD, an increase in unemployment is a negative
factor. Unemployment is expected to be 7.8% in May (against 8.1% in
April, 7.5% in March, 8.2% in February, 9.4% in January, 8.8% in
December, 8.6% in November).
