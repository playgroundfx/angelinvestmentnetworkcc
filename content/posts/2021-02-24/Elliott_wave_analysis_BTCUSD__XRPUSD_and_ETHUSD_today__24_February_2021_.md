Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 24.02.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

Bitcoin and Ethereum should be forming bearish double zigzags over the
next few days.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

The BTCUSD market is forming an uptrend as an impulse. The [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) chart
displays the middle leg of this impulse, wave 3, which looks complete.
The price is now declining in corrective wave 4, which could end as a
double zigzag [W]-[X]-[Y]. The sub-wave [W] has finished, so the market
should be soon rising in the linking wave [X] to a level of 54950.00. It
is relevant to enter long positions in the current situation.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 50271.50, TP 54950.00

* * *

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

After the upward linking wave (X) finished, the Ripple market has
started a new corrective pattern. There is forming a bearish zigzag,
where impulse [A] and a long correction [B] have finished. Wave [B] is a
triple zigzag (w)-(x)-(y)-(xx)-(z). The market is now declining in an
impulse. The sub-waves (1)-(2)-(3) have been formed, and a short
corrective wave (4) should soon end, followed by impulse 5. The target
for sell trades will be the previous low at 0.333, made by wave [A].

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] today:

Sell 0.491, TP 0.333

* * *

## Elliott wave Ethereum analysis

The ETHUSD market situation is similar to the Bitcoin. The large impulse
wave C ended. Next, the market has started declining in a corrective
wave, which is likely to complete as a double zigzag [W]-[X]-[Y]. The
first part of this double zigzag, sub-wave [W], has finished. Therefore,
the Ethereum price should be rising in the linking wave [X] to the
previous high made by the (b) correction, level 1970.00.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Buy 1622.60, TP 1970.00
