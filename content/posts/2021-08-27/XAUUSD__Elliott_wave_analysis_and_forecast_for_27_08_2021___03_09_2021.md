XAUUSD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 27.08.2021 –
03.09.2021Alex Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 1833.26 with a target of 1650.00 – 1602.20.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
1833.26 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 1915.00
– 1960.23.

 **Analysis:** an ascending third wave of larger degree (3) formed and a
descending correction continues developing as the fourth wave (4) on the
[daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) chart. Wave В of (4) appears to have formed on the H4 chart, and
wave C of (4) is now developing. The third wave of smaller degree iii of
C is formed on the H1 chart, and a local correction developed as wave iv
of C, supposedly. If this assumption is correct, the pair will continue
falling to 1650.00 – 1602.20 in wave v of C. The level of 1833.26 is
critical in this scenario as a breakout will enable the pair to continue
growing to the levels of 1915.00 – 1960.23.
