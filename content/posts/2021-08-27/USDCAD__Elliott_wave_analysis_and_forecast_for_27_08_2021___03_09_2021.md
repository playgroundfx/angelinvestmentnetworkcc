USDCAD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 27.08.2021 –
03.09.2021Alex Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions from corrections above the
level of 1.2573 with a target of 1.3090 – 1.3413.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
1.2573 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of 1.2417
– 1.2247.

 **Analysis:** A descending correction appears to have formed as the
fourth wave 4 of larger degree on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) chart, with wave (С) of 4
completed inside. The fifth wave 5 has started forming on the H4 chart,
with wave 1 of (1) of 5 forming inside. Apparently, the third wave of
smaller degree (iii) of v of 1 formed and a local correction finished
developing in the form of wave (iv) of v of 1 on the H1 chart. If the
presumption is correct, the pair will continue to rise in wave (v) of v
of 1 to the levels of 1.3090 – 1.3413. The level of 1.2573 is critical
in this scenario as its breakout will enable the pair to continue
declining to the levels of 1.2417 – 1.2247.
