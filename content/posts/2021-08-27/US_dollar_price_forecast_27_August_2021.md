Cowardice does not suit Dollar. Forecast as of 27.08.2021Dmitri
Demidenko

I don’t think the Fed will follow the example of the Reserve Bank of New
Zealand, which canceled the cash rate hike due to the Delta. The US
economy has adapted to COVID-19, is it worth changing the plans because
of the pandemic? Let us discuss the Forex outlook and make up a
[EURUSD][1] trading plan.

## Weekly US dollar fundamental forecast

Monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) is not a one-man show. Even if Jerome Powell in Jackson
Hole starts to panic about the Delta, which I highly doubt, it is not
certain that the rest of the FOMC will be doves. Ahead of an important
meeting of bankers, the Fed’s officials unanimously said that their
business [contact](https://www.playgroundfx.com/contact/)s claim that the new strain of COVID-19 has little
impact on business. If so, is it worth giving up the Fed’s plans because
of the pandemic?

According to the President of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis
James Bullard, at the moment the US economy does not need asset
purchases from the central bank. The Fed is doing more harm than help by
continuing to buy mortgage bonds, fueling the housing market bubble. The
President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City Esther George noted
that the economy is experiencing the current surge of COVID-19 as well
as the previous ones, the pandemic has an insignificant impact on
business. Furthermore, strong inflation and the labor market recovery
suggest the QE should be scaled back. It is better if this process
starts sooner than later.

Even Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan, who dropped the US dollar by
commenting on the Delta's relation with monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), seems to be
hawkish. Kaplan says the federal funds rate could be raised next year.

The Fed’s hawkish tone encouraged the derivatives market to raise the
chance of the first interest rate hike in December 2022 from 66% to 69%,
in November - from 47% to 49%.

While the Fed is willing to start normalizing its monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), there
is a dispute among the ECB governors. Judging by the minutes of the July
meeting of the Governing Council, the ECB officials are focused on the
strategy of tolerance for inflation, which allows exceeding the 2%
inflation target. The comment that the asset purchase will be completed
shortly before the regulator hikes rates irritated the hawks. The ECB
hawks suggest such wording implies a long-term process of implementing
the asset purchase program, which would be harmful to the economy.

Therefore, the Fed is about to start tightening its monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/),
while the ECB doesn’t even discuss such a possibility. Divergence in the
monetary policies will continue setting back the [EURUSD][1] bulls.
Furthermore, the US economy should be outperforming the euro-area one,
which is evident from the willingness of Congress to approve of the new
stimulus package for $4.5 trillion offered by Joe Biden.

### Weekly[ EURUSD][1] trading plan

Markets do not expect any surprises from Jerome Powell. The consensus
forecast suggests the Fed Chair will announce the tapering of the QE in
November and start the actual process in December or January. The Delta
will hardly make the Fed cancel its plans. The Reserve Bank of New
Zealand seems to be in trouble acting like a coward concerning the cash
rate. I don’t think the Fed President, whose term expires in February,
will make the same mistake. Therefore, it is still relevant to sell the
[EURUSD][1] on the rebound from the resistance zone of 1.18-1.1815 or
the breakout of the support at 1.1725.
