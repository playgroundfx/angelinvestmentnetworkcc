USDJPY: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 27.08.2021 –
03.09.2021Alex Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions from corrections above the
level of 109.08 with a target of 113.50 – 115.00.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
109.08 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of 107.16
– 106.07.

 **Analysis:** Daily chart: apparently, a descending correction of
larger degree finished forming as wave B, and wave С started developing,
with the first wave (1) of С forming inside.

The third wave of smaller degree 3 of (1) continues developing on the H4
chart, with wave i of 3 formed and a downside correction completed as
wave ii of 3 inside. Apparently, the third wave iii of 3 is developing
on the H1 chart, with wave (iii) of iii forming inside. If the
presumption is correct, the pair will continue to rise to the levels of
113.50 – 115.00. The level of 109.08 is critical in this scenario as a
breakout will enable the pair to continue declining to the levels of
107.16 – 106.07.
