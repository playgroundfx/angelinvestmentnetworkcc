Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 27.08.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

The cryptocurrency pairs should continue rising in the final sub-waves,
concluding bullish trends.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

The most recent chart section displays the final, fifth subwave of thew
(C) wave of a larger degree. Wave 5 is composed of sub-waves
[1]-[2]-[3]-[4]-[5], where the first four parts have completed, and the
final wave [5] is still developing. Four waves of a smaller degree
(1)-(2)-(3)-(4) have finished within wave [5]. The Bitcoin price should
be rising in the subwave (5) to a level of 51900.00. It is relevant to
buy.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 46874.50, TP 51900.00

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

The most recent section of the XRPUSD price chart displays the final,
fifth, wave, concluding the bullish impulse. In wave [5], there has
completed corrective wave (4) as a double zigzag W-X-Y, whose waves seem
to be triple zigzags. The Ripple price should be rising in wave (5) to a
level of 1.402. One could enter buy trades under the current conditions.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] **** today:

Buy 1.071, TP 1.402

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

The ETHUSD market is forming the final leg of the impulse up wave [C],
wave (5). Wave (5) should be unfolding as a regular five-wave impulse
1-2-3-4-5. The corrective down wave 4 must have completed as a simple
zigzag [A]-[B]-[C]. The Ethereum price should be rising to a level of
3670.00. One could enter purchases in the current situation.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:
