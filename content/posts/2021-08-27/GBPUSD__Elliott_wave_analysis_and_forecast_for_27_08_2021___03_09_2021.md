GBPUSD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 27.08.2021 –
03.09.2021Alex Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 1.3830 with a target of 1.3400 – 1.3157.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
1.3830 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 1.3982 –
1.4243.

 **Analysis:** the first wave of larger degree (1) formed on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/)
chart, and a downside correction continues forming as wave (2). Wave B
of (2) appears to have finished developing on the H4 chart. Wave С of
(2) is forming at the moment, with the third wave of smaller degree iii
of C unfolding as part of it. Apparently, wave (iii) of iii developed on
the H1 chart, and a local correction formed as wave (iv) of iii. If the
presumption is correct, the pair will continue to drop to the levels of
1.3400 – 1.3157. The level of 1.3830 is critical in this scenario as a
breakout will enable the pair to continue rising to the levels of 1.3982
– 1.4243.
