Economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the week 05.10.2020 – 11.10.2020Jana Kane

##  **Review of the main events of the Forex economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the
next trading week (05.10.2020 – 11.10.2020)**

 **Trading on key Forex [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/): next week we expect the publication of
important macro statistics from the Eurozone, the US, Australia, Canada,
as well as the results of the RBA meeting.**

Financial market participants were rather restrained in their reaction
to the publication of data from the American labor market last Friday.
The Labor Department reported growth in non-farm payrolls by 661,000 in
the US in September, with an unemployment rate of 7.9%. The economy has
recovered just over half of the jobs lost since the start of the
coronavirus pandemic. At the same time, the American consumer sentiment
continued to rise. The University of Michigan reported last Friday that
consumer sentiment rose to 80.4 in September against the forecast of
79.0, preliminary estimate of 78.9 and the August value of 74.1.

Meanwhile, pressure on stock indices intensified after [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) that US
President Donald Trump had contracted coronavirus. Observers say the
[news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) is adding uncertainty to Trump's campaign and the outcome of the
election. Economists believe that under Biden, stronger fiscal stimulus
measures can be expected, which will be highly relevant to economic
recovery in the near term, while under Trump, the prospect of a long
period of extremely low interest rates is more likely. This will support
business activity over a longer period of time, and this is extremely
important for buyers of high-yield and risky stock assets, betting on
the further growth of the American stock market.

One way or another, the dollar closed last week in negative territory,
while US stock indices rose, which nevertheless speaks of maintaining
positive [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) sentiment.

The focus of [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s next week will be on the publication of important
macro data on the Eurozone, the US, Australia, Canada, as well as the
RBA meeting. October 1 to October 7, China celebrates the national
holiday - the National Day of the People's Republic of China; banks and
stock exchanges of the country will be closed.

 **Traders should pay attention to the publication of the following
macro indicators:**

 ***during the coming week, new events may be added to the [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) and
/ or some scheduled events may be canceled**

 ****** **GMT time**

###  **Monday, October 5**

###  **09:00 EUR Retail sales in the Eurozone**

Retail sales is the main consumer spending indicator that shows the
change in retail sales. A high result strengthens the euro, and vice
versa, a low result weakens it. August forecast: +0.9% and +0.6% (YoY)
against +1.3% (+0.4% yoy) in July. It is difficult to predict the euro's
reaction to the publication of these values, since data suggests that
while retail sales rose in August, it has yet to reach pre-coronavirus
levels after falling sharply in March-April, when Europe was under tight
quarantine measures.

###  **14:00 USD ISM Services PMI**

This indicator assesses the state of the services sector in the US
economy. These services sectors (in contrast to the manufacturing
sector) have practically no impact on the country's GDP.

In August, this indicator came out with a value of 56.9. A result above
50 is seen as positive for the USD. However, a relative decline in the
index could negatively affect the dollar in the short term. Outlook for
September: 56.0, which is likely to have a positive overall effect on
the USD.

###  **Tuesday, October 6**

###  **00:30 AUD Balance of trade**

This indicator measures the relationship between Australia's export and
import volumes. Growth in exports from Australia leads to an increase in
the trade surplus, which has a positive impact on the AUD. Previous
value (August): AU$ 4.294 billion. A decrease in the trade surplus may
negatively affect the Australian dollar.

###  **03:30 AUD Interest rate decision. The RBA's accompanying
statement**

In March, the RBA made 2 rate cuts, bringing it to the current level of
0.25%, and launched a quantitative easing program. At the same time, for
3-year government bonds of Australia, the target level of yield is set
at 0.25%. The RBA has launched a program to lend to the banking system
in the amount of at least A$90 billion and intends to buy bonds for A$5
billion.

The negative forecasts of economists suggest that the Australian economy
will contract by 6% in 2020, which will be the sharpest annual GDP
contraction since the Great Depression of the 1920s. The unemployment
rate is likely to rise to around 8.5%.

Some economists have talked about Australia entering its first recession
in nearly 30 years, which could turn into a depression.

“We live in extraordinary and difficult times,” said central bank
governor Philip Lowe. In his opinion, "further stimulation is needed."
He stated this during a press conference on March 19, when the RBA
lowered the interest rate during its unscheduled meeting.

Philip Lowe has repeatedly stated that the central bank is ready to cut
the rate again if necessary, although the likelihood of introducing
negative rates, in his opinion, is "extremely small."

The main negative factors for the Australian economy are weak wages
growth, a weak labor market and a slowdown in growth. Annual inflation
has remained below the 2-3% target set by the RBA for almost four years.

Unemployment in the country remains above the 5% level for many years,
unwilling to decline. Now the coronavirus pandemic has been added to the
aforementioned negative factors, which has hurt the tourism and
transport sectors. The RBA also expresses concerns that unemployment may
rise to 8%, or even 10%.

In this regard, one cannot eliminate the possibility that on Tuesday,
October 6, the RBA may again cut the rate, although most economists
believe that the bank will leave the key rate unchanged at this meeting,
at 0.25%, while expressing concerns about the outlook for the global
economy due to the ongoing coronavirus epidemic.

In an accompanying statement, the RBA executives will explain the
reasons for the rate decision. If the RBA signals the possibility of
further easing of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) in the near future, the risks of a
fall in the Australian dollar will increase.

###  **(Time of publication unknown) AUD Publication of budget plan**

During the Asian trading session, the Australian government will publish
an annual budget plan, which is likely to cause more volatility in the
Australian dollar. However, it should be borne in mind that the exact
time of publication is unknown.

###  **14:40 USD Speech by the Fed Chairman Jerome Powell**

Powell's comments could affect both short-term and long-term USD trading
if he again touches on the Fed's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). A more hawkish stance
on the Fed's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) is seen as positive and strengthens the US
dollar, while a more cautious position is seen as negative for the USD.

If he makes unexpected statements, the volatility in trading in the
financial markets may increase.

"I think the 'new norm' now is lower interest rates, lower inflation,
and possibly weaker economic growth," Powell said earlier, adding that
"very, very low and even negative rates that observed in the countries
of the world, unacceptable for our economy. " Despite calls by US
President Donald Trump for zero or even negative interest rates, the Fed
leaders are trying to resist pressure from the president. Financial
market participants will carefully study his speech in order to catch
signals regarding the further actions of the Fed.

###  **Wednesday, October 7**

###  **12:10 EUR Speech by President of the ECB Christine Lagarde**

The market usually reacts strongly to the speeches of the head of the
ECB, which follow immediately after the ECB's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) meeting.
At least this was the case under Mario Draghi. Other speeches by Mario
Draghi elicited less market reaction.

During her first press conference as President of the ECB, Christine
Lagarde noted that there are initial signs of stabilization of the
European economy and acceleration of core inflation.

Earlier in September, Lagarde announced concerns about the side effects
of providing cheap financing and signaled that the ECB would undertake a
lengthy overhaul of its strategy and toolbox. The revision is expected
to take several months. It could lead to a change in the inflation
target, which is now just below 2%, or impose restrictions on the use of
negative rates or large-scale purchases of bonds.

"(ECB's) goal to complete it by the end of 2020". If Christine Lagarde
makes unexpected statements regarding the recent ECB meeting and the
bank's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), it will again trigger a surge in volatility in
the euro and European stock indices.

###  **18:00 USD Minutes of the meeting of the Federal Open Market
Committee**

The publication of the minutes is extremely important for determining
the course of the current Fed [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) and the prospects for raising
interest rates in the United States. The volatility of trading in
financial markets during the publication of the minutes usually
increases, since the text of the minutes often contains either changes
or clarifying details regarding the results of the last FOMC meeting.

Recently, more and more statements from the Fed leaders have been
indicating the Fed's inclination to continue its [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of supporting
the American economy, which has been badly hit by the coronavirus.

Following its regular meeting in September, the Fed left interest rates
unchanged and reaffirmed its intention to support the American economy
amid the coronavirus pandemic. The US Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome
Powell also reiterated that the central bank will use all of its tools
for "as long as necessary" to ensure the strongest possible economic
recovery and limit long-term economic damage. The Fed chairman noted the
extremely uncertain economic outlook for the United States, expressing
concern that the increase in the number of cases of coronavirus is
negatively affecting business activity in the country.

The soft tone of the minutes will have a positive effect on stock
indices and negatively on the US dollar. The tough rhetoric of the Fed
leaders regarding the prospects for monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) will push the dollar
to further growth.

###  **Thursday, October 8**

###  **09:30 CHF Speech by chairman of the SNB Thomas Jordan**

Volatility of CHF trading increases during speeches by the SNB Chairman
Thomas Jordan, and traders are waiting for signals regarding further
plans of the SNB's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). The central bank of Switzerland has
consistently advocated a soft monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) in the country, and
traditionally considers the rate of the national currency "overvalued".
Jordan's tough rhetoric will strengthen the franc. The soft tone of the
speech and the intention to continue the extra soft monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of
the SNB will negatively affect the franc.

###  **12:30 CAD Speech by the Governor of the Bank of Canada Tiff
Macklem**

Tiff Macklem succeeded Stephen Poloz as Governor of the Bank of Canada
on June 3, 2020. Macklem faces essentially the same tasks as his
predecessor on this post.

The Canadian economy, as well as the entire global economy, is showing
signs of a slowdown, which is due to the downturn in business activity
due to the coronavirus pandemic. Earlier this year, Stephen Poloz said
that the Canadian economy is robust enough to keep rates unchanged
despite the worsening global economy. However, the situation is changing
rapidly and not for the better. It will be interesting now to learn
McLeam's opinion on the sustainability of the Canadian economy and the
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the central bank.

If Tiff Macklem touches on the topic of the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the Bank
of Canada, the volatility in the quotes of the Canadian dollar will rise
sharply. His tough tone will help strengthen the Canadian dollar. The
soft rhetoric of Macklem's speech and the intention to pursue soft
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) will negatively affect the CAD quotes.

Probably, it can also provide some guidelines for [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s ahead of the
next meeting of the Bank of Canada, which will be held at the end of
this month (October 28).

###  **Friday, October 9**

###  **12:30 CAD Unemployment rate in Canada**

Statistics Canada is to publish data on the country's labor market for
September.

Unemployment has risen in Canada in recent months amid massive business
closings due to coronavirus and layoffs. Unemployment rose from the
usual 5.6% - 5.7% to 7.8% in March and to 13.7% in May. If unemployment
continues to rise, the Canadian dollar will decline. If the data is
better than the previous value, the Canadian dollar will strengthen. A
decrease in the unemployment rate is a positive factor for the CAD, an
increase in unemployment is a negative factor. Unemployment is expected
to be at 10.1% in September (after 10.2%, 10.9%, 12.3%, 13.7%, 13.0% in
previous months).
