Gold bulls will step back. Forecast as of 05.11.2020Dmitri Demidenko

Is the gold trend clear? Will the medium-term consolidation in the range
of $1860-$1970 per ounce become a long-term one? Let us discuss gold
prospects and make up a [XAUUSD][1] trading plan.

## Weekly fundamental forecast for gold

Gold, like most assets, lively reacted to the US presidential election.
It first dropped amid the growing chance of Donald Trump’s victory;
next, it resumed rising after the [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) about Biden’s likely victory.
Gold follows Treasuries and greenback, so its short-term outlook is
quite clear. Another matter is a more distant future.

The worst drop of Treasury yields over the past seven years has
triggered the [XAUUSD][1] rally. If Biden could still become the
President, the Democrats will hardly take the majority in the Senate. If
so, the US government will hardly provide a massive fiscal stimulus.
They will issue fewer bonds than it was earlier expected. Does it make
sense to sell Treasuries in the secondary market?

Besides, the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) death rate of COVID-19 hits a record high; the number
of infected people exceeded 600 thousand per day for the first time
since the pandemic had started. Furthermore, some euro-area economies
are locked down, the US economy has slowed down in the fourth quarter.
Therefore, the Treasuries should continue falling. Nonetheless, the
yield is at a level higher than that in summer, 0.6%, which signals that
markets still expect a stimulus. Remember, gold can’t win over the
income-generating assets, so the drop in Treasury yields is a bullish
factor for the [XAUUSD][1].

Gold should also benefit from a weaker dollar. The dollar is rising amid
Trump’s success, and the chances for Trump’s reelection are going down.
So, the USD is also going down. In fact, traders are working out the
idea of the widening of the US twin deficit in the case of Joe Biden’s
victory. Is there any use in trading based on a single idea? One had
better focus on such factors as the leading pace of the US GDP compared
to the euro-area growth, pressed down by lockdowns, and the continuing
political uncertainty resulted from Trump’s willingness to reject the
election results.

If the greenback starts rising, the gold rally will stop. Will the Fed’s
pricing affect it? I don’t think the FOMC member would take active
measures at the October meeting, as the voting results are still
unknown. The Fed is likely to stick to its wait-and-see approach, going
on with its vague speeches about the necessity of the fiscal stimulus
and the US central bank’s willingness to take active steps if needed.

The uncertainty around the US presidential elections undermines the
importance of not only the Fed’s meeting but also of the US jobs report.
On the other hand, if it will be known who has won the elections by the
time of the release of the US employment data, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s will consider
the factor of the downturn in the US employment.

### Weekly gold trading plan

Therefore, the greenback could soon start growing. If so, it should be
relevant to enter short-term gold sell trades on the price rebound from
the resistances at $1930-$1935 and $1965-$1970.
