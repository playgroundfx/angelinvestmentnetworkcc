Dollar loses confidence. Forecast for 05.11.2020Dmitri Demidenko

Markets rush from the Democrat to the Republican and vice versa, but
political uncertainty is likely to persist. Trump has appealed to the
Supreme Court for a recount of votes. How will this affect [EURUSD][1]?
Let's discuss it and make a trading plan.

## Weekly US dollar fundamental forecast

Who will have the last laugh? Some [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s ridiculed the sociologists
who predicted Joe Biden's victory on November 3, but a day later they
had to shut up: the Democrat's chances increased significantly, which
led to the fall of the US dollar, while the Chinese yuan, Australian
dollar and Mexican peso all skyrocketed... However, the final results
have not yet been calculated, the risks of recounts are growing, so it's
too early to laugh.

Markets often make mistakes in politics, but it is rare to see them
assess the likelihood of all three presidential outcomes - a Republican
victory, a Democrat victory, and a long recount with the Supreme Court
involvement. Don't be surprised at the insane movement of assets: the
market has changed its assumptions as to who will win several times. The
US dollar has rolled on a roller coaster, while the main driver behind
the [S&P 500][2] rally was, at first, technology companies, and then
securities of the industrial and consumer sectors.

The fall in Treasury yields is attributed to diminished chances of a
massive fiscal stimulus. So far, the most likely scenario is Biden's
winning the seat at the White House, Democrats winning the House of
Representatives, though with fewer seats than before, Republicans
winning the Senate. If this is the case, then it will be hard to push
through the proposed tax increases and increased tax [regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/). The
risks of radical reforms are decreasing, which cannot but please the
market.

### US Early Election Results

What's next? There are serious concerns that the [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) of the 2000
election dispute will repeat itself when the [S&P 500][2] fell by 4%
between the date of the election and the Supreme Court ruling in mid-
December. This time, the losses in the stock index may be more
significant, because, according to Monex Europe, current US politics is
more polarized.

It should also be noticed that the market cannot be fed only politics
for a long time. The fastest growth in business activity in the services
sector of the US economy in October since April 2015, according to
research by Markit, contrasts with the eurozone, which is on the verge
of recession, and the composite PMI of which is stuck at around 50 due
to problems in the non-manufacturing sector. Divergence in the economic
growth of the Eurozone and the United States signals that one has to
start shorting [EURUSD][1].

The monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) indicates the same thing. The Fed does not even
think about raising the rates and the maximum it might do at its meeting
on November 5 is to change the structure of assets within the QE by $120
billion per month. The ECB is ready to go much further. According to
Isabel Schnabel, a member of the Executive Board of the ECB, the
eurozone's economy needs additional stimulus amid the second wave of
COVID-19.

### Weekly [EURUSD][3] trading plan

In my opinion, the ongoing uncertainty in the US politics, as well as
the divergence in economic growth and monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), speak in favour
of shorting [EURUSD][1] on the rise in the direction of 1.1795-1.1805
and 1.186-1.187.
