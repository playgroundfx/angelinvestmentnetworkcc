Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD for 05.11.2020Roman
Onegin

Dear readers,

I've prepared for you a short-term forecast for Bitcoin, Ripple and
Ethereum based on the Elliott wave analysis. Also, I've provided trading
recommendations and entry points for each cryptocurrency pair.

Bitcoin's current structure suggests that a bullish impulse is forming
at the moment, with its final part, impulse [5], forming inside.
Apparently, impulse [5] is only half-formed, so it may continue forming
in the near future.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave analysis for Bitcoin

 ****

We see that an ascending impulsive wave C continues forming. It consists
of five sub-waves [1]-[2]-[3]-[4]-[5]. Most likely, the fourth part of
this pattern has developed recently as corrective wave [4] in the form
of double three (w)-(x)-(y). Then, the first part of the ultimate
bullish impulse [5] started forming. In the near future, we may see the
price rising to the level of 15200.00. Under this scenario, long
positions can be considered.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] for today:

Buy at 14344.00, TP at 15200.00

## Elliott wave analysis for Ripple

 ****

XRPUSD continues building a corrective wave B in the form of a triple
zigzag. Inside it, there has formed the second linking wave [X], which
looks like a triple combination. The first part of bullish wave [Z] is
forming at the moment. The price is likely to continue growing to the
previous peak at 0.263 in the near future. Under this scenario, long
positions can be considered.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] for today:

Buy at 0.240, TP at 0.263

* * *

## Elliott wave analysis for Ethereum

 ****

Ethereum continues forming a large corrective wave B shaped as double
zigzag [W]-[X]-[Y]. By its inner structure, wave [Y] is a triple zigzag
(w)-(x)-(y)-(xx)-(z). The second linking wave (xx) has formed lately. It
is a triple zigzag of smaller wave degree. The price is soaring in the
ultimate actionary wave (z) at the moment. It is likely to end near the
level of 423.00, i.e. the previous peak's area.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] for today:

Buy at 404.85, TP at 423.00
