Pound to shoot the moon. Forecast as of 16.09.2021Dmitri Demidenko

During the recovery of the global economy, those currencies whose
issuing central banks are the first to normalize monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) are
becoming popular. In this regard, [GBPUSD][1] consolidation looks
logical. Let us discuss the Forex outlook and make up a trading plan.

## Monthly pound fundamental forecast

At first, any high inflation seems temporary, but the consequences can
be dire if you miss the moment when it becomes uncontrollable. According
to the Bank of Russia, the Fed will provoke a new global economic crisis
if it changes its position on the temporary nature of high values ​​of
the PCE index and begins to raise the federal funds rate aggressively.
The significance of the Bank of England's mistake for the world economy
is significantly lower, but it can have colossal consequences for the
UK.

The BoE was initially wrong about inflation. According to its May
forecast, inflation was set to rise to 2.5% by the end of 2021. In
August, the Bank of England raised the estimate to 4%, but the
trajectory of the actual movement of consumer prices suggests that it
will also be underestimated. According to the results of the last month
of summer, the British CPI accelerated to 3.2%, surpassing the most
aggressive forecast of Bloomberg experts. It seems like the fastest
inflation dynamics since March 2012.

### Inflation and forecasts of the Bank of England

This fact, together with strong labor market data, where the number of
vacancies in the second quarter increased by 35% QoQ to a record 1.03
million, allows the Bank of England to tighten its monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). Most
likely, against the background of an improvement in the epidemiological
situation, most of the 1.6 million unemployed will find new jobs in
2022.

After the release of strong inflation data, the money market began to
expect an increase in the interest rate in May and the second half of
next year. These are good [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) for the sterling.

### Dynamics of market expectations for the interest rate

In general, the pound in early autumn has a lot in common with the US
dollar. Inflation in both the UK and the US is at high levels as well as
the number of unemployed. The same economic slowdown in the third
quarter after its rapid growth in the second. Even the meetings of the
Fed and the Bank of England will be held one day apart.

Nevertheless, the significance of the greenback for Forex, its status as
a safe haven, the fact that the US GDP has already recovered, in
contrast to the British one, made it possible to say that the positions
of the [GBPUSD][1] bears are better than those of their opponents.
Curiously, the consensus forecast by 76 Bloomberg experts suggests that
the pair will rise to 1.39 by the end of 2021.

Even though I prefer the US dollar, in my opinion, sterling is by no
means a weak currency. A possible increase in the interest rate at two
BoE meetings in 2022 will determine GBP's fate for at least the next six
months and give reasons to buy it against other G10 currencies. The
divergence in the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the Bank of England with the ECB
allows expecting the continuation of the [EURGBP][2] downtrend in the
direction of 0.846 and 0.839. The fact that the SNB will not raise rates
before the European Central Bank, and the Bank of Japan will remain
committed to aggressive monetary stimuli, allows buying [GBPCHF][3] and
[GBPJPY][4] with targets at 1.285 and 1.295, 152.3 and 153.6,
respectively.
