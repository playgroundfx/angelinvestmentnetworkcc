Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 16.09.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

Yesterday, the idea of selling gold in the Intermediary Zone 1803 - 1801
yielded profits.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

Yesterday, oil had worked out its priority buying scenario and reached
Target Zone 2 72.85 - 72.32. Further growth will depend on the buyers'
ability to break out Target Zone 2. If successful, the next target
within the short-term uptrend will be Gold Zone 2 75.12 - 74.87.

Nevertheless, it makes sense to consider new purchases at strong
supports with a target at yesterday's high during downward price
corrections.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

  1. Buy according to the pattern in Additional Zone 71.60 - 71.47. TakeProfit: 72.66. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. Buy according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 70.32 - 70.07. TakeProfit: 72.66. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

Yesterday, the idea of selling gold in the Intermediary Zone 1803 - 1801
with the target at level 1784 yielded profits. The further decline will
depend on the sellers' ability to consolidate the price below level
1784. If successful, then the new target for sales will be the Gold Zone
1772 - 1770.

It will be relevant to consider gold purchases only after the short-term
trend's reversal up. To make it possible the breakout of the
Intermediary Zone and price consolidation higher are required.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

Watch the market.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

The euro traders didn't break out the zone of good sell prices 1.1867 -
1.1858. The short-term trend is down. The target of the fall is level
1.1774. The next target will be the Target Zone 1.1733 - 1.1715.

Today, it is reasonable to hold euro sell trades entered in the zone
with a stop either at breakeven or beyond the September 14 high.

To enter euro purchases, it is required that buyers break out the
Intermediary Zone 1.1867 - 1.1858 and consolidate the price above.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

Hold down sales entered in the zone of 1.1867 - 1.1858. TakeProfit:
1.1774, Target Zone 1.1733 - 1.1715. StopLoss: 1.1848.
