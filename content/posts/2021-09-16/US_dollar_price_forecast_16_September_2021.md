Dollar acts according to plan. Forecast as of 16.09.2021Dmitri Demidenko

The higher GDP rate in the euro area than in the US in the second and
third quarters is deceiving. The currency bloc has not yet recovered
from the recession while the US has. How does this affect [EURUSD][1]?
Let us discuss the Forex outlook and make up a trading plan.

## Weekly US dollar fundamental forecast

There is a calm before the storm in the market. Investors wonder if the
Fed will announce tapering the QE at its September meeting or will wait
until November. The second scenario looks more preferable against the
backdrop of disappointing statistics on US employment and inflation,
confusion with the public debt ceiling, and a new package of fiscal
stimulus from Joe Biden. However, I have a feeling that the central bank
will choose the first variant. Therefore, one could sell the [EURUSD][1]
on the price rise.

Although the pandemic hasn’t finished yet, the global economy is much
stronger than one could have assumed a year ago. The recession is not as
dangerous as what follows after it. A long period of high unemployment
and low sales ruins private and business capital. A quick return to
normalcy should save years of economic potential that might otherwise be
wasted. If you look at GDP from this point of view, the fact that the US
economy recovered in the second quarter, and its European counterpart
will be able to do this only by the end of 2021, should encourage the
[EURUSD][1] bears.

### Dynamics of euro-area GDP

Simply put, the United States has already recovered from the recession
and does not spend its energy to support the economic recovery, as the
euro area does. So what difference does the growth rate make if the
opponents have different tasks?

A decline in employment growth and inflation? I see no particular reason
for refusing to start normalizing monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). The economy is
returning to its normal growth rate after an abnormally high rate
associated with a robust post-opening recovery. No one should be
confused by JP Morgan's downgrade of US GDP forecasts for the third
quarter from 7% to 5%. On the contrary, the bank raised its estimates
for October-December from 3% to 3.5%.

Thus, the outperformance of the euro-area economy in the middle of this
year is confusing. If everything were that simple, the ECB would also
begin to abandon monetary stimulus. However, the ECB chief economist
Philip Lane does not recommend that [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s equate monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
with QE asset purchases. The central bank predicts inflation of 1.5% in
2023, which implies a prolonged period of low interest rates and
weakness in the regional currency. If the Germans are not afraid of
inflation on the eve of the most important parliamentary elections of
the last generation, why should the ECB be worried about its
acceleration to 3%?

### Weekly[ EURUSD][2] trading plan

The divergence between the monetary policies of the euro area and the
USA is obvious. That is the reason for the [EURUSD][1] downtrend.
Investors are focused on the potential changes in monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) ahead
of the possibly [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) FOMC meeting. The Fed will act according to
the plan and the expectations of a soon start of tapering the QE suggest
selling the euro versus the US dollar down to 1.1755 and 1.1715 on the
price rise.
