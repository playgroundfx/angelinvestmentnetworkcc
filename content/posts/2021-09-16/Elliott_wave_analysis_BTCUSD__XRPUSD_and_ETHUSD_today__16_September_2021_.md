Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 16.09.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

The BTC and ETHUSD completed complex correctives waves, so there should
be unfolding impulses.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

The BTCUSD must have completed the first two sub-waves 1 and 2 of the
impulse down wave. Wave 1 is an impulse, correction 2 is a triple zigzag
[W]-[X]-[Y]-[X]-[Z]. Correction 2 must have completed, so, the market
should be declining in impulse 3 to a level below 41800.00, marked by
wave 1. One could enter sell trades in the current situation.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Sell 47916.50, TP 41800.00

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

The XRPUSD market is forming the inceptive part of the bearish wave,
which is unfolding as a simple five-wave impulse. There is developing
the third sub-wave of the potential impulse, where sub-waves [1]-[2]
look complete. The price should continue falling towards a level of
0.950, marked by impulse 1, and lower.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] **** today:

Sell 1.105, TP 0.950

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

The ETHUSD market has started forming a new down wave. The first two
parts of the bearish impulse, waves 1 and 2, finished. Wave 1 is an
impulse, corrective wave 2 is a double three, composed of sub-waves
[W]-[X]-[Y]. The price should continue falling wave 3 to a level below
2895.00. One could enter sell trades in the current situation.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Sell 3584.22, TP 2895.00
