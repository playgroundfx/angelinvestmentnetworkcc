USDCAD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 21.05.2021 –
28.05.2021Alex Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 1.2198 with a target of 1.1850 – 1.1700.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
1.2198 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 1.2361 –
1.2560.

 **Analysis:** Daily time frame: wave (С) of 4 of larger degree
continues developing, with the third wave 3 of (C) forming inside. The
fifth wave v of 3 continues forming on the H4 time frame, with wave (v)
of v developing inside. Apparently, the fifth wave of smaller degree (v)
of v is developing on the H1 time frame. If this assumption is correct,
the pair will continue to fall to 1.1850 – 1.1700. The level of 1.2198
is critical in this scenario, as the breakout will enable the pair to
continue rising to the levels of 1.2361 – 1.2560.
