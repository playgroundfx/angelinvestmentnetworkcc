USDCHF: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 21.05.2021 –
28.05.2021Alex Geuta

 **Main scenario:** long positions will be relevant above the level of
0.8753 with a target of 0.9505 – 0.9590 once correction has formed.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
0.8753 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of 0.8600
– 0.8500.

 **Analysis:** Daily time frame: presumably, a descending first wave of
larger degree (1) of 5 has formed and an ascending correction is now
developing as second wave (2) of 5. H4 time frame: wave A of (2) has
formed and wave B of (2) is nearing completion. Apparently, wave с of В
continues developing on the H1 time frame, with first wave (v) of c
forming inside. If the presumption is correct, the pair will continue to
grow to the levels of 0.9505 – 0.9590 once wave B of (2) is completed.
The level of 0.8753 is critical in this scenario. Its breakout will
allow the pair to continue falling to the levels of 0.8600 – 0.8500.
