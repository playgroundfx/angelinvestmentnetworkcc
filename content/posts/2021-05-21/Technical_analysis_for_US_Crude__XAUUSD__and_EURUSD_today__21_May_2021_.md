Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 21.05.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

The priority pattern for selling oil in the Additional Zone 63.39 -
63.26 yielded profits.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

The priority pattern for selling oil in the Additional Zone 63.39 -
63.26 yielded profits. The Target Zone 61.69 - 61.16 was reached. The
further decline within the short-term downtrend will depend on the
traders' ability to break out the Target Zone and consolidate the price
below.

Since the trend remains down, today it is profitable to look for oil
sales at strong resistances: Additional Zone 63.10 - 62.97 and
Intermediary Zone 64.56 - 64.29. The target will be the local low.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

  1. Sell according to the pattern in Additional Zone 63.10 - 62.97. TakeProfit: 61.69. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. Sell according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 64.56 - 64.29. TakeProfit: 61.69. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

The short-term gold uptrend continues. Traders are now trying to break
out the Gold Zone 1878 - 1876. If successful, the next target will be
Target Zone 2 1903 - 1898.

Yesterday, traders tested the trend border 1867-1865. The price didn't
break it out. A “1-2-3” buy pattern has been formed today. It is
reasonable to use this pattern and buy gold with a target in Target Zone
2.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

Buy according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 1867 - 1865.
TakeProfit: Target Zone 2 1903 - 1898. StopLoss: according to the
pattern rules.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

There haven't been any single pattern to enter trades in the zone of
1.2208 - 1.2196. As a result, the resistance zone was broken out, and
the euro price again reached Target Zone 1.2245 - 1.2227.

The Target Zone is a strong resistance. For further growth, traders need
to consolidate the price above the zone at the US trading session. In
this case, the target will be the Gold Zone 1.2324 - 1.2315.

The short-term trend's border remains in the zone of 1.2157 - 1.2148.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

Buy according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 1.2157 - 1.2148.
TakeProfit: 1.2245. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.
