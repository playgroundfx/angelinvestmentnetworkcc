Will dollar open Pandora’s box? Forecast as of 21.05.2021Dmitri
Demidenko

Investors are concerned that a repeat of 2013 events with the tapering
of the US QE will result in turmoil in financial markets. I do not think
so. Let us discuss the Forex outlook and make up a [EURUSD][1] trading
plan.

## Quarterly US dollar fundamental forecast

It took markets less than 24 hours to recover from the shock resulted
from the FOMC April meeting’s minutes. After all, the phrase that some
of the FOMS members would consider it appropriate to start discussing
the tapering of the QE does not mean that the Fed will wind down the
asset purchases under the quantitative easing program. I do not think
the Fed will take such a risk now. If so, the [EURUSD][1] bulls could
safely continue the rally.

If the Fed planned to raise the interest rates in early 2023, it should
end the quantitative easing program by that time, and the most
preferable time to start normalizing monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) seems to be late
2021. Jerome Powell could announce the tapering of QE at the meeting of
central banks’ presidents in Jackson Hole in late summer, and the
discussion of this issue could begin in June. Such a plan looks logical,
but everything that seems reasonable does not mean that the Fed will
take active steps.

Should [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s worry about withdrawing the quantitative easing, which
resulted in a taper tantrum in 2013? I do not think so. The central
bank’s Treasury holdings have doubled since March 2020, accounting for
nearly one-quarter of the total outstanding, a bigger share than it held
even after the 2008 credit crisis. Even if it does not buy assets at a
monthly pace of $120 billion, it is expected to keep its holdings steady
by buying new Treasuries whenever old ones mature, reducing the amount
that would need to be sold to the public. That’s given some [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s
confidence that rates won’t rise too quickly

### Dynamics of Fed total assets

Even if the Fed starts tapering talks already in June, the US dollar
will strengthen only for the short term. The [EURUSD][1] uptrend should
continue. In the near future, it is Europe that will become an example
of recovery after the pandemic, and the rise in producer prices in
Germany by 5.2% Y-o-Y in April, the highest in almost 10 years,
increases the risks of hawks' attack at the June meeting of the ECB.
Yes, the ECB Chief Economist Philip Lane claims that the recent spike in
some prices due to bottlenecks in production was "not inflation" but
merely a temporary misalignment between supply and demand. However, the
ECB Governing Council is not a one-man show.

### Quarterly [EURUSD][1] trading plan

Euro has many benefits of its own, including the potential victory of
the Green party in September's Federal election, which will increase the
chance of the fiscal stimulus boost. Furthermore, Joe Biden’s
administration is to reduce import tariffs on European goods. Therefore,
the [EURUSD][1] uptrend is far from being exhausted. Strong May PMI
reports in Germany and in the euro area could support the euro rally. It
is still relevant to buy the euro-dollar with the upside targets at 1.24
and 1.255.
