EURUSD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 21.05.2021 –
28.05.2021Alex Geuta

 **Main scenario:** short positions will be relevant below the level of
1.2342 with a target of 1.1600 – 1.1489.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
1.2342 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 1.2500 –
1.2600.

 **Analysis:** Daily time frame: presumably, the first wave of larger
degree 1 of (3) has formed, and a downside correction is forming as wave
2 of (3). Apparently, wave a of 2 formed and an ascending wave b of 2 is
nearing completion on the H4 time frame. Wave (c) of b seems to be
nearing completion on the H1 time frame, with the final wave v of (c)
forming inside. If the presumption is correct, the pair will continue to
drop to the levels of 1.1600 – 1.1489 once wave b of 2 is completed. The
level of 1.2342 is critical in this scenario. Its breakout will allow
the pair to continue rising to the levels of 1.2500 – 1.2600.
