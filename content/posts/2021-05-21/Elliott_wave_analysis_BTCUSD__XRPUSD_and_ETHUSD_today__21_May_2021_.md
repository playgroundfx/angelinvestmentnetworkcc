Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 21.05.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

Bitcoin and Ethereum are forming middle parts of bearish impulses, so
the price should continue falling.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

It is clear from the BTCUSD price chart that the upward corrective wave
2 completed as a zigzag. Next, the market started forming a bearish
impulse wave which should be composed of five sub-waves
[1]-[2]-[3]-[4]-[5]. There have completed the first two legs, a five-
wave impulse [1] and a zigzag-shaped correction [2]. There is unfolding
the third impulse wave, namely its middle part, sub-wave (3). Correction
4 has completed in wave (3), so the price should be declining in wave 5
to a level of 29800.00.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Sell 40715.61, TP 29800.00

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

The XRPUSD market must be developing the down wave (W) as a simple
zigzag composed of three major sub-waves A-B-C. Impulse wave A and
correction B must have finished. Correction B had been unfolding over a
month and completed as a double zigzag. There is likely to be forming
the bearish impulse C as an impulse composed of the sub-waves
[1]-[2]-[3]-[4]-[5]. There is likely to be developing the final wave
[5], which should end at a level around 0.777.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] today:

Sell 1.159 TP 0.777

## Elliott wave Ethereum analysis

The ETHUSD market is developing the inceptive part of the new bear
trend. There is likely to be forming a bear impulse, with the first sub-
waves 1 and 2 completed inside. There have also completed the sub-waves
[1] and [2] of a smaller degree. There is likely to be forming impulse
[3], namely its sub-wave 5. The Ethereum price could go down to a level
of 1800.00. It is relevant to enter sell trades.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Sell 2775.92, TP 1800.00
