XAUUSD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 21.05.2021 –
28.05.2021Alex Geuta

 **Main scenario:** long positions will be relevant above the level of
1757.43 with a target of 1958.14 – 2078.03 once the correction has
formed.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
1757.43 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of
1675.55 – 1650.00.

 **Analysis:** An ascending third wave of larger degree (3) formed on
the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame, and a descending correction developed as wave (4),
supposedly. The fifth wave (5) appears to be forming on the H4 time
frame, with the first wave of smaller degree 1 of (5) formed inside.
Supposedly, a downside correction is starting to form as wave 2 of (5)
on the H1 time frame. If this assumption is correct, the pair will
continue to rise to the levels of 1958.14 – 2078.03 once the
correction’s over. The level of 1757.43 is critical in this scenario, as
the breakout will enable the pair to continue declining to the levels of
1675.55 – 1650.00.
