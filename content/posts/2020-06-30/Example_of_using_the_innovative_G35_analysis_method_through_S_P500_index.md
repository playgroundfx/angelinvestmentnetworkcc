G35: asset valuation method through the example of S&P500Mikhail Hypov

##  **G35: Author’s method for valuation of stock indexes and shares. By
Michael Hypov**

My previous article was devoted to the [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) of gold pricing. We found
out that [gold quotes][1] can be used for comparing the price of any
asset to a price which would have existed in the Gold standard period.
The article can be found [here][2]. Today we’ll proceed to study gold
and its area of application. Also, we’ll make a technical analysis of
[S&P500][3] and compare it with its possible value based on the gold
standard.

I suggest calling my valuation method “G35” and adding “G35” to the
designation of an instrument analysed on the basis of the gold standard.
For example, the ticker of S&P500, [SPX][4], will look like SPXG35.

 **G35 signals**

You may remember that it’s better not to use this method on small time
frames because the [gold][1] industry factors may affect the quality of
signals. The method shows the market’s fundamental sentiment relative to
high risk assets. The main advantage and disadvantage is that the
indicator may forestall real events and reflect deep market changes
which will take place a few months or even years later. Also, this
indicator shows the behaviour of “long money” or “intelligent money”
which belongs to institutional [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s and market whales. Every
private [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) dreams of tailing them.

S&P500 index][5]

Have a look at the chart above. The red chart shows [S&P500][3]’s
dynamics “as is” while the blue one takes account of the gold standard.
The first thing we see is that the two charts strongly diverged from
2009 to 2012. [S&P500][4] was growing rapidly while SPXG35 was in a long
sideways trend with a bearish angle.  The divergence may be explained by
the following fact: the 2009-2012 growth of the stock market took place
amid additional money emissions and liquidity injections. It wasn’t due
to a real economic growth. In the meanwhile, institutional [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s
preferred keeping their money in gold. There was no trust in high risk
assets and in stock particularly.  In that situation, opening long
positions in the long term wasn’t safe for a private [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) - another
fall could happen.

Next, SPXG35 starts growing in 2013. The bearish trend is broken. This
signal may be understood as a fundamental change in the market sentiment
and a growing demand for high risk assets. For private [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s, this
is a signal of a stable long-term bullish trend. So, there’s a good
opportunity for opening long positions in the long term.

![LiteForex: Example of using the innovative G35 analysis method through
S&P500 index][6]

The 2013-2015 growth of the S&P500 index turned out to be one of the
fastest and most stable ones in the past ten years. In the second half
of 2015, we see another interesting signal - a convergence between
[SPX][4] and SPXG35. In the chart above we see that latter updated its
maximums in contrast to [SPX][4].  It can be read as a false correction
and “weak hands” sale of speculative [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s in the stock market.
Thus, we can understand that no important corrections are in store. Big
players continue to express a preference for the stock market and not
for protective instruments. Then, SPXG35 starts growing in 2017, which
confirms the continuation of the bullish trend and coincides with a long
bullish rally in 2017-2018.

![LiteForex: Example of using the innovative G35 analysis method through
S&P500 index][7]

In September 2018, we see a serious bearish pullback but the price
recovers fast in the chart of [S&P500][4] marked as a red line. SPXG35
behaves differently though.  It doesn’t update its maximums. In April
2019, we have the first strong bearish signal. On the one hand, it
points to the start of long money’s flow into protective assets. On the
other hand, it means that the stock market is recovering because of
speculative money. A similar situation occurred in December 2019 before
the stock market collapsed amid the global pandemic.

S&P500 index][8]

Also, we saw something similar on the eve of the 2008 crisis. Back then,
we got the first signal at the end of 2005, almost two years before the
crisis itself. Another signal was produced right before the start of the
correction.

 **Crisis of dotcom companies as an example of an internal factor of
gold pricing**

However, the dotcom crisis example shows that an error in signals may
occur even on such a big time frame as 1 month.

![LiteForex: Example of using the innovative G35 analysis method through
S&P500 index][9]

The chart above shows that only one signal was produced on the eve of
the crisis, at the beginning of 2000. However, when the market reached
its peak in August, SPXG35 followed it and updated its maximums.

![LiteForex: Example of using the innovative G35 analysis method through
S&P500 index][10]

Laying a gold price dynamics chart over the chart above, we see that the
dotcom crisis didn’t lead to a higher demand for [gold][1] unlike other
crisis periods. The thing is that the dotcom crisis was specific as it
hit hard IT companies which are the main consumers of microelectronics
and, as a consequence, gold. Big [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s and hedge funds understood
that and didn’t reinvest in [gold][1] as a protective asset. Thus, that
internal market [demand][1] factor distorted the general picture.

 **Forecast for the US stock market based on G35 indicator**

![LiteForex: Example of using the innovative G35 analysis method through
S&P500 index][11]

The chart above shows SPXG35 and [SPX ][4] on the monthly time frame. In
the upper chart, the blue line of SPXG35 is within the limits of a
bearish trend. Based on the ultimate fall wave and channel traded in the
second half of 2008, we can single out a strong support level marked as
a green rectangle. The likeliest scenario doesn’t imply that this
support area will be broken. So, the indicator will consolidate under
the pressure of a bearish trend. The consolidation may last up to 2022.
A breakup of the bearish trend line will suggest a long-term bullish
signal. So, a bullish trend is unlikely to be developing this year and
during the first half of 2021.

![LiteForex: Example of using the innovative G35 analysis method through
S&P500 index][12]

At the same time we see that the ultimate monthly candlestick of the
SPXG35 indicator closes as a “shooting star” with a long shadow above.
It’s a bearish signal of a further downward movement. This pattern may
be read as a confirming bearish signal combined with other indicators
which point to a bearish trend in [S&P500][3].

 **Conclusion**

The G35 method of comparing an asset cost with the potential value in
the Gold standard period is a good leading indicator which can be used
for confirming other [trading strategies](https://www.fintechee.com/forex-trading-strategies/) or minimizing the risk of loss.
When using this approach, we need to consider internal market factors of
[gold][1] pricing to avoid false signals.   This indicator will be of
little use for trading instruments whose price directly correlates with
[gold][1] prices. As for the [S&P500][3] index, I can say for sure that
the current situation isn’t favourable to long-term investing based on
the G35 analysis method. Long money escapes stock as it’s a high risk
asset. The current growth is related to private [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s’ growing
activity and large money emissions, which must stimulate the stock
market as well. Another crisis wave is quite likely to happen. So, short
positions in [S&P500][3] remain a priority.

You can open a short position in S&P500 at LiteForex too. If you aren’t
a trader, it’s time to start right now: the broker is raffling fabulous
prizes to celebrate its [15th anniversary][13].  Both beginner and
professional traders may win!
