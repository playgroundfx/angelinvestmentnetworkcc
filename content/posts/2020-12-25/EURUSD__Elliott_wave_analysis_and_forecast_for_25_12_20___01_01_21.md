EURUSD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 25.12.20 – 01.01.21Alex
Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions from corrections above the
level of 1.2120 with a target of 1.2330 – 1.2400.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
1.2120 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of 1.2005
– 1.1944.

 **Analysis:** Daily time frame: presumably, the first wave of larger
degree 1 of (3) continues developing, with wave iii of 1 formed inside.
On the H4 time frame, a local correction has been formed as the fourth
wave iv of 1, and wave v of 1 is forming. Apparently, the third wave of
smaller degree (iii) of v has been completed and a local correction (iv)
of v is developing on the H1 time frame. If the presumption is correct,
the pair will continue to rise to the levels of 1.2330 – 1.2400. The
level of 1.2120 is critical in this scenario. Its breakout will allow
the pair to continue falling to the levels of 1.2005 – 1.1944.
