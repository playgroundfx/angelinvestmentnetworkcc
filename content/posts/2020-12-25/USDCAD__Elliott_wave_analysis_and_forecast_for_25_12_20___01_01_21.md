USDCAD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 25.12.20 – 01.01.21Alex
Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 1.2953 with a target of 1.2600 – 1.2400.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
1.2953 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 1.3174 –
1.3384.

 **Analysis:** Daily time frame: wave (С) of 4 of larger degree
continues developing, with the first wave 1 of (C) forming inside. On
the H4 time frame, the fifth wave v of 1 of (C) is forming. Inside it,
there is a wave of smaller degree (iii) of v forming. On the H1 time
frame, wave iii of (iii) has been formed and local correction iv of
(iii) has been completed. If the presumption is correct, the pair will
continue to drop to the levels of 1.2600 – 1.2400. The level of 1.2953
is critical in this scenario, as the breakout will enable the pair to
continue rising to the levels of 1.3174 – 1.3384.
