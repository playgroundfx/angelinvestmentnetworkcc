XAUUSD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 25.12.20 - 01.01.21Alex
Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions from corrections above the
level of 1818.00 with the target of 1932.62 – 1965.30.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
1818.00 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of
1760.88 – 1718.57.

 **Analysis:** Daily time frame: presumably, the ascending third wave of
larger degree (3) formed, and a descending correction has been completed
as wave (4). On the H4 time frame, the fifth wave (5) has started
developing with wave 1 of (5) forming inside. H1 time frame: a wave of
smaller degree iii of 1 and a local correction iv of 1 have been
completed. If the assumption is correct, the pair will continue rising
to the levels of 1932.62 – 1965.30. The level of 1818.00 is critical in
this scenario, as the breakout will enable the pair to continue
declining to the levels of 1760.88 – 1718.57.
