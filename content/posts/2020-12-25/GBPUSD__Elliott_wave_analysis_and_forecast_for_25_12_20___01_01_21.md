GBPUSD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 25.12.20 – 01.01.21Alex
Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions from corrections above the
level of 1.3303 ****with the target of 1.3700 – 1.3800.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
1.3303 ****will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of
1.3194 – 1.3128.

 **Analysis:** Daily time frame: presumably, the first wave of larger
degree (1) continues developing, with wave 5 of (1) forming inside. On
the H4 time frame, the third wave of smaller degree iii of 5 has been
completed and a local correction as wave iv of 5 has been completed. On
the H1 time frame, wave v of 5 is developing with wave (iii) of v
forming inside. If the presumption is correct, the pair will continue to
rise to the levels of 1.3700 – 1.3800. The level of 1.3303 ****is
critical in this scenario as its breakout will enable the pair to
continue declining to the levels of 1.3194 – 1.3128.
