USDCHF: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 25.12.20 - 01.01.21Alex
Geuta

 **Main scenario:** Consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 0.8982 with the target of 0.8750 – 0.8650.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
0.8982 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 0.9093 –
0.9192.

 **Analysis:** Presumably, the descending first wave of larger degree
(1) of 5 continues developing on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame, with wave 5 of
(1) forming inside. On the H4 time frame, there is the fifth wave of
smaller degree v of 5 developing, with wave (iii) of v forming inside.
Apparently, wave iii of (iii) has been completed and a local correction
iv of (iii) is close to being completed on the H1 time frame. If this
assumption is correct, the pair will continue to fall to 0.8750 –
0.8650. The level of 0.8982 is critical in this scenario. Its breakout
will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 0.9093 – 0.9192.
