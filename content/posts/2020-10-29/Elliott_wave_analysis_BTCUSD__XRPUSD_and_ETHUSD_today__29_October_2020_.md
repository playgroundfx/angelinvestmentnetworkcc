Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 29.10.2020Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I suggest entry signals
to trade each cryptocurrency.

After a slight decline in the market of BTCUSD in the corrective wave
[4], prices are expected to continue to rise.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

 ****

Bitcoin continues to move according to the scenario I predicted. The
upward impulse wave C is developing, it consists of five sub-waves
[1]-[2]-[3]-[4]-[5]. Most likely, the first three parts of this pattern
are fully completed, and now the market is forming a downward correction
[4] which may be a small simple zigzag (a)-(b)-(c), as shown in the
chart. After this correction is completed, the market will continue to
rise in wave [5] towards the level of 15200.00.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 13237.00, TP 15200.00

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

 ****

The triple zigzag [W]-[X]-[Y]-[X]-[Z] is developing, it forms an upward
corrective wave B. The actionary sub-waves [W] and [Y] and two linking
waves [X] and [X] have already been fully completed. At the moment, wave
[Z] is developing, it takes the form of a double zigzag (w)-(x)-(y). The
linking wave (x) is presumably a triple zigzag and is already close to
its end. The market may reverse soon and after that, the final wave (y)
may rise to the level of 0.273 as shown in the chart.

### Trading plan for **[XRPUSD][2]** today:

Buy 0.245, TP 0.273

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

 ****

Same as with XRPUSD, here a bullish corrective trend is developing.
Correction B takes the form of a double zigzag [W]-[X]-[Y]. Wave [Y] in
this pattern is longer than the first two sub-waves but also has a
simple zigzag-like shape. As part of the impulse wave (C), which is
developing, the corrective wave [4] came to an end, it took the form of
a bearish triple zigzag. In the near future, I expect the price to rise
in wave [5] to the level of 443.00.

### Trading plan for  **[ETHUSD][3] **today:

Buy 390.34, TP 443.00
