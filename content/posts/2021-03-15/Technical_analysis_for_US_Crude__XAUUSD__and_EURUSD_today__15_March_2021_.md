Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 15.03.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

Last week, the euro/dollar short-term trend reversed up and approached
the Target Zone 1.2011 - 1.1995.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

Last week on Thursday, the short-term oil trend reversed up.
Intermediary Zone 65.57 - 65.35 was broken out. The US session closed
higher. The growth target for the current week is the Target Zone 68.06
- 67.61.

Now the bulls are trying to consolidate the price above the last week's
local highs. If successful, the price will reach the Target Zone. If the
price consolidation fails, then a correction to the Additional Zone
65.29 - 65.18 will occur, which serves as the zone for entering
purchases according to the trend.

When the Additional Zone is broken out, it will be possible to sell oil
with the target in the Intermediary Zone 64.16 - 63.93.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

  1. If the price consolidates above level 66.10, buy on the retest. TakeProfit: Target Zone 68.06 - 67.61. StopLoss: beyond the level of 66.10.

  2. Buy according to the pattern in Additional Zone 65.29 - 65.18. TakeProfit: 66.33. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

Gold is again testing the border of the short-term downtrend -
Intermediary Zone 1731 - 1726. While the resistance is holding, look for
sales according to the pattern with the target at the March 8 low,
around level 1680.

As soon as the Intermediary Zone is broken out, the trend will reverse
up. Major traders will buy the precious metal with the target at the
Target Zone 1786 - 1776. However, first, they need to break out the
resistance level of 1738 and close the US trading session higher.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

  1. Sell according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 1731 - 1726. TakeProfit: 1680. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. If the price breaks out level 1738, buy at Intermediary Zone 1731 - 1726. TakeProfit: Target Zone 1786 - 1776. StopLoss: beyond the local low.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

Last week, the euro/dollar short-term trend reversed up and approached
the Target Zone 1.2011 - 1.1995. However, the target was never reached.
Instead, the price went into a correction and tested the trend border
1.1910 - 1.1902.

The traders didn't manage to break out the Intermediary Zone. Thus, we
saw their reaction to the support test. This is a sign of the bulls'
strength, so from today, it is profitable to plan to buy the euro near
levels 1.1917, 1.1905. It is possible to use the resistance levels
1.1960 and 1.1989 as intermediary targets for purchases.

Selling the euro requires the closing of the US trading session below
the Intermediary Zone. In this case, the short-term trend will change.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

  1. Open buy positions near levels 1.1916 - 1.1905. TakeProfit: 1.1989. StopLoss: 1.1887.

  2. If the price breaks out level 1.1905 and consolidates below, sell on the retest. TakeProfit: 1.1838. StopLoss: beyond the local high.
