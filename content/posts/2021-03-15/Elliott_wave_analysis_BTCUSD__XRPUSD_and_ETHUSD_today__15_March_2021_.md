Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 15.03.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

The BTCUSD and the ETHUSD should continue rising in the impulse wave
over the next few days. The XRPUSD should shortly finish the triangle
corrective wave, which will be followed by the price decline in the
impulse.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

The BTCUSD pair completed the corrective down wave 4 as a simple zigzag
[A]-[B]-[C]. Next, the price started rising in the impulse. There have
completed sub-waves [1]and [2], and the impulse wave [3] has completed 3
sub-waves of a smaller degree out of 5. There should complete the
bearish corrective wave (4), followed by the price rise in the final
impulse (5) to a level of 64500.00, as outlined in the chart.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 60418.50, TP 64500.00

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

On the hourly XRPUSD price chart, there is forming the corrective wave
(D), which is an element of a larger triangle. Wave (D) is unfolding as
a bearish double zigzag W-X-Y. The final motive sub-wave Y of this
zigzag is currently forming. The Y wave should end as a standard zigzag
[A]-[B]-[C]. The price should soon start rising in the (E) wave, which
is an element of the triangle correction [B], to a level of 0.482, which
is the resistance level.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] today:

Buy 0.445, TP 0.482

## Elliott wave Ethereum analysis

The ETHUSD market is forming a large impulse wave C, with the bearish
correction (4) recently completed inside as a simple zigzag A-B-C. There
is now forming the impulse wave (5), namely, its final leg. Within wave
5, there have completed the first two sub-waves [1] and [2]. Therefore,
the market should be rising in sub-waves [3]-[4]-[5], as it is outlined
in the chart. The entire wave 5 could end at a level of around 2130.00.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Buy 1881.95, TP 2130.00
