XAU/USD forecast: Four nuts for goldDmitri Demidenko

## Fundamental gold price forecast for today

### Gold can still break through its all-time highs

The huge monetary stimulus provided by the world’s leading central
banks, and the weakness of the world’s major currencies have driven the
gold price to the levels it was last seen in 2011. Will the growth of
the inflation, or, maybe, stagflation, help gold to break through the
all-time highs. When the XAU/USD bears are tired of fighting and are
giving in, it doesn’t look like something unreal. According to
Citigroup, the record high will be updated during 6-9 months. Besides,
there is a 30% chance that the gold price will go up higher than $2000
per ounce in 3-5 months.

Ultra-low monetary policies of the central banks, the drop in the bonds
real yields, a big flow of capitals into the gold [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/)s, and the
redistribution of assets in the [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s’ portfolios allow the
[XAU/USD][1] bulls to go ahead. Gold has already hot mew all-time highs
against all G10 currencies except for the US dollar. It seems that the
gold will soon break through the local high in trading versus the
greenback. In addition to the high demand for [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/) products, there is a
rise in the demand for the inflation-protected bonds in July, as well as
the drop in the USD index. All three factors are positive for gold.

The [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/) gold holdings have increased by 450 tons, or $27 billion, since
mid-July. It has become one of the major benefits of gold. The indicator
has reached a record high of more than 3200 tons. During six months,
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s bought the gold [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/) products more than all central banks
together in 2018-2019.

### Dynamics of gold and [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/) holdings

Earlier, bulls the [XAU/USD][1] bulls bet on the weakness of the world’s
major currencies resulted from the huge monetary stimulus. Now, they are
focused on inflation. Although the US PCE is far from the Fed’s target
of 2%, 30-year Treasury inflation-protected securities are close to an
all-time low, the yields on the 5-year and 10-year TIPS are close to the
lowest levels since 2013 and 2012. In the week through July 8, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s
invested about $5 billion in the related [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/)s, having turned the trend
of the capital outflow from the exchange-traded funds. The market
expects the growth of the inflation rate, it is not confused by the
current levels of the PCE and CPI. BofA Merrill Lynch says the US
economy may face stagflation when the GDP is not recovering but the
prices are growing.

In addition to the weakness of the world major currencies, including the
US dollar, low Treasury real yields, and the expectations for the growth
in consumer prices, another important growth driver for the [XAU/USD][1]
is the redistribution of the [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s’ assets. Stocks look too
expensive according to the P/E ratio. Therefore, even strong US domestic
data do not encourage the [S&P 500][3] bulls. Bonds, unlike the stock
indexes trading in the green, are trading in the red area and also look
overbought. Gold seems much more promising under the current conditions.
So, one could think of increasing the share of gold in the investment
portfolio. If the price breaks through the resistance zone of
$1820-$1825, it makes sense to enter gold longs and take part in the
LiteForex [contest ][4]devoted to the LiteForex 15th anniversary with
excellent prizes.
