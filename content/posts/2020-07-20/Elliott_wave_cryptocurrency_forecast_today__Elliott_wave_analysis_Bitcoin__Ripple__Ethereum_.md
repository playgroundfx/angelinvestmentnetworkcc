The BTCUSD market has completed the long-term corrective wave [4] as a
double combination of zigzags. There is now should be developing a new
bullish wave. There have completed a small upward impulse (1) and a down
correction (2). There is now developing the initial phase of the third
wave, and so, the price should be rising in the near future.

It is clear from the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) XRPUSD price chart that, following the
completion of the down corrective wave (B), the market has started
rising in the impulse wave (C). The (C) can conclude the global wave [Z]
that is an element of the triple zigzag of a larger degree. The sub-
waves 1-2-3-4 look complete, so the price should be rising in wave 5 for
some time. Wave 5 is likely to be a simple impulse.

In the upward impulse wave A of a larger degree, there is forming the
final wave [5], namely its fifth element, wave (5). Wave (5) is likely
to be developing as an ending diagonal. The first four parts of this
diagonal have completed, and the final zigzag (a)-(b)-(c) is now
unfolding. An approximate trajectory of the Ethereum future price
movement is outlined in the chart.
