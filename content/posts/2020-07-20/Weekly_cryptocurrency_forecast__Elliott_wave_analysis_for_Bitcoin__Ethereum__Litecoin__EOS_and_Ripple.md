Weekly Elliott wave cryptocurrency forecast and analysisRoman Onegin

## Forecast for BTCUSD, LTCUSD, ETHUSD, EOSUSD, XRPUSD pairs

###  **Elliott wave analysis for[BTCUSD][1]**

 **![LiteForex: Weekly cryptocurrency forecast. Elliott wave analysis
for Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, EOS and Ripple][2]**

The current BTCUSD market structure suggests that there is developing a
long-term corrective wave 4 as a down double zigzag [W]-[X]-[Y]. Within
this double zigzag of a larger degree, there is now forming the upward
linking wave [X] that is also a double zigzag (W)-(X)-(Y) of a smaller
degree. Let see the structure of the [X] wave in more detail in a
shorter timeframe.

The eight-hour timeframe indicates that the Bitcoin market finished the
down linking wave (X) as a double zigzag W-X-Y. There is now developing
the new upward bullish zigzag A-B-C. There is likely to be forming the
final element of the bullish impulse wave A. The price should be rising
to a level of 10405 in impulse [5] in the near future. Next, the [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)
price should start declining in the corrective wave B, as it is outlined
in the chart.

###  **Elliott wave analysis for[ETHUSD][4]**

The ETHUSD market continues to form the global triple zigzag. The chart
displays the middle part of this triple zigzag. Down wave [Y] has
completed. Now, there is developing the linking upward wave [X] that is
composed of the sub-waves (W)-(X)-(Y) and is unfolding as a double
zigzag. There is now forming the bullish wave (Y) as a normal zigzag
A-B-C. Let us analyze its structure in more detail in the shorter
timeframe.

In the new uptrend, there is developing wave A as a five-wave impulse.
The sub-waves [1]-[2]-[3]-[4] have completed, wave [5] is still
unfolding. It is developing as an ending diagonal (1)-(2)-(3)-(4)-(5).
Wave (5), which is the only incomplete element, could complete as a
simple zigzag, as all the motive waves within this diagonal are zigzags.
The entire diagonal formation should conclude at a level of 260.19.

###  **Elliott wave analysis for[LTCUSD][7]**

 **![LiteForex: Weekly cryptocurrency forecast. Elliott wave analysis
for Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, EOS and Ripple][8]**

The LTCUSD market is forming the down corrective wave B that is
developing as a triple zigzag [W]-[X]-[Y]-[X]-[Z]. There is now forming
the final motive wave [Z] as a down zigzag A)-(B)-(C). The (A) impulse
has completed, the corrective wave (B) is yet unfolding. Let us see its
structure in more detail in the eight-hour timeframe.

After the down impulse wave (A) completed, the market has started rising
in the corrective wave (B). Wave (B) is likely to be developing as a
simple zigzag A-B-C, where wave A is a five-wave impulse, the B
correction is a triple three. Correction B has recently completed, and
the market is likely to be following the initial element of the new
uptrend now, that is wave C. Therefore, the price should be growing in
the next few weeks.

###  **Elliott wave analysis for[EOSUSD][10]**

 **![LiteForex: Weekly cryptocurrency forecast. Elliott wave analysis

The EOSUSD market is also forming a triple zigzag of a larger degree.
The sub-waves [W] and [Y] are simple zigzags. The first linking wave [X]
has completed as an upward double zigzag. There is now unfolding the
second wave [X] that may conclude as a standard zigzag, composed of
three sub-waves (A)-(B)-(C). Let us see the structure of the most recent
chart section in the shorter timeframe.

It is clear that the upward wave (A) completed as a five-wave impulse.
The corrective wave (B) also looks complete. It is a double bearish
zigzag W-X-Y. The final wave (C) should be now developing. It should
complete at a level of around 4.40, which is the upward channel border.

###  **Wave analysis for[XRPUSD][13]**

 **![LiteForex: Weekly cryptocurrency forecast. Elliott wave analysis
for Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, EOS and Ripple][14]**

The [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) XRPUSD chart indicates that the market is forming the triple
down zigzag, with the sub-waves [W]-[X]-[Y] completed inside. After the
[Y] completed as a double down zigzag (W)-(X)-(Y), the second linking
wave [X] has started forming. The [X] wave should be developing as a
simple upward zigzag (A)-(B)-(C). Let us see its structure in more
detail in the shorter timeframe.

![LiteForex: Weekly cryptocurrency forecast. Elliott wave analysis for
Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, EOS and Ripple][15]

In the upward simple zigzag (A)-(B)-(C) of a larger degree, impulse wave
(A) composed of five sub-waves 1-2-3-4-5 has completed. There has also
completed the (B) correction as bear double zigzag W-X-Y. There is now
unfolding the upward impulse wave (C). The price could be following this
wave up to a level of 0.281.
