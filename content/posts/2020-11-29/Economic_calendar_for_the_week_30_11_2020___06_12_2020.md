Economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the week 30.11.2020 – 06.12.2020Jana Kane

##  **Review of the main events of the Forex economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the
next trading week (30.11.2020 – 06.12.2020)**

 **Trading on key Forex [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/): next week we are expecting the publication
of important macro statistics from China, Germany, Eurozone,
Switzerland, US, Canada, Australia, as well as the results of the
meeting of the RB of Australia.**

American stock indices rose last week, returning to the zone of absolute
highs after a correction. At the same time, the US dollar declined last
week, confirming the inverse correlation with American stock indices
that has been established in recent months. This is understandable: the
Fed is pouring almost unlimited amounts of liquidity into the financial
system, increasing the volume of purchases of stock market assets along
the way.

Last week, the DXY dollar index dropped another 0.47%, coming close to
the level of lows of more than 2 years ago, near 91.80.

Meanwhile, the growth of stock indices is also taking place against the
backdrop of optimism by market participants, which is supported by hopes
for the imminent appearance of an effective vaccine against coronavirus
and the commitment of the world's largest central banks to extra-soft
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).

Despite the alarming rate of increase in the number of coronavirus cases
in the world, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s still hope for a rapid V-shaped recovery of the
global economy and continued growth in stock markets.

Next week, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s will pay attention to the publication of important
macro statistics from China, Germany, Eurozone, Switzerland, US, Canada,
Australia and on the results of the meeting of the RB of Australia. But
their focus will probably be on the publication on Friday of monthly
data from the US labor market.

 **Traders should pay attention to the publication of the following
macro indicators:**

 ***during the coming week, new events may be added to the [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) and
/ or some scheduled events may be canceled**

 ****** **GMT time**

###  **Monday, November 30**

###  **01:00 CNY China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing (CFLP)
Manufacturing PMI**

This is an important indicator of the state of the Chinese economy as a
whole. A result above 50 is seen as positive and strengthens the CNY,
below 50 as negative for the yuan. Forecast: 51.5 in October (against
51.4 in September, 51.0 in August, 51.1 in July and 50.9 in June).

The relative growth of the index and the value of 50 should have a
positive effect on the CNY. The data above 50 indicates an increase in
activity, which has a positive effect on the quotes of the national
currency.

In the opposite case, and if the indicator is below 50, the yuan will be
under pressure and will probably decrease.

###  **01:00 CNY China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing (CFLP)
Services PMI**

This indicator assesses the state of the services sector in the Chinese
economy. A result above 50 is considered positive and strengthens the
yuan. Forecast: 52.1 in September (against 56.2 in September, 55.2 in
August, 54.2 in July and 54.4 in June).

Despite the relative decline, the indicator is still above 50, which is
likely to have a positive impact on the yuan quotes.

###  **13:00 EUR Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices  (HICP) in Germany
(preliminary release)**

This index is published by the EU Statistics Office and is calculated on
the basis of a statistical method agreed upon between all EU countries.
It is an indicator for assessing inflation and is used by the Governing
Council of the ECB to assess the level of price stability. A positive
result strengthens the EUR, a negative one weakens it.

In May, the HICP index (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) increased by +0.5%, in June by
+0.8%, in July - by 0%, in October it decreased by -0.5%. Preliminary
forecast for November: -0.5%. The euro is likely to react negatively to
the publication of this indicator. If the data turn out to be better
than the forecast, the euro may strengthen in the short term. The growth
of the indicator is a positive factor for the euro. The data suggests
that inflationary pressures are still low in Germany. The data worse
than the forecast and the previous value will negatively affect the
euro.

###  **Tuesday, December 1**

###  **03:30 AUD RBA's decision on interest rate. RBA's accompanying
statement**

In March, the RBA made 2 rate cuts bringing it to the level of 0.25%,
and launched a quantitative easing program. At the same time, for 3-year
government bonds of Australia, the target level of yield is set at
0.25%. The RBA has launched a program of lending to the banking system
in the amount of at least A$ 90 billion and intends to buy bonds for A$
5 billion.

In early November, the RB of Australia lowered its key rate again,
bringing it and the target level of 3-year bonds to 0.10% from 0.25% and
announced a quantitative easing program in the amount of A$ 100 billion
to support the country's emerging economic recovery.

The negative forecasts of economists suggest that the Australian economy
will contract by 6% in 2020, which will be the sharpest annual GDP
contraction since the Great Depression of the 1920s. The unemployment
rate is likely to rise to around 7.0-7.5%.

Some economists have talked about Australia entering its first recession
in nearly 30 years, which could turn into a depression.

“We live in extraordinary and difficult times,” said central bank
governor Philip Lowe. In his opinion, "further stimulation is needed."
He announced this during a press conference on March 19, when the RBA
cut the interest rate during its unscheduled meeting.

The main negative factors for the Australian economy are weak wages
growth, a weak labor market and a slowdown in growth. Annual inflation
has remained below the RBA's target range of 2-3% for nearly four years.

Unemployment in the country has remained above the 5% level for many
years, unwilling to decline. Now the coronavirus pandemic has been added
to the above negative factors, which has damaged the tourism and
transport sectors.

It is expected that at this meeting the Central Bank of Australia will
leave the rate at the current level of 0.1%, although unexpected
decisions are possible.

In an accompanying statement, the RBA executives will explain the
reasons for the rate decision. If the RBA signals the possibility of
further easing of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) in the near future, the risks of a
further fall in the Australian dollar will increase.

###  **06:45 CHF Switzerland GDP for Q3**

GDP is considered to be an indicator of the general state of a country's
economy and estimates the rate of its growth or decline. The Gross
Domestic Product Statement expresses in monetary [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) the aggregate
value of all final goods and services produced by Switzerland over a
given period of time. An upward trend in the GDP indicator is considered
a positive factor for the national currency (franc), while a low result
is considered negative (or bearish).

In the previous 2nd quarter of 2020, GDP declined by -8.2% (-9.3% yoy)
after declining -2.6% (-1.3% yoy) in the 1st quarter of 2020. However,
even such a strong decline cannot be compared with the fall in GDP in
Germany, the Eurozone and the United States. In the 3rd quarter of 2020,
Swiss GDP is projected to grow +5.9% (but declined by -10.8% on an
annualized basis). The data indicate a strong slowdown in the Swiss
economy, which is a negative factor for the franc.

If the data turns out to be even weaker, the franc may decline
significantly in the short term. However, one should not expect a strong
fall in the franc, as it is in active demand as a defensive asset.
Better-than-forecast data may strengthen the franc in the short term.

###  **10:00 EUR Consumer Price Index. Core Consumer Price Index
(preliminary release)**

Consumer Price Index (CPI) is published by Eurostat and measures the
price change of a selected basket of goods and services over a given
period. The index is a key indicator for assessing inflation and
changing purchasing habits. A positive result strengthens the EUR, a
negative one weakens it. In January, the CPI index increased by 1.4% (in
annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)), in February - by +1.2%, in March - by +0.7%, in April -
by +0.3%, in May - by +0.1%, and in October it fell by -0.3%, which
indicates low inflationary pressure and even a slowdown in inflation.
Forecast for November: -0.2% (annualized). If the data turns out to be
worse than forecast, the euro may fall sharply in the short term. The
data better than the forecast and/or the previous value may strengthen
the euro in the short term, despite the low value (the target level of
the ECB's consumer inflation is just below 2.0%).

Core Consumer Price Index (Core CPI) determines the change in prices of
a selected basket of goods and services for a given period and is a key
indicator for assessing inflation and changes in consumer preferences.
Food and energy have been excluded from this indicator to provide a more
accurate estimate. A high result strengthens the EUR, while a low result
weakens it. In January, Core CPI increased by 1.1% (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)), in
February - by +1.2%, in March - by +1.0%, in April and May - by +0.9%,
and in October - by +0.2%. If the data for November turn out to be worse
than the previous value or forecast, it may negatively affect the euro.
If the data turns out to be better than the forecast or the previous
value, the euro is likely to respond with an increase in quotations, but
only in the short term. Inflation in the Eurozone remains low, which is
a negative factor for the euro. Forecast for November: +0.2%.

###  **15:00 USD Speech by the Fed Chairman Jerome Powell in Congress**

The Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will speak to Congress on economics and
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). His comments could affect both short-term and long-term
USD trading if he again touches on the Fed monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). A more
hawkish stance on the Fed's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) is seen as positive and
strengthening the US dollar, while a more cautious position is seen as
negative for the USD.

If he makes unexpected statements, the volatility in trading in the
financial markets may increase. Any hints by Powell toward the need for
an even softer central bank [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) will cause the dollar to fall and
American stock markets to rise.

Financial market participants will carefully study his speech in order
to catch signals from him regarding the further actions of the Fed.

###  **15:00** **USD ISM Manufacturing PMI**

The Institute of Supply Management (ISM) Manufacturing PMI is an
important indicator of the health of the American economy as a whole. A
result above 50 is seen as positive and strengthens the USD, one below
50 as negative for the US dollar. Forecast: 57.5 in November (against
59.3 in October, 55.4 in September, 56.0 in August, 54.2 in July, 43.1
in May, 41.5 in April, 49.1 in March , 50.1 in February). The index
value is above 50 and not below the previous values, which may support
the dollar in the short term. Data above 50 indicates an acceleration in
activity, which has a positive effect on the quotes of the national
currency. If the indicator falls below the forecast and the value of 50,
the dollar may drop sharply.

###  **Wednesday, December 2**

###  **00:00 AUD Speech by the head of the RBA Philip Lowe**

In his speech, Philip Lowe will assess the current situation in the
Australian economy and point out further plans for the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
of the department. Any signals from him regarding a change in the plans
of the RBA's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) will cause a sharp increase in volatility
in the AUD trading and on the Australian stock market. If he does not
touch upon the topic of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), the market reaction to his
speech will be weak.

Market participants would also like to hear Lowe's views on central bank
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) in the face of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and the first
recession in Australia in 30 years.

In early November, the RBA's key interest rate was cut to a record level
of 0.1%, and the target level of yield on 3-year government bonds was
also lowered to 0.1%. The decision to lower the rate and set the current
target for government bond yields was made to support businesses and
Australian citizens amid the rapid spread of the coronavirus pandemic.

According to Lowe, "there are no serious arguments in favor of
tightening monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) in the short term," and "it will be some time
before interest rates rise."

###  **00:30 AUD Australia GDP (Q3)**

The Australian Bureau of Statistics report on the country's GDP, which
is the main indicator of the state of the Australian economy, for the
3rd quarter. Strong report will strengthen the AUD. Weak GDP report will
negatively affect the AUD. Forecast: + 2.5% (against -7.0% in Q2, -0.3%
in Q1 2020, +0.5% in Q4, +0.4% in Q3 2019). The growth of the indicator
is a positive factor for the AUD. If the data turns out to be worse than
the forecast, the AUD will decline.

###  **07:00 EUR Retail sales in Germany**

Retail sales are the main consumer spending indicator in Germany showing
changes in retail sales. A high result strengthens the euro, and vice
versa, a low result weakens it. Forecast: +1.0% (+6.6% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/))
in October against -2.2% (+6.5% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) in September).

The data suggests some improvement in sales indicators, but this is
unlikely to have a strong positive effect on the euro, or, most likely,
only in the short term. Better-than-expected data will also have a
positive effect on the euro in the short term.

###  **13:15 USD ADP**   **National**   **Employment Reportе**

Typically, the ADP's private sector employment report has a strong
impact on the market and dollar quotes. An increase in the value of this
indicator has a positive effect on the dollar. It is expected that the
growth in the number of workers in the private sector in the United
States in November was 420,000 (against +365,000 in October, +749,000 in
September). The growth of the indicator should have a positive effect on
the dollar quotes. Therefore, the market reaction may be positive, and
the dollar will strengthen if the data is confirmed or turns out to be
better than the forecast.

Millions of Americans have previously been laid off due to the
coronavirus pandemic and related quarantine measures. The bulk of the
layoffs were concentrated in tourism and retail. Other important sectors
of the economy were also affected. ADP previously reported that the most
significant drop in employment was recently noted in the construction
and financial services sectors.

While the ADP report does not correlate directly with official US Labor
Department data due out on Friday, it may fall short of forecasts,
pointing to a decline in non-farm jobs instead of an expected 0.520
million new job growth.

If the forecast (+0.520 million new jobs) from the US Department of
Labor does not come true, it will indicate a reversal of the current
trend in the rate of hiring, while millions of Americans lost the
previously increased unemployment benefits.

###  **Thursday, December 3**

###  **00:30 AUD Balance of trade**

This indicator measures the ratio of Australia's export and import
volumes. Growth in exports from Australia leads to an increase in the
trade surplus, which has a positive impact on the AUD. Previous value
(October) AU$ 4.840 billion. A decrease in the trade surplus may
negatively affect the Australian dollar. Vice versa, the growing trade
surplus is a positive factor for the AUD. Forecast for October: A$ 5.800
billion.

###  **10:00 EUR Retail sales in the Eurozone**

Retail sales is a major consumer spending indicator that shows the
change in retail sales. A high result strengthens the euro, and vice
versa, a low result weakens it. October forecast: +0.5% and +2.9% (YoY)
against -2.0% (+2.2% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) in September. The data suggests
that retail sales have yet to hit pre-coronavirus levels after a sharp
drop in March-April when Europe was under strict quarantine measures.

###  **15:00 USD ISM Services PMI**

This indicator assesses the state of the services sector in the US
economy. These services sectors (as opposed to the manufacturing sector)
have practically no impact on the country's GDP.

In September this indicator came out with a value of 57.8, and in
October 56.6. A result above 50 is seen as positive for the USD.
However, a relative decline in the index could negatively affect the
dollar in the short term. Forecast for November: 56.0, which is likely
to positively affect the USD in general.

###  **Friday, December 4**

###  **00:30 AUD Retail Sales Index**

Retail Sales Index is published monthly by the Australian Bureau of
Statistics and measures total retail sales. The index is often
considered an indicator of consumer confidence and reflects the health
of the retail sector in the near term. Index growth is usually positive
for the AUD; a decrease in the indicator will negatively affect the AUD.
The previous value of the index (in October) was +1.6% after falling by
-17.7% in April. If the data for November turns out to be weaker than
the previous value, the AUD may sharply decline in the short term.

###  **13:30 USD Average hourly wages. Non-Farm Payrolls. Unemployment
rate**

These are important indicators of the state of the labor market in the
US for November. Forecast: +0.1% (against +0.1% in October, -1.2% in
June, -1.0% in May, +4.7% in April) / +0.520 million (against +0.638
million in October, +1.763 million in July and -20.687 million in April)
/ 6.8% (against 6.9% in October, 13.3% in May and 14.7% in April),
respectively.

In general, the figures are not yet encouraging, but they are quite
understandable due to mass layoffs in American companies and the closure
of offices and shops due to the coronavirus pandemic. At the same time,
the data show a gradual improvement in the American labor market after
its collapse in previous months at the beginning of the year. Prior to
the coronavirus, the US labor market remained strong, signaling the
stability of the American economy and supporting the dollar.

It is often difficult to predict the market reaction to the publication
of indicators, because many indicators for previous periods may be
revised. Now it will be even more difficult to do this, because the
economic situation in many other large economies is no better. In any
case, when data from the US labor market is published, a surge in
volatility is expected in trading not only in USD, but throughout the
entire financial market. The most cautious [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s might choose to
stay out of the market during this time frame.

###  **13:30 CAD Unemployment rate in Canada**

Statistics Canada is to publish data on the country's labor market for
November.

Unemployment has risen in Canada in recent months amid massive business
closures and layoffs due to coronavirus pandemic. Unemployment rose from
the usual 5.6 - 5.7% to 7.8% in March and to 13.7% in May. If
unemployment continues to rise, the Canadian dollar will decline. If the
data is better than the previous value, the Canadian dollar will
strengthen. A decrease in the unemployment rate is a positive factor for
the CAD, an increase in unemployment is a negative factor. Unemployment
is expected to be at 8.8% in November (after 8.9%, 9.0%, 10.2%, 10.9%,
12.3%, 13.7%, 13.0% in previous months).
