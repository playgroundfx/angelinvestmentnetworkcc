Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 22.01.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

The first wave of the XRPUSD uptrend is likely to end as a leading
diagonal.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

The market has been forming the corrective wave 4 since early January.
Wave may have ended as a bearish double zigzag [W]-[X]-[Y]. The sub-
waves [W], [X], and [Y] are simple zigzags. If the presumption is
correct, and the correction has ended, the market should be rising in
the final wave 5. The first buy target is level 37850.00, which is the
previous high marked by wave (b).

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 30575.50 TP 37850.00

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

Wave (1) is unfolding as a leading diagonal, as the corrective wave 4
ended lower than wave 1. Wave 4 has a more complex structure than the
first three legs of the leading diagonal. Wave 4 is composed of the sub-
waves [W]-[X]-[Y], where wave [X] is a double zigzag. The market should
be rising in wave 5 to a level above the previous high at 0.330, made by
wave [X].

### Trading plan for **[XRPUSD][2]** today:

Buy 0.263, TP 0.330

## Elliott wave Ethereum analysis

Within the impulse wave C, the fifth leg is forming as an impulse
(1)-(2)-(3)-(4)-(5). There is now forming the final element of the
bullish wave (5), that is sub-wave 5. As the corrective wave [4] ended
at a level higher than the end of wave [1] and seems to have completed
its pattern, wave 5 must be an ending diagonal. Therefore, the market
should be rising in the final zigzag-shaped wave [5] to a level of
1450.00. One could enter purchases in the current situation.

### Trading plan for  **[ETHUSD][3] **today:

Buy 1153.30, TP 1450.00
