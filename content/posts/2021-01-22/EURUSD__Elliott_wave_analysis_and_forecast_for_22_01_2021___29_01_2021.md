EURUSD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 22.01.2021 –
29.01.2021Alex Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions above the level of 1.2110
with a target of 1.2400 – 1.2500.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
1.2110 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of 1.1971
– 1.1738.

 **Analysis:** Daily time frame: presumably, the first wave of larger
degree 1 of (3) continues developing, with wave v of 1 forming inside.
On the H4 time frame, the third wave of smaller degree (iii) of v
finished forming, and a descending correction developed as the fourth
wave (iv) of v, presumably. Apparently, the fifth wave (v) of v started
to develop on the H1 time frame. If this assumption is correct, the pair
will continue to rise to 1.2400 – 1.2500. The level of 1.2110 is
critical in this scenario. Its breakout will allow the pair to continue
falling to the levels of 1.1971 – 1.1738.
