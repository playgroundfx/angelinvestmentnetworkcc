Medium-term forecast for oil, gold, and EURUSD 22.01.2021Alex Rodionov

I welcome my colleagues! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest trading
signals for traders who trade in medium-term trends.

This week the gold price broke the accumulation [1859 - 1816] zone
upside.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for next week: USCrude analysis

This week, oil is trading in a range between the high and the low of
last week. This indicates the formation of a medium-term accumulation
zone. For further growth, it is necessary to break out the Target Zone 4
level [54.72 - 54.21] and consolidate higher.

To work in the correction, a breakout of level 51.88 is required. In
this case, correction's target will be the trend key support [49.39 -
48.94].

For the next week, wait for the price to stop trading flat, and work
either for selling or buying, depending on where the price will move.

### [USCrude][1] Trading tips for the upcoming week:

If the price breaks out the level 51.88, sell. TakeProfit: Target Zone
[49.39 - 48.94]. StopLoss: above the nearest significant high.

## Gold price forecast for next week: XAUUSD analysis

This week the gold price broke the accumulation [1859 - 1816] zone
upside. Last week, I recommended looking for purchases in this area
according to the pattern.

Gold medium-term trend remains up. The growth target is to break through
January's high and test Target Zone 2 [2005.8 - 1994.3].

For the next week, hold purchases opened in the area [1859 - 1816] and
look for new ones on the zone retest from top to bottom. For new
purchases,  wait for the Price Action pattern.

An alternative scenario implies a return to the accumulation zone and a
breakout of support at 1816.

### [XAUUSD][2] Trading tips for the upcoming week:

  1. Hold up purchases entered in the zone of [1859 - 1816]. Target Zone 2 [2005.8 - 1994.3]. StopLoss: at breakeven.

  2. Open new purchases according to the pattern from the level of 1859. TakeProfit: Target Zone 2 [2005.8 - 1994.3]. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Euro/dollar price forecast for next week: EURUSD analysis

From the end of last to the beginning of this week, EURUSD pair medium-
term trend reversed down. The Target Zone [1.2165 - 1.2146] was broken
out. After that, the price went into correction with the target in the
new trend's key resistance [1.2229 - 1.2213].

Next week, wait for a test of the trend key resistance area and look for
a sell pattern with a target at the low of the week + Target Zone 2
[1.1981 - 1.1962].

A sell signal for the euro can also be formed in the resistance area
[1.2165-1.2146], but it is not there at the moment.

### [EURUSD][3] Trading tips for the upcoming week:

Sell according to the pattern in the zone of [1.2146 - 1.2229].
TakeProfit: 1.2055, Target Zone 2 [1.1981 - 1.1962]. StopLoss: according
to the pattern rules.
