Euro has a compass. Forecast as of 22.01.2021Dmitri Demidenko

If you do not want to lose being in a losing position, you should create
confusion. It is difficult to discourage [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s who are willing to
buy the [EURUSD][1]. The best way to press down the euro is to address
uncertainty. Let us discuss the Forex outlook and make up a trading
plan.

## Weekly euro fundamental forecast

Christine Lagarde failed to drop the euro, but she didn’t let the single
European currency grow, which could be recognized as the ECB success
under the current conditions. Although the Governing Council admitted
that concerns about the rapid strengthening of the euro have eased, and
the euro-area bond yields increased, the [EURUSD][1] bulls failed to
draw the price above figure 22 bottom. The reason is the confusion
created by Lagarde.

What is good, what is bad. At a press conference shortly after the
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) announcement, Lagarde spoke about both positive and negative
aspects of the development of the world and European economies. As
positive sides, Lagarde enumerated the beginning of vaccination, the
Brexit deal, the European Rescue Fund, a decrease in political
uncertainty in the United States, and the success of the euro-area
manufacturing. The negative points are the pandemic and lockdowns in the
euro-area countries, the likely double-dip recession, and stubbornly low
inflation.

The Governing Council stands ready to adjust the pandemic asset purchase
program but doesn’t say how exactly. Most of the uncertainty must result
from Christine Lagarde's announcement that PEPP will be scaled up or
down based on market data, including [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) and conditions of bank
lending and sovereign and corporate bond rates. It would seem that the
ECB suggests yield targeting following the example of the central banks
of Japan and Australia. Still, unlike them, the ECB uses not one but
several criteria. The central bank doesn’t explain how exactly it should
adjust its asset purchases. The market is confused, which is
traditionally supports safe-haven assets. That is why the [EURUSD][1]
could not rise high.

Christine Lagarde noted that financial conditions are the compass, and
inflation is the anchor. At the same time, the fact that the ECB asset
purchases under the PEPP are scaling down supports the euro.

### Dynamics of ECB asset purchases

ECB has given way to the Fed, whose meeting will highlight the last week
of January. The Federal Reserve must be satisfied with the increase of
inflation expectations suggested by different market indicators,
including bond breakeven inflation rates, interest rate swaps, and
hedging costs. But isn’t it an illusion? According to the Baupost Group,
the US central bank and government have convinced [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s that the
risk has simply disappeared. As a result, the market cannot fulfill its
function of determining prices. __

### Dynamics of US inflation expectations

In fact, the growth of the US stock indexes during the COVID-19 pandemic
and GDP downturn is not natural. The higher the [S&P 500][2] grow, the
more likely the correction is to start. If the US equities go down, the
euro will be pressed down.

### Weekly [EURUSD][1] trading plan

If the euro-area PMI data are strong in January, it will signal that the
euro-area economy has adopted to the pandemic. In this case, the
[EURUSD][1] could rise above 1.22. Hold up the longs entered at [1.208
and 1.2125][3], but prepare for the violent price swings. As I noted
earlier, the euro rally won’t be easy.
