Forex: who will drown faster? Review as of 22.01.2021Dmitri Demidenko

While the [S&P 500][1] is treated to carrot, the USD gets stick.

## In the global market, currencies don't float. They drown

If you put a frog into the water and gradually raise the temperature, it
won't notice it's being boiled. The Fed and Congress used enormous
permanent monetary and fiscal stimuli to make [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s forget about
danger. The markets are no longer afraid; it's Greed that is ruling
them. The US employment rates are falling, retail sales are diving, GDP
is slowing down, the COVID-19 death toll is near historic highs, and the
[S&P 500][1] is growing by leaps and bounds. So, why isn't the USD, the
main Forex safe-haven asset, continuing to collapse? Did it find
something to catch at?

If you're lost in a forest and don't know where to go, go home! The
Central Bank's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) and fiscal stimulus convinced [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s
that risk had vanished. As a result, the market lost one of its
[functions](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/basic-functions/): the pricing one. Donald Trump regarded the [S&P 500][1]'s
rally as the leading indicator of his successful policies. Can we then
say that the index's 75% rise from March's bottom level means the 45th
US president's activities were efficient? Why did he lose the election,
then?

When the amount of stimulus is that big, it's hardly possible to
evaluate the economy's state based on market indicators. It's like
trying to measure one’s temperature after taking a big dose of aspirin.
I wonder how the [S&P 500][1] would react to [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) about the US economy’s
double recession in the first quarter. Would it continue growing?

In these circumstances, the Fed's decision not to take any action and
not even think about raising rates looks reasonable. If the market went
blind, what's the point in being guided by its growing inflation
expectations? Wouldn't it be better to wait for real statistics? The
Central Bank behaves like a witch: first, it has bewitched the beauty,
and now it's waiting for someone to wake her up with a kiss.
Unsurprisingly, what was called the witches' sabbath in the Middle Age
is called the FOMC meeting nowadays.

The [S&P 500][1] bears are pointing to growing borrowing costs,
potentially awful corporate reports, and extremely high fundamental
estimates, seeing them as correction signals. However, they look far-
fetched. In the meanwhile, their opponents are treated to relief
measures. Another one is on the way, and it's worth $1.9 trillion. It's
hard to find a black cat in a black room if valerian is served next
door. Are stock indexes doomed to growth?

So, what shall we do with the US dollar?

> \- Excuse me, could I have some more carrot?

>

> \- Eat up your stick first!

What floats US stocks' boat sinks the greenback's one. The global risk
appetite's growth is a stick for safe-haven assets. And the USD index
stopped falling in January not because the USD smelt a carrot, but
because currencies don't float in Forex. They drown. Slow vaccination
and double recession in Europe put the kibosh on the [EURUSD][2] bulls.
Only a coma will save us from crises. Will this world ever come back to
normal?
