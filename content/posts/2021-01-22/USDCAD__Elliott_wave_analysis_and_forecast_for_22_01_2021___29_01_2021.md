USDCAD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 22.01.2021 –
29.01.2021Alex Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 1.2797 with a target of 1.2450 – 1.2300.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
1.2797 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 1.2991 –
1.3174.

 **Analysis:** Wave (С) of 4 of larger degree continues developing on
the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame, with the first wave 1 of (C) forming inside.
Presumably, the fifth wave v of 1 of (C) is forming on the H4 time
frame. Wave (iii) of v of smaller degree has formed and correction
completed in the form of wave (iv) of v as part of the fifth wave v of 1
of (C). Apparently, the fifth wave (v) of v is developing on the H1 time
frame. If this assumption is correct, the pair will continue to fall to
1.2450 – 1.2300. The level of 1.2797 is critical in this scenario, as
the breakout will enable the pair to continue rising to the levels of
1.2991 – 1.3174.
