For Pound the sky is the limit. Forecast as of 17.02.2021Dmitri
Demidenko

Vaccinations, the opening of economies after lockdowns, and their rapid
growth continue to be the main topics at Forex. These events help the
[GBPUSD][1] bulls, who have a second wind, despite all the negative
factors. Let us discuss the Forex outlook and make up a trading plan.

## Weekly pound fundamental forecast

Only a rapid rally in the yield of US Treasury bonds managed to cool the
[GBPUSD][1] bulls' eagerness. The pair came very close to the
psychologically important level of 1.4. As I wrote back in
[December][2], pound bulls pay no attention to the worst recession in
the British economy over the past 300 years, the BoE's call for banks to
prepare to lower the interest rate below zero, or the friction with the
EU over specific provisions of the Brexit agreement. The pound is rising
thanks to the V-shaped vaccine trade, and until traders lose faith in
it, it will be very difficult to stop.

The pandemic has had a huge negative impact on the UK. About 4 million
infected, more than 120 thousand deaths, and economic recession by 9.9%
in 2020. It is the worst result among the G7 countries (for comparison,
Italy's GDP sank by 8.8%, France's - by 8.3%, Germany's - by 5 %, USA's
- by 3.5%). It is not surprising that Boris Johnson's administration is
actively facilitating vaccination. As of February 16, 16.1 million
people had been inoculated, which is equivalent to 24.1% of the UK
population. Even in the US, the vaccination rate is slower (17.1%), not
to mention the European Union (5.1%). At the same time, a study by
Maccabi Healthcare Services convinces the effectiveness of Pfizer's
products. Of the 523,000 Israelis who received two injections, 544 were
infected with COVID-19, 15 were hospitalized, 4 with severe symptoms and
none died.

The pandemic can only be stopped by vaccination. The fact that 65-70% of
the British population will be vaccinated by the summer works in
sterling's favor. At the current vaccination rate (about 6.4 million
doses per day), it will take the world 4.9 years to reach UK's figures.
Pantheon Macroeconomics expects significant UK GDP growth in the second
and third quarters by 6% and 2.2%, respectively. I believe this optimism
is typical not only for experts and [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s but also for British
companies. In this regard, the release of data on business activity can
trigger the [GBPUSD][1] growth. The consensus forecast assumes an
increase in the UK services PMI from 39.5 to 41 and a decrease in the
country's manufacturing PMI sector from 54.1 to 53.2 in February.
However, in my opinion, the actual data will exceed the estimates, which
will allow the pound to resume the rally.

I don't think the Bank of England was seriously talking about lowering
the interest rate below zero. The BoE also expects that the economy and
inflation will accelerate in April-September. Under such conditions, it
is unreasonable to talk about an easing of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) unless you're
going to play currency wars.

### Weekly [GBPUSD][1] trading plan

Expectations drive markets, and the fact that [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s prefer to forget
the terrible past and are optimistic about the future explains the
impressive start of [GBPUSD][1] in 2021. In my opinion, the level of 1.4
will not be able to stop the bulls. Set more serious targets at 1.42 and
1.44. The strategy remains the same - buying on corrections. It could
make sense to enter new longs or add up to the existing ones if the
minutes of the Fed’s meeting sound dovish and the UK PMI in February is
strong.
