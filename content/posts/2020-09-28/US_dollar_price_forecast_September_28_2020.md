Dollar doesn’t care for anything. Forecast for 28.09.2020Dmitri
Demidenko

The greenback doesn’t react to the bearish forecasts. Investors are now
focused on the US presidential election. Let us monitor the approval
ratings and polls to make a [EURUSD][1] trading plan.

## Weekly fundamental US dollar forecast

The dollar is strong despite the gloomy forecasts. In summer, when the
epidemiological situation in the US was deteriorating, and the stock
market was rising, Forex analysts suggested the greenback has lost its
status of the primary reserve currency. The USD was expected to drop by
30% and more, as it was in the 1970s and 1980s. The share of the US
dollar in the central banks’ FX reserves, international settlements, and
cross-border lending should have declined. In late September, it became
clear that the forecasts do not meet reality.

The week through September 25 has become the best for the USD since
April. The second COVID-19 wave in Europe and the drop of the US stock
market sent the [EURUSD][1] pair to the bottom of figure 16. Uncertainty
and disappointment are back in Forex. The greenback usually strengthens
under such conditions. In August, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s were selling off the dollar
because of the divergence in the economic expansion of the US and the
euro-area. In autumn, this idea stopped working. The [S&P 500][2]
correction also weighs on the euro.

The market turmoil also results form the US upcoming election. After
Donald Trump abandoned the peaceful transfer of power, referring to
possible [fraud](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/cryptocurrency-fraud/)ulent mail-order voting, the baseline scenario for the
markets has been unclear. According to USB, once the voting result is
known, it will have a significant, but not excessive, impact on the
market. Investors do not know [how to](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-trading-how-to/) react to the possibility that the
situation will turn into complete chaos. The [S&P 500][2] is sliding
down, the Forex volatility is growing along with the USD rate, and the
majority is betting on the sharp moves of the assets. Moreover, the
focus is on those currencies that didn’t previously react to the US
presidential election. For example, the Russian ruble could crash if Joe
Biden becomes the president. In this case, there might be additional
sanctions against Russia.

presidential election and the S&P dynamics

According to the Survation poll of the asset managers managing $3
trillion, 60% of respondents believe Joe Biden will win the election on
November 4. 48.3% of investment specialists suggest that Republicans
will maintain control of the Senate. 43% expect that Democrats will take
control of the Senate. 88.5% of those polled believe that Democrats will
continue to dominate the House of Representatives. 60% of asset managers
say the US stock indexes will enter a bear market if Democrats win on
all three fronts. 15% of the respondents suggest the victory of
Democrats will support the rally of the US stock market.

### Weekly trading plan for [EURUSD][1]

Joe Biden is currently the leader, according to polls. However, things
are not going on according to the plan. The greenback isn’t falling
despite the rule “what is good for Donald Trump is good for the dollar.”
It is risky to buy the [EURUSD][1] as the uptrend could break if the
second pandemic wave in Europe is more severe than the first one. I
suggest expecting the bars of the breakouts of the supports at
1.158-1.16 and 1.149-1.151 to close and putting pending orders at the
highs of these bars.
