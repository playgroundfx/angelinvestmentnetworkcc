Medium-term forecast for five cryptocurrencies as of 28.09.2020Roman
Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a medium-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, EOS, and Ripple. I offer
trading signals for each cryptocurrency pair.

Almost all cryptocurrency pairs are forming the upward corrective waves
that haven’t yet finished. The could be corrective price rises during
this week. Read the detailed trading recommendations below.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

 ****

The [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) BTCUSD price chart displays the corrective wave 4, which has
started after the bullish impulse 3 completed. Wave 4 must be unfolding
as a double zigzag. The first part of this double zigzag, the sub-wave
[W], ended with the sub-waves (A)-(B)-(C) competed within. The market is
now rising in the linking wave [X] that also could be a double zigzag
(W)-(X)-(Y). Let us see the most recent wave on the eight-hour
timeframe.

The upward wave (Y) is unfolding as a standard zigzag A-B-C. The upward
impulse wave A has lately completed; it is composed of five sub-waves
[1]-[2]-[3]-[4]-[5]. The market is now running down in the corrective
wave B that is unfolding as a bear double zigzag [W]-[X]-[Y]. The
linking wave [X] should complete at a level of 11480. Next, the market
will resume declining in the corrective wave (Y) to a level of around
8160, as it is outlined in the chart.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] for the week

Buy 10900.00, TP 11480.00

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

 ****

The ETHUSD market continues to form a large linking wave [X] that is an
element of the global triple zigzag. The [X] wave started in late 2018.
It is unfolding as a triple combination of zigzags (W)-(X)-(Y)-(X)-(Z).
The first three elements of this pattern have completed. There is now
developing the linking down wave (X) that is composed of A-B-C. Let us
see the structure of these waves in the shorter timeframe.

After the upward wave (Y) finished, the market started running down and
formed the first sub-waves of the linking wave (X), which is impulse A.
Next, the price started rising in the corrective wave B. The market is
now forming the beginning of the final impulse wave C, with the sub-wave
[1] completed inside. An approximate trajectory of the Future Ethereum
price is outlined in the chart.

### Trading plan **[ETHUSD][2]** for the week

Buy 358.98, TP 367.31

##  **Elliott wave Litecoin** **analysis**

 ****

Like in the previous week, the Litecoin market is following the
corrective wave B that is unfolding as a triple zigzag that is composed
of the sub-waves [W]-[X]-[Y]-[X]-[Z]. The [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) chart displays the final
leg of this zigzag. The linking upward wave [X] has completed. The
market is now declining in wave [Z]. The [Z] wave must conclude as a
simple zigzag (A)-(B)-(C). Let us study its structure in more detail in
the eight-hour timeframe.

The LTCUSD chart displays the final leg of the impulse wave (A) and the
structure of the entire corrective wave (B), which is a zigzag A-B-C.
There is now forming the bear wave (C) as an impulse. The first three
legs of this impulse have completed. There is now forming correction 4
that is composed of the sub-waves [w]-[x]-[y]. This correction should
soon complete, and the market should start declining in wave 5 to a
level of around 25.00 that is the previous low.

### Trading plan for **[LTCUSD][3]**  for the week

Sell 46.53, TP 25.00

##  **Elliott wave EOS analysis**

 ****

The EOSUSD market is following the global corrective wave B as a triple
zigzag. It is composed of five sub-waves [W]-[X]-[Y]-[X]-[Z]. The sub-
waves [W], [Y], and [X] are simple zigzags. The first linking wave [X]
has completed as a bullish double zigzag. The price is now declining in
the down wave [Z] that is unfolding as a zigzag (A)-(B)-(C). Let us see
its structure in more detail in the eight-hour timeframe.

The impulse wave (A) has completed within the [Z] wave. Wave (B) is
still developing. The price could be rising in impulse C of (B) to a
level of 2.93. Next, the market will resume running down in the impulse
wave (C) towards the previous low created by the zigzag-shaped wave [Y],
level 1.40.

### Trading plan for **[EOSUSD][4]** for the week

Buy 2.58, TP 2.93

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

The XRPUSD market is following the triple down zigzag. The sub-waves
[W], [X] and [X] are simple zigzags. Wave [Y] has completed as a bear
double zigzag (W)-(X)-(Y). The final wave [Z} is yet developing. It
should conclude as a double zigzag, like the [Y] wave. Let us see the
most recent section of the Ripple chart on the eight-hour timeframe.

After the down wave (W) finished as a zigzag A-B-C, the market has
started rising in the linking wave (X). The (X) wave could end at a
level of around 0.366, where the (X) will reach 50% Fibonacci level of
the (W) zigzag. Next, when the price reaches the above-indicated level,
it could start declining in wave (Y) to the previous low made by the [Y]
wave, level 0.110.

### Trading plan for **[XRPUSD][5]** for the week

Buy 0.243, TP 0.266
