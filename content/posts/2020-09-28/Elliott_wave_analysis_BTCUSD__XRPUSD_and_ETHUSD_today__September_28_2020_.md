Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 28.09.2020Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I suggest entry signals
to trade each cryptocurrency.

All cryptocurrency pairs should conclude corrective waves in the near
future. Next, there should start downtrends. One could yet enter long
trades until the downtrend starts.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

 ****

The BTCUSD market continues forming a large down corrective wave B as a
double zigzag [W]-[X]-[Y]. The final wave [Y] is currently unfolding. It
is likely to conclude as a simple zigzag (A)-(B)-(C). The final impulse
c of (B) should end at a level of 11058. Next, the market should go down
in the impulse wave (C) that may conclude the double zigzag currently
unfolding.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 10874.00, TP 11058.00

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

 ****

There is forming the downtrend that has started after the bullish
linking wave [X] completed. The new trend must be unfolding as a double
zigzag (W)-(X)-(Y). The first two elements of this double combination
have completed, and there is unfolding the final wave [Y] that is
composed of three main sub-waves A-B-C. The B correction could end at a
level of 0.250. Next, the market should turn down and start declining,
as it is outlined in the chart.

### Trading plan for **[XRPUSD][2]** today

Buy 0.244, TP 0.250

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

 ****

There is also developing the downtrend. After the upward wave (Y)
completed, there has started forming a new zigzag A-B-C. The impulse
wave A and the triple zigzag B seem complete. The market is now
declining in the new downtrend. Most likely, the corrective price
movement in the sub wave [2] should end at a level of around 367.31.
Next, the price should turn down and decline.

### Trading plan  **[ETHUSD][3] **today

Buy 357.27, TP 367.31
