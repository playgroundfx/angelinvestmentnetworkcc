Gold could break the bottom. Forecast as of 28.09.2020Dmitri Demidenko

It seems that the gold price has reached its bottom; however, it may
continue declining. Will the gold fall deeper? We shall discuss the gold
outlook and make a [XAUUSD][1] trading plan.

## Weekly fundamental gold price forecast

Investors again buy the US dollar; the inflation expectations go down,
the [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/) traders stay passive, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are disappointed with the gold
performance in the risk hedging area. These reasons sent the [XAUUSD][1]
to its two-month low. The winner has turned into a loser. It is a common
situation in the financial markets. As I expected in [early
September][2], the gold price dropped to $1865 per ounce. However,
should we enter longs right now?

If you consider buying gold now, you should take into account four
factors: the US dollar, the Treasury real yield, the [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/) holdings, and
the global risk appetite. The precious metal is considered to be a safe-
haven asset, so the rise in the FX volatility used to support the
[XAUUSD][1] growth in the past. The situation is different in 2020.
According to JP Morgan, purchases of gold and yen against the greenback,
as well as buying the franc against the euro, amid a drop in the global
risk appetite, are now yielding the least return over the past decade.
It is better to buy the yen versus a basket of currencies and (or) enter
the US longs versus emerging markets’ currencies.

In my opinion, the US dollar outperforms gold as a safe haven, also
because of the sharp cut in the federal funds rate that has driven the
investment world into the era of the ultra-low bond yields. The
stability of real yields in the US bond market has discouraged the
[XAUUSD][1] bulls. The real yields will continue falling if the
inflation expectations increase. The inflation expectations, however,
are down to the lowest level since early August.

According to Commerzbank, a sharper drop in the gold price in late
September than previously expected results from the Forex trends. In
late spring and early summer, the market was enthusiastic about US
dollar selloffs. However, the second COVID-19 wave in Europe, the ECB
verbal interventions, and the [S&P 500][3] correction encouraged
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s to exit the USD shorts. So, the USD has been up to the two-
month high.

Initially, buying gold in the zone of $1850-$1865 looked wise amid the
most significant [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) capital inflow into gold [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/)s on September 21.
However, the indicator resented mixed dynamics later. According to Amro
Bank, traders took a break. However, if the [XAUUSD][1] continues
falling, the gold [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/) should reduce their holdings.

### Weekly gold trading plan

I believe the [XAUUSD][1] bulls will be held back until the US dollar
shows weakness, and the inflation expectations start rising. Uncertainty
around the upcoming US presidential election supports the dollar; it
could continue after the elections. Therefore, the gold price could drop
to $1815-$1820or even to $1770. In the meanwhile, we shall wait and see.
It will be relevant to consider entering gold longs when the price goes
back above $1875.
