Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 19.01.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

All three cryptocurrency pairs are following the suggested scenarios.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

The BTCUSD market is forming an upward impulse wave [5] that should end
soon. There is currently developing the initial element of the bullish
impulse (5), sub-wave 5. Wave 5 has started unfolding after wave 4
completed as a flat composed of the sub-waves [a]-[b]-[c]. Therefore,
the Bitcoin price should be growing toward a level of 50000.00. I
recommend entering purchases in the current situation.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 36568.50 TP 50000.00

* * *

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

The XRPUSD market has started forming the upward impulse wave. There is
now forming the first leg (1) of the up wave of a larger degree. Wave
(1) is unfolding as a five-wave impulse composed of the sub-waves
1-2-3-4-5. The market must have completed forming the flat corrective
wave 4 as a triangle, and there is now forming the upward wave 5. The
Ripple price should reach level 0.380. One could enter long trades in
the current situation.

### Trading plan for **[XRPUSD][2]** today:

Buy 0.288, TP 0.380

## Elliott wave Ethereum analysis

There is forming the upward impulse wave [5] that should conclude the
bullish impulse C of a larger degree. Wave (5), the fifth leg of the
wave [5], is currently unfolding. Waves 1-2-3-4 of this impulse must
have completed, and wave 5 is about to end soon. The price should be
rising in the sub-wave [5] to a level of 1450.00. One could enter
purchases with a target at 1450.00.

### Trading plan for  **[ETHUSD][3] **today:

Buy 1315.71, TP 1450.00
