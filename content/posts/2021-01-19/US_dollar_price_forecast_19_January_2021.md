Dollar is dressed for the season. Forecast as of 19.01.2021Dmitri
Demidenko

Janet Yellen’s speech to Congress and Joe Biden’s inauguration could
give a new impetus to the EURUSD and determine the future trend. Let us
discuss the Forex outlook and make up a [EURUSD][1] trading plan.

## Weekly US dollar fundamental forecast

When making investment decisions, traders often use patterns –
regularities that occur in the past and are likely to work in the
future. What should you do if the patterns indicate opposite directions
for a future asset price? Should you avoid trading at all or choose one
pattern and ignore another one? Will the [EURUSD][1] be trading
according to the seasonal factor or the [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) market? Should you enter
a trade now or wait for a better time?

I offer a statistical analysis with a fundamental element in the
LiteForex blog at the end of each month. I explore the seasonal pattern
of G10 currencies' trends. In [December][2], I noted that January was a
favorable period for the US dollar. For example, the [EURUSD][1] closed
in the red zone in 29 cases out of 45 in January 1975-2020. Nordea
Markets notes that after the US President's inauguration, starting in
1974, the euro or its analog fell against the greenback in 9 cases out
of 12. Before the inauguration, there are usually many talks about the
stimulus; traders buy risky currencies on the rumor and, next, sell them
on the fact.

The seasonal factor signals the euro correction to continue, which is
confirmed by excessive US dollar shorts in the derivatives market. In
the week ended January 12, hedge funds boosted the dollar shorts to the
highest level since March 2018. A lot could have changed until January
18, when the [EURUSD][1] dropped to the middle of figure 20.

On the other hand, the USD net shorts were around all-time highs for a
long time in the 2000s. And the USD was falling then. Besides, another
pattern, the [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) market indicators signal the [EURUSD][1] correction
to end soon. The difference between yearly and monthly dollar risk
reversals is again negative, which has always resulted in the USD drop
since September.

Janet Yellen's commitment to a strong dollar [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) can hardly be used
as a trading pattern. Since 1995, the American administrations have
consistently adhered to a strong dollar. However, before Donald Trump,
nobody publicly spoke about the benefits of a weak door. According to
the Wall Street Journal insider, the new Treasury Secretary will say
that the markets should determine the greenback's value relative to
other currencies. According to the Australia & New Zealand Banking
Group, this phrase means that the White House may be aiming at the
dollar weakening.

### Weekly [EURUSD][1] trading plan

Janet Yellen’s speech to the Congress in an attempt to pass a $1.9
trillion stimulus package and Joe Biden’s inauguration are just events,
which should confirm a trading pattern. If the [EURUSD][1] goes down
below 1.205, the correction should run deeper. If the bulls hold the
price above 1.208, the uptrend could recover. However, the euro’s rally
won’t be easy.
