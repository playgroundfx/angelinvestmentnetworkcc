Economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the week 01.03.2021 – 07.03.2021Jana Kane

##  **Review of the main events of the Forex economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the
next trading week (01.03.2021 – 07.03.2021)**

 **Trading on key Forex [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/): next week we are expecting the publication
of important macro statistics from the US, Germany, Eurozone, Australia,
the results of the meeting of the Central Bank of Australia, as well as
the publication of monthly data from the American labor market.**

American stock indices closed last week with a decline. Despite the
continued optimism and persuasion from the Fed leaders, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s and
stock indices seem to have decided to take a break before storming new
record levels.

Supported by growing yields on US government bonds, the dollar rose last
week despite extreme volatility caused by Jerome Powell's statements
(the DXY dollar index rose 0.5% over the past week).

The Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said in his speech in Congress that the
central bank would continue to pursue soft policies until significant
progress is made towards meeting its inflation and employment targets.
In his opinion, it may take more than three years to achieve the target
inflation rate of 2%, and during this time the Fed intends to maintain
the parameters of the current monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).

Powell's statements indicate that he is not worried about rising
government bond yields and heightened inflation expectations, and the
central bank will allow inflation to even exceed the 2% target for a
while before discussing [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) tightening (annual inflation at the end
of 2020 was 1.3%, staying below the Fed's target for the eighth
consecutive year).

Next week, financial market participants will pay attention to the
publication of important macro statistics from the US, Germany,
Eurozone, and Australia. However, their focus will be on the Australian
central bank meeting, as well as the release on Friday of the monthly US
labor market data, which is crucial (along with inflation and GDP data)
for the Fed in making monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) decisions.

 **Traders should pay attention to the publication of the following
macro indicators:**

 ***during the coming week, new events may be added to the [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) and
/ or some scheduled events may be canceled**

 ****GMT time**

###  **Monday, March** **1**

###  **13:00 EUR Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) in Germany
(preliminary release)**

This index is published by the EU Statistics Office and is calculated on
the basis of a statistical method agreed between all EU countries. It is
an indicator for assessing inflation used by the Governing Council of
the ECB to assess the level of price stability. A positive result
strengthens the EUR, a negative one weakens it. Preliminary forecast for
February: +1.6% (against +1.6% in January, -0.7% in December and
negative values ​​in the second half of 2020) in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/). If the
data turn out to be better than the forecast, the euro may strengthen in
the short term. The growth of the indicator is a positive factor for the
euro. The data suggests that inflationary pressures are still low in
Germany. The data is worse than the forecast and the previous value will
negatively affect the euro.

###  **15:00 USD Manufacturing PMI from ISM**

ISM Manufacturing PMI is an important indicator of the health of the
American economy as a whole. A result above 50 is seen as positive and
strengthens the USD, one below 50 as negative for the US dollar.
Forecast: 58.9 in February (against 58.7 in January, 60.7 in December).
The index value is above the 50 level, which may support the dollar in
the short term. The data above 50 indicates an acceleration of activity,
which has a positive effect on the quotes of the national currency. If
the indicator falls below the forecast and especially below the value of
50, the dollar may fall sharply.

###  **16:10 EUR Speech by head of the ECB Christine Lagarde**

During the speech of the head of the ECB Christine Lagarde, the
volatility can increase not only in the euro and European stock indices,
but also throughout the financial market, especially if she touches on
the topic of the ECB's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). Any hints at curtailing the QE
program in the Eurozone will cause the euro to rise. The soft tone of
Christine Lagarde's speech and the propensity to continue the extra soft
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the ECB will negatively affect the euro.

Speeches by the head of the ECB after the bank's meetings have a
particularly strong influence on the market. In previous periods, the
speech of the head of the ECB in similar situations could cause a change
in the euro rate by more than 3%. If Christine Lagarde does not touch
upon the topic of the ECB's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), the reaction to her speech
will be weak.

###  **Tuesday, March 2**

###  **03:30 AUD RBA's decision on interest rate. RBA's accompanying
statement**

In March 2020, the RBA made 2 rate cuts, bringing it to the level of
0.25%, and launched a quantitative easing program. At the same time, the
target level of yield for 3-year government bonds of Australia is set at
0.25%. The RBA has launched a program of lending to the banking system
in the amount of at least A$ 90 billion and intends to buy bonds for A$
5 billion.

In early November 2020, the RB of Australia lowered its key rate again,
bringing it and the target level of 3-year bonds to 0.10% from 0.25% and
announced a quantitative easing program in the amount of A$ 100 billion
to support the economic recovery of the country.

“We live in extraordinary and difficult times,” said central bank
governor Philip Lowe. In his opinion, "further stimulation is needed."
He stated this during a press conference on March 19, 2020, when the RBA
lowered the interest rate during its unscheduled meeting.

The main negative factors for the Australian economy are weak wages
growth, a weak labor market and a slowdown in growth. Annual inflation
has remained below the RBA's target range of 2-3% for four years.

Unemployment in the country remains above the 5% level for many years,
unwilling to decline. Now the Australian economy is experiencing
difficulties due to the coronavirus pandemic, which has hit the tourism
and transport sectors.

It is expected that at this meeting the Central Bank of Australia will
leave the rate at the current level of 0.1%, although unexpected
decisions are possible.

In an accompanying statement, the RBA leaders will explain the reasons
for the rate decision. If the RBA signals the possibility of further
easing of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) in the near future, the risks of a further
fall in the Australian dollar will increase.

###  **07:00 EUR Retail sales in Germany**

Retail sales are the main consumer spending indicator in Germany showing
changes in retail sales. A high result strengthens the euro, and vice
versa, a low result weakens it. Forecast: -0.5% in January (+5% in
annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) against -9.6% (+1.5% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) in December, +1.9%
(+5.6% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) ) in November.

The data indicate a new decline in the indicator due to new lockdowns
due to the coronavirus. The data release is unlikely to have a positive
impact on the euro. Better-than-expected data is likely to have a
positive effect on the euro, but only in the short term.

###  **10:00 EUR Consumer Price Index. Core Consumer Price Index
(preliminary release)**

Consumer Price Index (CPI) is published by Eurostat and measures the
price change of a selected basket of goods and services over a given
period. The index is a key indicator for assessing inflation and
changing purchasing habits. A positive result strengthens the EUR, a
negative one weakens it. In October, November and December 2020, CPI
fell by -0.3%, indicating low inflationary pressures and even slowing
inflation. Forecast for February: +1.0% (annualized) against +0.9% in
January. If the data turn out to be worse than forecast, the euro may
fall sharply in the short term. The data better than the forecast and /
or the previous value may strengthen the euro in the short-term, despite
the low value (the target level of the ECB's consumer inflation is just
below 2.0%).

Core Consumer Price Index (Core CPI) determines the change in prices of
a selected basket of goods and services for a given period and is a key
indicator for assessing inflation and changes in consumer preferences.
Food and energy have been excluded from this indicator to provide a more
accurate estimate. A high result strengthens the EUR, while a low result
weakens it. In January 2021, Core CPI rose by +1.4% (YoY) after more
modest values ​​of +0.2% between September and December 2020. If the
data for February turn out to be worse than the previous value or
forecast, this may negatively affect the euro. If the data turn out to
be better than the forecast or the previous value, the euro is likely to
respond with an increase in quotations, but only in the short term.
Inflation in the Eurozone remains low, which is a negative factor for
the euro. Forecast for February: +1.1%.

###  **13:30 CAD Canada GDP. Annual data**

Canada's GDP report is published by Statistics Canada. A strong report
will strengthen the CAD. A weak GDP report will negatively affect the
CAD. The previous report pointed to the growth of GDP in Canada by 0.7%
in November.

Canada's Quarterly GDP report reflects the total volume of all goods and
services produced by Canada for the quarter (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) and is
considered an indicator of the general health of the Canadian economy.
In the previous (third) quarter, GDP grew by 40.5%. If the data for Q4
2020 turns out to be stronger, the CAD will strengthen.

Forecast: +0.4% in December and +47.6% in the 4th quarter. This is
positive data for the CAD.

###  **Wednesday, March 3**

###  **00:30 AUD Australia GDP (Q4)**

Australian Bureau of Statistics report on the country's GDP, which is
the main indicator of the state of the Australian economy. Strong report
will strengthen the AUD. A weak GDP report will negatively affect the
AUD. Forecast: +2.5% (against + 3.3% in Q3, -7.0% in Q2, -0.3% in Q1
2020). The growth of the indicator is a positive factor for the AUD. If
the data turns out to be worse than the forecast, the AUD will decline.

###  **13:15 USD ADP National Employment Report**

Typically, the ADP's private sector employment report has a strong
impact on the market and dollar quotes. An increase in the value of this
indicator has a positive effect on the dollar. The growth in the number
of workers in the private sector in the US is expected to be 168,000 in
February (against an increase by 174,000 in January, a fall by -123,000
in December). The relative growth of the indicator may have a positive
effect on the dollar quotes, while the relative decline in the indicator
will have a negative effect. Therefore, the market reaction may be
negative, and the dollar may decline if the data turns out to be worse
than forecast.

Millions of Americans have previously been laid off due to the
coronavirus pandemic and related quarantine measures. The bulk of
layoffs were concentrated in tourism and retail. Other important sectors
of the economy were also affected. ADP previously reported that the most
significant drop in employment was in the construction and financial
services sectors recently.

While the ADP report does not directly correlate with the official US
Department of Labor data on the labor market, which will be released on
Friday. However, the ADP report is often a harbinger of it, having a
noticeable impact on the market.

###  **15:00 USD Services** **PMI from ISM**

This indicator assesses the state of the services sector in the US
economy. These services sectors (as opposed to the manufacturing sector)
have practically no impact on the country's GDP.

In December this indicator came out with a value of 57.2, and in January
58.7. A result above 50 is seen as positive for the USD. However, a
relative decline in the index could negatively affect the dollar in the
short term. Forecast for February: 58.7, which is likely to positively
affect the USD overall despite the relative decline.

###  **Thursday, March 4**

###  **00:30 AUD Balance of trade. Retail Sales Index**

This indicator (balance of trade) measures the ratio of the volume of
exports and imports of Australia. Growth in exports from Australia leads
to an increase in the trade surplus, which has a positive impact on the
AUD. Previous value (December) A$ 6.785 Billion. A decrease in the trade
surplus may negatively affect the Australian dollar. Conversely, a
growing trade surplus is a positive factor for the AUD. Forecast: A$
6.500 billion.

Retail Sales Index is published monthly by the Australian Bureau of
Statistics and measures total retail sales. The index is often
considered an indicator of consumer confidence and reflects the health
of the retail sector in the near term. A rise in the index is usually
positive for the AUD; a decrease in the indicator will negatively affect
the AUD. The previous value of the index (for December) was +0.6%. If
the data turns out to be weaker than the previous value, the AUD may
sharply decline in the short term. If it's above the previous values,
the AUD is likely to strengthen. Forecast: +0.6% in January.

###  **10:00 EUR Retail sales in the Eurozone**

Retail sales is a major consumer spending indicator that shows the
change in retail sales. A high result strengthens the euro, and vice
versa, a low result weakens it. Forecast for January: -1.1% and -1.3%
(YoY) vs. +2.0% (+0.6% YoY) in December, -6.1% (-2.9% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/))
in November, +1.5% (+4.3% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) in October. The data suggests
that retail sales have yet to reach pre-coronavirus levels after a sharp
drop in March-April 2020, when tough quarantine measures were in place
in Europe.

###  **17:05 USD Speech by the Fed Chairman Jerome Powell**

Powell's comments could have an impact on both short-term and long-term
USD trading if he revisits the Fed's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). A more hawkish
stance on the Fed's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) is seen as positive and strengthens
the US dollar, while a more cautious stance is seen as negative for the
USD.

If he makes unexpected statements, the volatility in trading in the
financial markets may increase. Financial market participants will
carefully study his speech in order to catch signals regarding the
further actions of the Fed.

###  **Friday, March 5**

###  **13:30 USD Average hourly wages. Non-Farm Payrolls. Unemployment
rate**

The most important indicators of the state of the labor market in the
United States in February. Forecast: +0.2% (against +0.2% in January,
+0.8% in December, +0.3% in November) / +0.148 million (against +0.049
million in January, -0.140 million in December , +0.245 million in
November, +0.638 million in October, +1.763 million in July and -20.687
million in April) / 6.4% (against 6.3% in January, 6.7% in December and
November, 6.9% in October, 13.3% in May and 14.7% in April),
respectively.

In general, the figures are not yet encouraging, but they are
understandable due to mass layoffs in American companies and the closure
of offices and stores due to the coronavirus. At the same time, the data
show a gradual improvement in the American labor market after its
collapse in previous months at the beginning of the year. Prior to the
coronavirus, the US labor market remained strong, signaling the
stability of the American economy and supporting the dollar.

It is often difficult to predict the market reaction to the publication
of indicators. Many indicators for previous periods may be revised. Now
it will be even more difficult to do this, because the economic
situation in many other large economies is no better. In any case, when
data from the US labor market is published, a surge in volatility is
expected in trading not only in USD, but throughout the entire financial
market. The most cautious [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s might want to stay out of the market
during this time.
