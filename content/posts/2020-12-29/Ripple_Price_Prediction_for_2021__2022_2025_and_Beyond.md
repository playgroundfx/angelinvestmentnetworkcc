Ripple Price Predictions: 2021 and BeyondJana Kane



Ripple XRP is one of the world's foremost crypto circles - and one of
the most intriguing. Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other big names, it
does not market itself with its decentralization. Instead, the crypto is
closely associated with several banks, investment companies, and
organizations worldwide.

This may seem counterproductive when many traders believe that the
biggest selling point of cryptocurrencies is their freedom of influence
from outside companies. However, crypto experts are increasingly arguing
that it could be the key to Ripple's success.

The article covers the following subjects:

## About Ripple

While the world of cryptocurrency is hardnotorious enough to predict,
some believe Ripple XRP's unique market position means it could escape
the turbulence that could shake the industry in the coming years. But
something big happened to Ripple just before Christmas, so apart from
the backstory and some analysis, our main focus will be on the recent
major fall (and - spoiler - recovery) of Ripple. Because of this, our
price predictions will be different from the ones you're usually used
to.

### A Crash Course on Ripple XRP

In order for traders to understand Ripple price predictions, it is
important to know what Ripple XRP is and why it differs from most other
cryptos on the market.

Ripple was first launched in 2012, and, like Ethereum, the name is often
used to describe both the payment platform and its native currency. The
platform is actually called RippleNet, while the crypto token is Ripple
XRP. (It is usually listed as XRP on exchanges).

Most altcoins that have entered the market are designed to solve some
problems that the founders believed could ultimately limit the success
of Bitcoin, the so-called king of cryptocurrency. Many, like Bitcoin
Cash, have focused on Bitcoin's lack of scalability. However, Ripple
focused on another feature of crypto: its decentralization.

Rather than providing a way for merchants and [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s to make
transactions online without going through a centralized financial
institution (which can be slow, potentially unsafe, and expensive),
Ripple was designed to make it easier for centralized financial
institutions to make payments. Cross-border payments can be even slower
than domestic payments, and they come with much higher transaction costs
- and companies worldwide can make hundreds of these transactions every
day.

To avoid skyrocketing transaction fees and unfavorable exchange rates,
Ripple allows companies to send and receive payments in Ripple XRP. It
offers a globalized currency that bypasses some of the problems that can
plague fiat currency and fully decentralized cryptos.

## Ripple Price Fall (XRP): What's Going On?

The SEC, the US stock market watchdog, is [challenging][1] [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/)
company Ripple Inc. in court, along with its two top figures, CEO Brad
Garlinghouse and founder Christian Larsen. The Securities and Exchange
Commission's accusation is that unregistered securities worth [$1.3
billion were sold in 2013][1]. It is an old case hanging over Ripple for
as long as we can remember. Ripple has always maintained that the
digital currency is a currency instead of a security. Because otherwise,
they'd have to comply with a lot of different rules according to
American law. Many are amazed that the US apparently wants to slaughter
the goose that lays the golden eggs.

### Fast, Cheap, and Secure

We’re not hiding under the proverbial chairs or couches, either. It’s
been on our minds, but to be honest: we never really thought about it.
After all, everything pointed to a completely different outcome. For
example, the same SEC previously labeled Bitcoin and Ethereum as non-
securities. CEO Garlinghouse has repeatedly accused the US
administration that no fewer than eight agencies have a different
opinion about what XRP actually is - a commodity, digital money,
security, or something else.

In recent years, Ripple just continued its work. As we continue to watch
XRP, the digital currency has grown to be used in 55 countries and on
all continents for remittances and cross-border payments. The technique
is, indeed, unique. Employing conversion on the Ripple [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/),
banks, international organizations, multinationals, and payment
providers can send fiat money. Transactions are completed in seconds,
safely, and at a fraction of the traditional cost.

### Cross-Border Payments = Big Business

But not only the big boys are making use of this. The technology also
benefits employees who work in other countries—the so-called migrant
workers. Suppose you are a Thai nanny, Filipino housekeeper, or Mexican
gardener, and you work abroad because you cannot find work in your home
country. Relatively high wages are paid in these countries. That is
usually an Arab country (such as Saudi Arabia or Kuwait) or the US. You
are paid weekly, and each time you send home a large part of your
earnings where many families rely on it. Global [remittances][2] are big
business, with a value of [2 trillion dollars][3] in 2019.

### Competitors

Ripple Inc. was well on its way to becoming a serious competitor. Not
only for the international payment platform SWIFT but also for the many
smaller payment providers. All charge large commissions and are not 100
percent reliable like Ripple is. Errors, mistakes, and money that
somehow never arrives - SWIFT itself admits to using a margin of error
of no less than 6 percent. So, an alternative filled a hole in the
market. Ripple makes small and large money transfers quickly, cheaply,
and reliably, and the road to success is open. And it looked like
Ripple/XRP was going to become much bigger than this.

The company has had [contact](https://www.playgroundfx.com/contact/)s at the [highest political and financial
levels][4] for many years. Think of the World Bank, the ECB, the IMF,
and the World Economic Forum. With rave recommendations and being priced
from all sides – what could possibly go wrong?

### Just Like Thunder

It comes like a bolt from the blue that suddenly a legal reference is
made to the origins of Ripple Inc. As a result, everything that has ever
happened with XRP may be declared illegal. According to American law, if
something turns out to be or is a security, you have to comply with
completely different rules. Other countries, such as the UK and Japan,
have explicitly declared XRP is not a security effect. For example, one
of Ripple's early [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s, Japan's SBI, a financial giant, is still
convinced that they are wrong in the US.

### Price Fall

Ripple Inc., a California-based company, has threatened to leave its own
country several times in the last six months, precisely because of the
unclear treatment of its currency in the US. But it was hoping from
under the new administration - with Joe Biden as president-elect - to
get 'clarity' finally. Naturally, a company cannot wait seven years for
a legislator to come along.

In most countries, the digital currency and [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) technology sector
is far ahead of lagging legislation. In the sense of “Hey, we'll just
keep working in the meantime, and then the legislator will follow.” Not
in Ripple's case: in two days, from December 22 to 23, 2020, the XRP
rate dropped from approximately $0.50 to just under $0.30. From third
place as the most important cryptocurrency, the coin moved to fourth
place, behind stablecoin Tether.

## Ripple Scenarios

The head of the SEC, Jay Clayton, [recently stepped down][5]. A new
chair must be elected. Will it be Hester Peirce, the so-called 'Crypto
mum,' because she has always been committed to digital coins and
[blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) technology? And will the trial against Ripple and both top
people be stopped? Will there be another white rabbit out of the
proverbial top hat when other high financial and political levels rally
behind company and currency? It remains to be seen.

Ripple's business model can be continued in the rest of the world. In fact, Ripple does not need the US at all, although it sees an important market being closed for itself. [Worst case scenario]6. delisting from all US crypto exchanges after being forced to be registered as a "security" (Bitstamp already delisted Ripple, by the way). Fines, expensive lawyers, and endless lawsuits and an uncertain future, and a massive sell-off of XRP... the implications can be very serious.

XRP owners risk getting their coins stuck for a long time while it
looked like the price was going to the moon. If this unsavory business
suddenly turns for the better, thanks to a deus ex machina, then a huge
boost from XRP can be expected. It’s the way you look at it. In any
case, we are all reminded again of what ancient stock market wisdom
states: never put all your (crypto) eggs in one basket…!

## Ripple Price Prediction in 2021

The crypto market is always volatile, as it is generally even smaller
than other markets, so prices can rise and fall more sharply. Therefore,
it is still good to look at developments and the future to say something
about a forecast. Ripple's technical analysis looks positive when viewed
in the long term. Trading Ripple in the short term is riskier. Many
coins rise in the long run due to all new developments, partnerships,
and upgrades. Many wonder why Ripple is rising, but this always has to
do with what's going on with a project.

Either way, as per the recent research by Moody's, [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) standards
will increase by 2021. XRP is now the [fourth-largest][7]
cryptocurrency, which is aiming for a lot of developments by 2021. As
per the XRP price trends, the experts believe that it will enter into
countless financial institution partnerships. By 2021, XRP might even
touch the $2 mark.

## What Could XRP Be Worth? 2021 – 2025

This is a difficult question that cannot be answered immediately. It is,
therefore, best to be aware of the latest Ripple [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/). Then you know
what the project and the community are doing. To have a good
understanding of the [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) projects, check which developments are
planned, which collaborations they are working on or already exist, how
they are working with the community, and other factors. The price of
Ripple can rise dozens of times if everything looks promising and the
team manages to make this a reality. We, therefore, do not make any
predictions ourselves but are very positive about Ripple's future.

## What Experts Had to Say

With the crypto market being so volatile, forecasting the value of XRP
is a difficult task. Let’s look at some of the renowned publications and
their prediction about Ripple (XRP) price prediction. They were all made
before the 22-23 December price-fall, so reflecting on them is a good
lesson for all: one thing can change everything in a blink of an eye.

### #1 Ripple Coin News

Ripple Coin News, the second-largest traffic-based [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) [website](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/website-for-forex-trading/),
predicted that after a difficult time, the coming years might emerge as
a smooth period for Ripple. There will be an addition to the
partnerships, and new technologies might surge its price to 8 to 10
dollars. We’ll have to wait and see.

### #2 Investing Haven

Investing Haven, a cryptocurrency prediction [website](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/website-for-forex-trading/), made a very
optimistic bullish prediction for 2020 as it believed that 2020 was
going to be a flawless year for Ripple. Boy, were they wrong. They had
even stated that XRP might reach as high as $20 by the end of 2020!

### #3 UsLifted

UsLifted, another well-known cryptocurrency prediction [website](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/website-for-forex-trading/), stated
that by the end of 2020, XRP would attain newer heights and reach $22.79
with a circulating supply of 38,739,145,924 XRP. Nope. It didn’t happen.

### #4 Oracle Times Price Prediction

Oracle Times has recently predicted that XRP might go up as much as
2000%. They also added it could be possible only if Ripple becomes the
best choice for cross-border payments by financial institutions. Who
knows? It’s a realistic long-term scenario, that’s for sure.

## Ripple Technical Analysis

XRP has been suffering from a massive slump lately – it has fallen by
almost 50% in just one week, and that may just be the beginning. The
negative effects on the XRP market can be directly linked to the
Securities and Exchange Commission (a government regulatory agency that
protects [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s) announcement that it is suing Ripple’s CEO. Why?

As a quick recap of what was mentioned earlier, the SEC claims that two
top executives raked in $600 million in unregistered XRP sales. Our
technical analysis shows that XRP is experiencing huge selling pressure,
and it will just continue to drop further. The price is extremely
bearish, and there are no signs of short-term recovery in sight.

 _ **XRP Historical Price Changes**_

We can’t make reliable price predictions without looking back at recent
and not-so-recent events. The SEC situation made that even clearer.
Currently, XRP is traded at $0.21787. . Below, you can see how the price
of XRP changed over the years and where it stood on the day of writing,
Sunday, December 27, 2020, after the turbulence it went through with the
SEC.

### Is Ripple (XRP) a Good Investment?

Risks of regulatory tightening will be important for the crypto market
in the coming year. The influence of this factor may grow due to the
active development of digital currencies by central banks. Regulators do
not want to weaken control over cash flows, so they will strongly resist
the spread of cryptocurrencies. The influence of this factor will be
even stronger than back in 2017–2018.

Month| Open| Low-High| Close| Mo,%| Total,%  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
 **2021**  
 **Jan**|  0.18| 0.14-0.22|  **0.15**|  -16.7%| -77.3%  
 **Feb**|  0.15| 0.15-0.18|  **0.17**|  13.3%| -74.2%

 **May**|  0.14| 0.14-0.17|  **0.16**|  14.3%| -75.8%  
 **Jun**|  0.16| 0.16-0.20|  **0.19**|  18.8%| -71.2%  
 **Jul**|  0.19| 0.15-0.19|  **0.16**|  -15.8%| -75.8%  
 **Aug**|  0.16| 0.14-0.16|  **0.15**|  -6.3%| -77.3%  
 **Sep**|  0.15| 0.15-0.18|  **0.17**|  13.3%| -74.2%  
 **Oct**|  0.17| 0.13-0.17|  **0.14**|  -17.6%| -78.8%  
 **Nov**|  0.14| 0.12-0.14|  **0.13**|  -7.1%| -80.3%  
 **Dec**|  0.13| 0.13-0.16|  **0.15**|  15.4%| -77.3%  
  
Oddly enough, the coronavirus pandemic can support the virtual market.
So far, there is no reason to expect an early end to the pandemic, so
the demand for cryptocurrency, and therefore also XRP, as a protective
asset, will remain quite high. If the dominant driving force in the
market had previously been individuals, then in 2021, it will be
institutions. Therefore, next year we will most likely see a smooth rise
in the XRP coin. Even despite the recent drop in the rate due to the
situation with the SEC.
