Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 29.12.2020Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I suggest entry signals
to trade each cryptocurrency.

The BTCUSD market should soon end forming the triangle pattern, and the
price will start rising. Let us study each cryptocurrency pair in more
detail.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

 ****

There has been forming a bullish impulse for a long time; the first four
sub-waves have completed within the impulse. There is now forming the
upward impulse wave (5), namely its fourth leg. The corrective wave 4
looks like a triangle. The contracting triangle should end soon, and the
price will start rising in the impulse wave 5 towards a level of
29500.00. One could enter long positions in the current situation.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 26144.50 TP 29500.00

* * *

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

 ****

The Ripple market is forming the impulse down wave C that is composed of
five sub-waves. The first three legs of the C wave could have completed,
and there is forming the corrective wave [4] composed of the sub-waves
(W)-(X)-(Y). The sub-waves (W) and (X) have completed, and the (Y) has
started unfolding. The market should continue rising in the zigzag-
shaped wave (Y) towards level 0.386, as it is outlined in the chart.

### Trading plan for **[XRPUSD][2]** today:

Buy 0.219, TP 0.386

* * *

## Elliott wave Ethereum analysis

 ****

The corrective wave 4 should have completed as a down triple zigzag.
Next, the price turned up and started rising in the new bullish impulse.
The first two sub-waves [1]-[2] of the new impulse have ended, and the
impulse wave [3] is still developing. The price should be rising to a
level above 790.00 in the next few days.

### Trading plan for  **[ETHUSD][3] **today:

Buy 695.06, TP 750.00
