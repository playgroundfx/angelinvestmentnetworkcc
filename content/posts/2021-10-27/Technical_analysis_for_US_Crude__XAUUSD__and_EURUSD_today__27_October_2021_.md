Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 27.10.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

Oil continues to correct within the short-term uptrend.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

Oil continues to correct within the short-term uptrend. The target of
the correction is the Intermediary Zone 82.41 - 82 16. After reaching
the IZ, set a take profit and search for purchases. To enter purchases,
a pattern in the Intermediary Zone is required. The target for purchases
will be the October 25 high.

The breakout of the Intermediary Zone, namely level 82.16, is required
for trend reversal. In this case, look for oil sales with the target in
the lower Target Zone 79.86 - 79.35.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

Hold shorts entered in the zone of 84.46 - 83.70. TakeProfit:
Intermediary Zone 82.42 - 82.16. StopLoss: at the breakeven.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

Yesterday's idea of buying gold in the Intermediary Zone did not yield
profits. As a result, the IZ was broken out. The level of 1787 was also
reached. However, the short-term trend remains up. The October 22 high
and the Gold Zone 1818 - 1816 serve as the growth target. Therefore,
today it is profitable to look for new purchases in the zone of 1795 -
1787.

A breakout of level 1787 and price consolidation below are required to
sell gold and reverse the trend down. In this case, from the next
trading day, consider entering sales with a target in the lower Target
Zone 1776 - 1772.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

Buy according to the pattern in 1795 - 1787. TakeProfit: Gold Zone 1818
— 1816. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

Yesterday, the euro tested the resistance zone of 1.1639 - 1.1612. The
zone was held. This led to a price decline and the update of the October
25 low.

The euro is trading within a correction to a short-term uptrend. The
Intermediary Zone 1.1577 - 1.1568 serves as a target of the correction.
Now the price is growing again and approaching the Micro-zone 1.1609 -
1.1607. I suggest looking for a sell pattern in this zone on shorter
timeframes with the first target around October 26 low and with the
second target in ​​the Intermediary Zone.

If the micro-zone is broken out, the price may move to the Additional
Zone 1.1633 - 1.1629. Also, look for euro sales according to the pattern
in the beforementioned AZ.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

  1. Sell according to the pattern in Micro-zone 1.1609 - 1.1607. TakeProfit: Intermediary Zone 1.1577 - 1.1568. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. Sell according to the pattern in Additional Zone 1.1633 - 1.1629. TakeProfit: Intermediary Zone 1.1577 - 1.1568. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.
