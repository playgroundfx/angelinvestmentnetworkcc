Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 27.10.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

Ripple should soon finish a short correction, which will be followed by
an impulse upwave.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

The hourly BTCUSD price chart displays the third wave of the large
upward correction [B], the impulse wave (C). The (C) wave is composed of
five sub-waves marked with red letters 1-2-3-4-5. Correction 4 is
currently unfolding as a simple zigzag [A]-[B]-[C]. Impulse [A] has
finished, correction [B] could finish at a level of 63790.00, as
outlined in the chart. One could enter purchases in the current
situation.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 61101.00, TP 63790.00

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

The hourly timeframe displays the upward linking wave X, unfolding as a
triple zigzag [W]-[X]-[Y]-[X]-[Z]. The first four sub-waves of the
zigzag have completed, and the final sub-wave is still developing. The
final motive wave [Z], like the [Y] wave, should be developing as a
standard zigzag (A)-(B)-(C). The bearish correction (B) should finish
soon; next, the price will start rising in the (C) impulse towards a
level of 1.226, marked by subwave [Y].

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] **** today:

Buy 1.112, TP 1.226

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

The ETHUSD market is forming a large corrective wave B, with the final
impulse wave [C] developing inside. Sub-waves (1)-(2)-(3)-(4) have
completed in the [C] wave. The final sub-wave (5) is still unfolding; it
is about to end at a level around 4360.00, marked by the impulse sub-
wave (3). One could enter purchases in the current situation.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Buy 4257.03, TP 4360.00
