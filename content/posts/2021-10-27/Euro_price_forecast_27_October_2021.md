Euro wants to wait and see. Forecast as of 27.10.2021Dmitri Demidenko

The [EURUSD][1] is naturally consolidating ahead of the important event.
The price cannot go outside the trading range of 1.16-1.166. What's
next? Let us discuss the Forex outlook and make up a trading plan.

## Fundamental euro forecast for today

There is too much uncertainty in the market to define the [EURUSD][1]
further trend. I wouldn't enter the market at least until October 28,
when Christine Lagarde will try to convince [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s of the ECB's
unwillingness to raise the interest rate in 2022 or 2023. A little
later, the US GDP data for the third quarter will be released. Despite
the expected slowdown of the indicator from 6.7% to 2.8% by Wall Street
Journal experts, the spread of forecasts is so wide (from 0.8% to 5.1%)
that the markets are left to puzzle over what is actually happening with
the US economy?

Based on strong data on retail sales, jobless claims, PMI, extremely
high housing prices, and increased consumer activity, the US economy
will perform well in the fourth quarter. Moreover, the number of
COVID-19 has been down, corporate reporting is impressive (according to
FactSet, 81% of 144 [S&P 500][2] companies have outperformed analysts'
forecasts). So, the US stock indexes are breaking through all-time
highs, supporting the EURUSD bulls. It was the 57th record high of the
[S&P 500][2] that prevented the euro from falling below $1.16.

At the same time, the strength of the US economy is a reason to expect
the tightening of the Fed's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) and sell Treasuries. Hedge
funds have had their highest net short positions on 2-year Treasuries
since October 2017. However, the positioning gap between hedge funds
asset managers has been the widest since 2016. This further increases
the uncertainty, getting the [EURUSD][1] to remain in the short-term
consolidation.

### Dynamics of positions in Treasuries

The euro is pressed down by the expectations of Christine Lagarde's
dovish tone at a press conference following the upcoming Governing
Council meeting. Financial markets stubbornly ignore the statements of
the ECB representatives, including Philip Lane, and continue to price
expectations of a rate hike in late 2022 in the quotes of trading
instruments. Lagarde should dissuade [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s. Will she succeed? The
ECB is not planning to tighten financial conditions, but will Lagarde
manage to convince [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s?

### Market expectations for ECB rate

Furthermore, the pound doesn't support the euro any longer. More and
more [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s doubt that Andrew Bailey's announcement that the Bank of
England will be forced to act to curb inflation is true. Markets are
less sure that the BoE will raise the rates in November, which presses
down the sterling and the [EURUSD][1].

### Weekly [EURUSD][1] trading plan

Therefore, it is not clear how the market will react to the ECB meeting.
It is also hard to predict the US GDP data for the third quarter. It is
risky to trade amid the uncertainty in the market. The [EURUSD][1]
should be consolidating in the range of 1.1585-1.1625 ahead of the ECB
meeting. I do not recommend entering any trades.
