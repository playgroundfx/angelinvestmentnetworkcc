Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 06.10.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

Gold price is testing short-term uptrend's key support.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

The short-term oil trend is up. Target Zone 78.59 - 78.08 was broken out
yesterday. The next growth target is the Gold Zone 80.89 - 80.63.

Local support 78.56 was tested tonight. This led to a buyers' reaction
and a price rise. The growth target is to update yesterday's high.

After updating yesterday's high, rearrange support zones, wait for a
correction, and look for a buy pattern.

To enter sales, it is required that traders failed to update yesterday's
high. As a result, the correction starts to develop from the current
prices, within which the level of 78.56 will be broken out. This will
make it possible to enter sales with a target in the Additional Zone
77.94 - 77.82.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

Yesterday, gold traders tested the key support of the short-term uptrend
1751 - 1749. This led to a limited price rise at the US trading session
and the holding of the zone.

Today the price is testing the trend's key support again. Our task is to
find a buy pattern and buy gold with a target at the week's high.

An alternative scenario suggests the breakout of the Intermediary Zone
1751 - 1749 and the trend reversal. In this case, sell gold with a
target in the lower Target Zone 1733 - 1729.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

Open buy positions according to the pattern in 1751 - 1749. TakeProfit:
1770. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

On Wednesday morning, the short-term euro downtrend continues. At the
moment, the bears are trying to consolidate the price below the
Additional Zone 1.1596 - 1.1591. If successful, then there will be a
further euro price decline with the target in the zone of 1.1551 -
1.1543.

If the buyers manage to return the price to the Additional Zone during
the European session, then the upward pattern to work in correction will
be preserved. In this case, it will be possible to open purchases with a
stop beyond today's low and a take profit in the Intermediary Zone
1.1659 - 1.1650.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

Open buy positions according to the pattern in 1.1611 - 1.1591.
TakeProfit: Intermediary Zone 1.1659 - 1.1650. StopLoss: according to
the pattern rules.
