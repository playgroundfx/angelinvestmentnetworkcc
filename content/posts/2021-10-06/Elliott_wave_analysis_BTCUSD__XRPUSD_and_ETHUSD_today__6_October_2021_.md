Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 06.10.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

The BTCUSD must have finished the upward impulse sub-wave, so the price
should start correction in the fourth subwave of the large impulse.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

The BTCUSD market is forming the large corrective wave [B], composed of
sub-waves (A)-(B)-(C). There is currently forming the upward wave (C) as
an impulse 1-2-3-4-5. So far, this impulse has been half-complete. The
price must have stopped rising in impulse 3, so it should soon start
being corrected in wave 4 towards a level of 47700.00. At this level,
wave 4 will retrace impulse 3 by 38.2%. It is relevant to sell in the
current situation.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Sell 51598.75, TP 47700.00

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

The XRPUSD market has completed the linking wave (X), and the price is
declining in the new corrective wave. There should be forming a double
zigzag  W-X-Y. The motive wave W must have completed as a zigzag
[A]-[B]-[C]. There is now unfolding the bullish linking wave X as a
zigzag composed of three sub-waves [A]-[B]-[C]. The impulse wave [C]
should complete at a level around 1.200. Next, the Ripple price will be
falling in wave Y. At level 1.200, the X wave will reach 61.8% Fibonacci
ratio of wave W.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] **** today:

Buy 1.061, TP 1.200

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

The ETHUSD market continues forming the corrective wave B as a simple
zigzag [A]-[B]-[C]. Impulse [A] and a zigzag-shaped correction [B] must
have finished. There is now unfolding wave [C] as an impulse. Its third
leg, sub-wave (3), could end at a level of 3675.74, where wave (B)
finished previously. It is relevant to buy in the current situation.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Buy 3494.35, TP 3675.74
