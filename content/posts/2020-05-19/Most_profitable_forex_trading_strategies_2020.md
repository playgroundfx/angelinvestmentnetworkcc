Three latest and most profitable Forex [trading strategies](https://www.fintechee.com/forex-trading-strategies/)Jana Kane

## Why is it necessary to use a forex strategy?

Every trading manual or instruction insists that a trading strategy is
necessary for successful trading. First of all, when you select your
forex strategy you gain greater clarity of the trading process, which
helps minimize trading risks.

Profitable Forex strategy is an instruction. A trader faces high risks
without using any system or plan. If a trader follows it strictly,
he/she will avoid many mistakes. Market is hard to predict, and it often
results in trading mistakes.

Your forex strategy will tell you what you should do various changeable
market conditions. Your trading strategy should be suited for any
situation.

You won’t try to guess when to enter or exit a trade. Your trading
strategy will prompt you when you need to enter or exit the market. It
doesn’t mean that even the best [Forex trading](https://www.fintechee.com/forex-trading-strategies/) strategy can’t be changed.
But it mustn't contain any unjustified elements.

## Types of [Forex trading](https://www.fintechee.com/forex-trading-strategies/) strategies

[Trading strategies][2] can be based on various methods. The most
popular [trading strategies](https://www.fintechee.com/forex-trading-strategies/) are:

  * Trading strategy based in the technical indicators
  * Trading strategy based on the Bollinger bands
  * Trading strategy based on the moving averages
  * Trading strategy based on the technical analysis and price patterns
  * Trading strategy based on Fibonacci retracements
  * Candlestick  trading strategy
  * Trend trading strategy
  * Flat trading strategy
  * Scalping
  * Trading strategy based on the fundamental analysis

## Three most profitable Forex [trading strategies](https://www.fintechee.com/forex-trading-strategies/)

 **Important!** These strategies make up a basis to develop your own
[Forex trading](https://www.fintechee.com/forex-trading-strategies/) system. The suggested setting and recommended levels to
put pending orders are nothing more than a recommendation.

If you do not like the [backtest](https://www.fintechee.com/backtesting-a-portfolio/)ing or the performance on a real account,
the strategy may not be a fail. You just need to find individual
parameters for indicators suitable for a particular asset or a current
market situation.

  *  **Note!** The description of each strategy contains the trading system’s template with indicators and a brief instruction for their installation. At the end of the article, there is a separate section devoted to practical recommendations. It explains [how to](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-trading-how-to/) launch these templates in real trading and start making money with LiteForex! If you are interested in a strategy, open a demo account with LiteForex, and follow the recommendations given in this overview. If you have any questions, feel free to ask them in the comments!

### 1\. Scalping strategy “Bali”

This strategy is quite popular, at least, you can find its description
on many trading [website](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/website-for-forex-trading/)s. However, Internet resources suggest different
recommendations concerning the Bali trading system.

According to the developer, Bali is a scalping forex strategy, or at
least, it is designed for short term time frames. It is also good for
day trading. It suggests quite short stop losses (SL) and take profits
(TP). However, the recommended timeframe is rather long, and so, signals
are sent quite rarely.

The developers recommend using the H1 timeframe and the EUR/USD currency
pair.

Indicators used:

  * Linear Weighted Moving Average. Period 48 (red line).

![LiteForex: Most profitable [Forex trading](https://www.fintechee.com/forex-trading-strategies/) strategies 2020][3]

Linear Weighted Moving Average serves here as an additional filter. As
the LWMA attaches more importance to the most recent price moves, there
are almost no delays in the long-term timeframes.

Occasionally, the LWMA may send an early signal in the long run. But
this strategy considers only the MA position relative to the price
movements. If the LWMA is below, it is a buy signal. If the line is
above the price, it is a sell signal.

  * Trend [Envelopes](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/envelopes.html) V2.  Period 2 (orange and blue lines).

![LiteForex: Most profitable [Forex trading](https://www.fintechee.com/forex-trading-strategies/) strategies 2020][4]

The indicator is also based on Moving Average, but it has a different
calculation formula. Its layout is more accurate (the price noise is
reduced).

It allows you to identify the breaks in the trend a little earlier than
the ordinary MA. Trend [Envelopes](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/envelopes.html) has an interesting property. The line’s
color and its location changes when the price breaks through its former
trendline. It is a kind of trading signal.

![LiteForex: Most profitable [Forex trading](https://www.fintechee.com/forex-trading-strategies/) strategies 2020][5]

The indicator is displayed in a separate window under the chart. This is
an oscillator that identities trend pivot points. It does it quicker
than standard oscillators.

It has two lines: the signal line is dotted, the additional line is
solid. But the receiving line has two types of colors (orange and
green).

MA is a standard MT4 tool, the rest two indicators can be obtained for
free in the archive via [this link][6]. To add them to the trading
terminal, in MT4, click on the “File – Open data folder”. Next, follow
the directory MQL4/Indicators. Past the indicators into the folder and
restart the platform.

 **Conditions to open a long position:**

  * The price breaks through the orange line of Trend [Envelopes](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/envelopes.html) upside. At the same candlestick, the down orange line changed into the rising blue line. 

  * The candlestick is above LWMA. When the previous condition is met, expect the candlestick above the MA to appear. The candlestick must close above the red line of LWMA. There must be the blue line of Trend [Envelopes](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/envelopes.html) at the signal candlestick.

  * The additional line of the DSS of momentum at the signal candlestick should be green. This line must be above the signal dotted line (that is, it is breaking it through or has already broken).

Enter a trade when the signal candlestick closes. I recommend setting a
stop loss at a distance of 20-25 points in four-digit quote. A take
profit is 40-50 points.

![LiteForex: Most profitable [Forex trading](https://www.fintechee.com/forex-trading-strategies/) strategies 2020][7]

The arrow points to the signal candlestick where Trend [Envelopes](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/envelopes.html) colors
change. Note (purple ovals) that the blue line is below the orange and
is moving (otherwise the signal should be ignored). At the signal
candlestick, the green line of the DSS of momentum is above the dotted
line.

 **Conditions to open a short position:**

  * The price breaks the blue line of Trend [Envelopes](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/envelopes.html) downside. At the same candlestick, the rising blue line changes into the falling orange line. 

  * The candlestick is below LWMA. When the previous condition is met, expect a candlestick to appear below the moving average. It must close under the red line of LWMA. There must orange line of Trend [Envelopes](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/envelopes.html) at the signal candlestick. 

  * The DSS of momentum additional line should be orange at the signal candlestick. It should be located below the signal dotted line (that is, it is breaking through it or has already broken). 

![LiteForex: Most profitable [Forex trading](https://www.fintechee.com/forex-trading-strategies/) strategies 2020][8]

A few cases when you shouldn’t enter a trade:

1\. The below screen displays a candlestick that closed at the level of
MA (the red line), almost fully below the line.

![LiteForex: Most profitable [Forex trading](https://www.fintechee.com/forex-trading-strategies/) strategies 2020][9]

2\. The below screen shows that the DSS is below its signal line at the
signal candlestick. Besides, the blue line is flat, not rising.

![LiteForex: Most profitable [Forex trading](https://www.fintechee.com/forex-trading-strategies/) strategies 2020][10]

Signals are relatively rare, you can wait for one signal for a few days.
In 50% of cases, you’d better monitor the trade and exit it earlier,
before the price hits the take profit. Do not trade when the market is
flat. [Test this strategy][11] directly in the browser and assess the
performance.

### 2\. Candlestick strategy “Fight the tiger”

This is a profitable weekly trading strategy, which can be used for
position trading with different currency pairs. It is based on the
springy action of the price — if the price rose quickly, it should fall
sooner or later.

We can use a chart in any terminal and a timeframe W1 (although you can
also use a [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) timeframe). You should analyze the size of the
candlestick body of different currency pairs. There is a wide range of
pairs: [AUDCAD][12], [AUDJPY][13], [AUDUSD][14], [EURGBP][15],
[EURJPY][16], [GBPUSD][17], [CHFJPY][18], [NZDCHF][19], [EURAUD][20],
[AUDCHF][21], [CADCHF][22], [EURUSD][23], [EURCAD][24], [GBPCHF][25].

Next,  choose the pair with the longest distance between the opening and
closing prices within the week.  You will enter a trade on this pair at
the beginning of the next week.

 **Conditions to open a long trade:**

You enter a long trade at the beginning of the next week. You should set
a stop loss at a distance of 100-140 points and a take profit - at 50-70
points.

In the middle of the week, exit the trade. It may be closed with a take
profit or a stop loss. Then, again expect the beginning of the week and
place a new order. Do not place orders at the end of the week.

![LiteForex: Most profitable [Forex trading](https://www.fintechee.com/forex-trading-strategies/) strategies 2020][26]

It is clear from the chart that, following each bearish candlestick,
there is always a bullish one (although it smaller).

The matter is that what period you should take to compare the relative
length of candlesticks. It is individual for each currency pair.

Note that some small bear candlesticks were followed by rising
candlesticks. However, according to risk management, you shouldn’t open
the counter-trade  (a buy tarde). The relatively small fall, occurred in
the previous week, may continue.

 **Conditions to open a short position:**

Open a short position at the beginning of the next week.

![LiteForex: Most profitable [Forex trading](https://www.fintechee.com/forex-trading-strategies/) strategies 2020][27]

Red arrows point to the candlesticks that had large bodies relative to
the previous bullish candlesticks. All signals were profitable except
for the trade that is marked with a blue trade. The disadvantages of the
strategy are rare signals, although the percentage of profit is quite
high. And you can launch the strategy trading multiple currency pairs.

This strategy has an interesting modification based on similar logic.
Investors, day traders, working with a trading volume prefer intraday
strategies. They do not have enough money to make a strong influence on
the market.

So, if there is a strong market action in the weekly chart, this signal
the pressure made by big traders. Differently put, if there are three
weekly candlesticks in the same direction, the fourth candlestick should
be in this direction too.

The psychological factor is also important here. 4 candlesticks are
equal to the period of one month. Those, who have been pushing the
market in one direction, should start taking the profit in a month.

Strategy principle:

  * There is a “three candlesticks” (rising or falling) pattern in the weekly chart. 

  * It is good if the next following candlestick is bigger than the previous one. Doji candlesticks (candlesticks without bodies) are not taken into account. 

  * A stop loss is set at the close level of the first candlestick in the sequence. The take profit is 50%-100% of the last candlestick, but it is often better to exit the trade manually. 

An example of such trade setups is in the screenshot below.

![LiteForex: Most profitable [Forex trading](https://www.fintechee.com/forex-trading-strategies/) strategies 2020][28]

4 patterns out 5 are profitable. The strategy’s drawback is that you can
wait for a pattern for quite a long period of time. It can take 2 or 3
months.

But if you launch the strategy on multiple currency pairs, this term of
expectation is justified. Take swaps into account!

### 3. “Profit Parabolic” trading system based on a Moving Average

The strategy is referred to as a universal one, and it is often
recommended among [Forex trading](https://www.fintechee.com/forex-trading-strategies/) strategies for [beginners](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-for-beginners/). It employs the
standard MT4 indicators, EMAs (exponential moving averages), and
[Parabolic SAR](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/parabolic-sar.html) that serves as a confirmation tool.

This is a trend strategy. Most sources suggest using it in different
timeframes, including minute ones, but market noise lowers its
efficiency in very short timeframes. It is better to use timeframes of
М15-М30. You can trade any currency pair, but you may need to custom
indicators’ settings.

Indicators used:

  * EMA with periods 5, 25, and 50. ЕМА (5) is red, ЕМА(25) and ЕМА (50) are yellow. Apply to – close (closing prices).

## ![LiteForex: Most profitable [Forex trading](https://www.fintechee.com/forex-trading-strategies/) strategies 2020][29]

![LiteForex: Most profitable [Forex trading](https://www.fintechee.com/forex-trading-strategies/) strategies 2020][30]

 **Conditions to open a long position:**

 **Conditions to open a short trade:**

You can enter the trade at the same candlestick when the moving averages
have crossed. A stop loss is set close to the local low, take profit is
20-25 points. But if you manage trades manually, you can make a bigger
profit.

For example, you can exit the trade when ЕМА(5) becomes flat. It
indicates a change in the slope from a rise to a flat.

![LiteForex: Most profitable [Forex trading](https://www.fintechee.com/forex-trading-strategies/) strategies 2020][31]

It is clear from this screenshot that all the three signals (two longs
and one short) yielded profit.

One could have entered the trade at the next candlestick. It is after
the signal one (to be sure in the trend direction). However, a good
entry point would have been missed.

It is up to you whether to risk or not. These parameters will hardly
work for hourly timeframes. Therefore, you should always test the
indicators’ performance for each timeframe using a period of at least
three years.

Well, you are familiar with the theory now. I want to briefly describe
[how to](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-trading-how-to/) launch these strategies in real trading.

 **Are you ready? Let’s get down to real trading in the Forex market!**

### From theory to practice

 **Step 1.** Open a demo account. It is free, you do not have to top up
the deposit. It takes about 15 minutes and doesn’t require verification.

On the [website](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/website-for-forex-trading/) home page, there is the Registration button. Click on it
and follow the instructions. You can also open an account in other
menus. For example, in the upper menu, trading conditions for an

 **Step 2.** Study the [functions](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/basic-functions/) of the trader profile. It won’t take
much time. It has a user-friendly, intuitive interface.

make a trade. The trader profile is described in this [overview][32].

 **Step 3.** Open trading platform. In the client space, there is a
built-in terminal but doesn’t allow adding any templates. So, the
strategies like “Bali” or “Profit Parabolic” can be launched only in
MT4.

3.1 Trading with MT4:

## ![LiteForex: Most profitable [Forex trading](https://www.fintechee.com/forex-trading-strategies/) strategies 2020][33]

  * Download the template (just in case, I give the [link][6] again. The description of the strategy above explains [how to](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-trading-how-to/) set the template in the MT4).
  * Try entering the trades according to the descriptions of “Bali” and “Profit Parabolic” strategies.

offered in this article. Believe in yourself and do not be afraid of
experiments!

### Features of effective Forex strategies

And finally, let us see what features a profitable trading strategy has.
What characteristics shout it have? I can define the three most
important features of the effective trading strategy:

  * Minimum lagging indicators. The less is lagging, the more accurate is the forecast. 

  * Simplicity. It is very important to understand the main principles of your trading strategy. It is better to be an expert on the simple strategy than to use complex strategies. It is very important to understand your [Forex trading](https://www.fintechee.com/forex-trading-strategies/) system. 

  * Special features. A strategy should be adjusted to your trading style and methods, your personality, special circumstances, and so on. 

It is very important to develop your trading strategy. However, first,
you need to try many other strategies that have been developed and
tested. In the Forex blog, you will find many working forex strategies
that you can download for free. Before you launch a trading system, test
the strategy on a [demo account][40] in the MetaTrader terminal.

 **Conclusion.** To be a successful Forex trader, you should develop
your own trading strategy.

Get familiar with the latest trading systems, study the existing forex
[trading strategies](https://www.fintechee.com/forex-trading-strategies/), develop and improve your trading plan. Following
this simple instruction will allow you to be satisfied with your trading
performance.

 I wish you successful trading!
