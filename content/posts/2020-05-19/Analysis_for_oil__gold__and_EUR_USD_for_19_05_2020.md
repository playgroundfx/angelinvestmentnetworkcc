Analysis for oil, gold, and EUR/USD for 19.05.2020Alex Rodiоnov

###  **USCrude – oil**

The oil price has consolidated above Target Zone 3 [26.67 – 25.92].
Therefore, the next upside target for middle-term purchases is Target
Zone 4 [34.17 – 33.42].

The key support to the uptrend is in the zone of [19.19 — 18.00].

![LiteForex: Analysis for oil, gold, and EUR/USD for 19.05.2020][1]

The oil short-term trend is still up. Buyers reached the resistance Gold
Zone 3 [30.04 – 29.67] yesterday. The didn’t break the zone out
immediately. They may do it today. If so, the next target will be in
Target Zone 4 [34.20 – 33.40].

If the price is corrected down, we shall enter new buy trades according
to the patterns after the test of strong supports, Additional Zone
[28.19 - 27.89], Intermediary Zone [25.19 – 24.59]. A take profit could
be set close to the local [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) high.

 **[USCrude][3]Trading ideas for today:  **

  1. Buy according to the pattern in Additional Zone [28.19 - 27.89]. TakeProfit: 31.00. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.
  2. Buy according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone [25.19 - 24.59]. TakeProfit: 31.00. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

###  **XAUUSD – gold**

Gold traders failed to break out Target Zone 5 [1757.2 – 1751.2], and
the price is being corrected. The correction target should be the test
of the trend key support [1673.6 – 1664.4].

I suggest considering sell trades in the resistance zone [1757.2 —
1744.0].

The gold short-term is still upward, but the price now being corrected
down. The price broke out the first strong support Additional Zone
[1742.2 – 1740.0] yesterday. The correction should continue with a
likely target at the trend key support [1719.3 - 1714.8].

I suggest using the current situation and considering sell trades in the
correction, one could enter shorts in the zone of [1752.0 – 1740.0]. To
open sell positions, we need a pattern.

When the price reaches Intermediary Zone, we shall again consider
purchases.

 **[XAUUSD][6] Trading ideas for today: **

Sell according to the pattern in the zone of [1752.0 - 1740.0].
TakeProfit: Intermediary Zone [1719.3 - 1714.8]. StopLoss: according to
the pattern rules.

###  **EURUSD – euro/dollar**

The EURUSD is rising in the middle-term uptrend. The upside target is to
break through the local high of May 1. The second target is Target Zone
2 [1.1109 — 1.1091].

![LiteForex: Analysis for oil, gold, and EUR/USD for 19.05.2020][7]

The EUR/USD short-term trend reversed up yesterday. The key resistance
[1.0866 – 1.0857] was broken out by the buyers. The price is now rising,
getting close to Target Zone [1.0966 – 1.0948].

When Target Zone is reached, we shall see if the bulls break the zone
out and consolidate the price above. If they do, the next upside target
in the trend will be Gold Zone [1.1048 – 1.1039].

I suggest the main scenario for today is bullish, so it is relevant t
enter purchases in Additional Zone [1.0892 — 1.0887].

![LiteForex: Analysis for oil, gold, and EUR/USD for 19.05.2020][8]

 **[EURUSD][9] Trading ideas for today: **

Buy according to the pattern in Additional Zone [1.0892 - 1.0887].
TakeProfit: Target Zone [1.0966 - 1.0948]. StopLoss: according to the
pattern rules.

> IZ - Intermediary Zone: responsible for the price momentum reversing

>

> TZ - Target Zone: a zone that is 75% likely to be reached after IZ
breakout.

>

> GZ - Gold Zone: zone in the medium-term momentum.

>

> All zones are calculated based on the average [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) price of the
instrument and margin requirements of the futures.
