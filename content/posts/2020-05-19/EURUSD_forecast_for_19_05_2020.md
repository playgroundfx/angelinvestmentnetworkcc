Euro: strength is in unity!Dmitri Demidenko

## Europe starts acting in unity

Good [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) has come from Europe, and the US dollar weakens amid the S&P
500 rally. This sends the euro up. The [EUR/USD][1] has rallied up as
Germany and France are willing to join efforts in the aid to the EU
countries worst affected by Covid-19. Besides, the ECB is also willing
to do its best to support the euro-area economies hit by the pandemic.
Besides, the U.S. biotechnology company Moderna announced that its
coronavirus vaccine shows early signs of the viral immune response. The
favorable information environment allowed the US stocks to surge above
the April corrective highs.

The EUR/USD bulls were held back by numerous negative factors. The euro-
area countries couldn’t find a compromise on the fiscal stimulus, and
the idea of corona-bonds failed. The German constitutional court issued
an unexpected ruling that could limit the ECB abilities in assisting the
euro-area economy. Also, the demand for the greenback as a safe-haven
currency was high amid the expectations for the S&P 500 sell-offs. Once
the negative was eased, the [EUR/USD][1] has started climbing up.

French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel
offered a €500-billion European recovery fund to be distributed to the
EU countries worst affected by the pandemic. Remarkably, the resources
for the fund are planned to be formed by issuing bonds, which will be
repaid gradually from the EU's overall budget. Remember, a huge part of
its costs is funded by Germany. Corona bonds seem to be adopted,
although in a different form than it was originally thought. According
to the German Chancellor, “the EU must act together, the nation state
has no chance if it acts on its own”.

The euro has also been supported by Christine Lagarde, who expresses no
concerns about either the QE associated with the pandemic or the
quantitative easing program launched in 2015. The ECB sees no obstacles
to achieving its goals, and each national bank in the euro area is
independent and cannot receive instructions from the government. The
European central bank seems to be unwilling to give any explanations to
the German judges, it won’t stop providing support to the countries hit
by the pandemic. It is especially acute for Italy, whose public debt,
according to Bloomberg, could be out of control. As a result, Rome will
have to restructure Italy’s debt.

Positive [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) from Germany and France, together with the ECB clear
position, strengthened the euro. The euro has been also supported by the
[news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) from the US. The US stocks are rising amid the information about
coronavirus vaccine, and the report from South Korea that recovered
coronavirus patients are not infectious. Jerome Powell announced the Fed
is willing to hold the interest rates close to zero until the central
bank is confident that the US economy has recovered. The [EUR/USD][1]
has been up above the bottom of figure 9. Unless the US-China trade war
resumes, the pair may well be rising to the top of the middle-term
consolidation range 1.065-1.115.
