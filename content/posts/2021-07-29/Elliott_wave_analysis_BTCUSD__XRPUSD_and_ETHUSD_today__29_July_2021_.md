Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 29.07.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

The cryptocurrency pairs are forming the final legs of the bullish
impulses. Let study the chart structure of each pair in more detail.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

The BTCUSD market is forming the bullish double zigzag (W)-(X)-(Y).
There is developing the final motive wave (Y) as a standard zigzag,
composed of three sub-waves A-B-C. Wave A is an impulse, the final wave
C is also unfolding as a five-wave impulse, it has not completed. The
bearish correction [4] should complete soon. Next, the price could go up
in sub-wave [5] to a level of 41905.00. At this level, wave (Y) will be
161.8% of (W).

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 39907.50, TP 41905.00

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

Since late June, the XRPUSD market has been forming a horizontal
pattern, flat A-B-C. Sub-waves A and B have completed as zigzags; A is a
standard zigzag, B is a triple zigzag. There is now forming the final
wave C as a bullish impulse [1]-[2]-[3]-[4]-[5]. The market should
continue rising in the final leg of impulse [5] to a level of 0.783.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] **** today:

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

There is forming the upwards correction B, composed of three major sub-
waves [A]-[B]-[C]. Impulse wave [A] and correction [B], a triple zigzag,
have completed. There is forming the final leg of the upward impulse
wave [C], sub-wave (5). The Ethereum price should go up to a level of
2425.00. At this level, wave [C] will be equal to wave [A]. As impulse
waves tend to equality, this ratio is highly likely to be reached.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Buy 2283.84, TP 2425.00
