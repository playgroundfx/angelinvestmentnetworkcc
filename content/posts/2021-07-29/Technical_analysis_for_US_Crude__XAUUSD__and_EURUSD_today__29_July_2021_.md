Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

The oil price has broken out the resistance level of 72.10 and is moving
towards the Gold Zone 73.19 - 72.92.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

The oil price has broken out the resistance level of 72.10 and is moving
towards the Gold Zone 73.19 - 72.92. The short-term trend remains up.
Strong support levels are shifting. The Additional Zone is now at levels
71.19 - 71.05 and the Intermediary Zone is at 69.82 - 69.55. It is
profitable to consider new oil purchases according to the trend at the
aforementioned supports with the target in the Gold Zone 73.19 - 72.92.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

Buy according to the pattern in Additional Zone 71.19 - 71.05.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

Yesterday, XAU price rose after [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) about the Fed's interest rate.
Today gold is testing the border of the short-term downtrend 1817 -
1815. If the zone is broken out, the trend will reverse up, and the
target for purchases will be the upper Target Zone 1842 - 1837.

If the price does not break out the Intermediary Zone 1817 - 1815, then
sell gold according to the pattern with a target at yesterday's low.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

Sell according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 1817 - 1815.
TakeProfit: 1793. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

Before the opening of the European trading session, the EURUSD price is
trading above the Intermediary Zone 1.1815 - 1.1842. The Intermediary
Zone serves as the border of the short-term downtrend. If it is broken
out today, the trend will reverse up, and the target for purchases will
be the Target Zone 1.1948 - 1.1930.

If during today's trading the price returns under resistance, then look
for a sell reversal pattern. The sales target will be the July 23 low.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:
