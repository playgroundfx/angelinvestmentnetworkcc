LiteForex online platform vs. MT4Oleg Tkachenko

MT4 is thought to be the most popular trading platform. However,
LiteForex software designers offer even a more interesting product. The
LiteForex trading terminal is more straightforward and user-friendly,
visually convenient, without being overloaded with ample [functions](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/basic-functions/). It
does not suggest trading using Expert Advisors or uploading custom
indicators. However, you can build both active and passive trading
strategies based on the LiteForex trading terminal, which is not
provided in the MT4. Read on, and you will learn more about the benefits
of the LiteForex trading platform compared to the MT4.

## LiteForex online trading platform vs. MT4: choose the best

What trading platform do you prefer? As practice shows, the majority of
traders choose MT4. The product by MetaQuotes has been so popular that
no other trading terminal, including event MT5, could not outperform the
MT4. However, I can’t say it is the perfect trading platform ever; it
also has some flaws. The flaws of the MetaTrader 4 have been eliminated
in the LiteForex (LF) trading terminal. I will cover the pros and cons
of the LF online platform further.

### LiteForex online trading platform compared to MT4

The [LiteForex trading platform ][1]is a full-featured tool that allows
you to make trading transactions, develop investment strategies, manage
statistics; you can do all of this in your client profile. MT4 is a
trading platform (software) with trading charts and a number of trading
tools. The LiteForex trading terminal is an operating system, also
including [functions](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/basic-functions/) of a trading platform. You can learn more about the
features of the LiteForex Client Space [here][2].

The first feature of the LiteForex web platform is that it has a user-
friendly and convenient interface. If you ask a person who has seen MT4
and LiteForex terminal for the first time what he/she visually likes
more, he/she will definitely choose the LF trading terminal. In [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of
the convenience of the trading instruments’ location, MT4 definitely
wins. The problem with the MetaTrader is that there are too many ample
tools. Although most of the [functions](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/basic-functions/) could be useful, they can confuse
a beginner trader.

Another advantage of the LF platform is its speed. MT4 is installed on
your PC while the LiteForex terminal is on the broker’s server and
operates directly in the browser. This eliminates the problem of low
processing speed due to the incompatibility with the operating system.
Also, MT4 is often criticized for its slow work due to the automatic
loading of all sorts of "rubbish": unnecessary quotes, unnecessary [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/),
etc. You can speed up the work of MT4 if you regularly delete the
remnants of scripts and indicators, disable [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) updates, and delete
some of the quotes. But why bother if you can use the LiteForex
terminal?

The third benefit is that the LiteForex trading platform is not only a
trading terminal but also a service for passive income. Each trader can
combine active trading with the [passive investment strategy][3]. One
can copy signals of professional traders (forex copy trading), create a
referral network ([affiliate program][4]), and so on. There is a trading
community where you can copy the trading behavior and signals of
successful traders. There is no such an opportunity in the MT4.

The fourth advantage (of the LF built-in terminal is the analytical support package. Here you can find: the [market sentiment indicator][5] (which reflects the opinion of most traders cooperating with the broker), signals of technical indicators (stochastic, moving averages of different periods, Ichimoku, and so on), volatility data, price changes in percentages, and so on. In MT4, the developers tried to insert something like this, but the analytics is uploaded separately, slowing down the platform speed. Furthermore, the trader has to open additional serves, like Investing, to study the forecasts.

Other advantages of the LiteForex web platform:

  * There are additional technical tools. In addition to standard indicators present in the MT4, there are more than fifteen non-standard indicators: KDJ, Aroon, and others. You can add these tools to the MT4 manually, but you have to bother to find their working templates on the Internet, while LiteForex offers built-in tools. 

  * You can communicate with other traders. There is trader chat, and you can create your own channel.

  * It provides visual comparative features of price movements and trends for major assets.

However, despite the apparent benefits of the LiteForex trading
terminal, the MT4 platform has some indisputable advantages. That is why
the MT4 remains one of the best. The LiteForex web terminal was created
to satisfy the needs of an ordinary trader. The MT4 is a trading
platform for professionals. There is [a built-in strategy tester][6] for
indicators and trading systems with [backtest](https://www.fintechee.com/backtesting-a-portfolio/)ing. It supports algorithmic
trading, creating templates, and so on.

What to choose: the LiteForex web platform or the MT4? I suggest you use
the advantages of both trading platforms. You can use the MT4 for
comprehensive analysis and testing trading systems. It is convenient to
use the LiteForex terminal for intraday trading and the creation of
passive investment strategies.

 **Summary.** The LiteForex trading platform was developed based on
traders interested in a simple, convenient tool for comfortable trading.
It has everything you need to analyze the market situation and make a
trading decision. The trade managing features are optimal and always at
hand. MT4 is software, an operating system with several basic tools. At
the same time, the LiteForex platform is a complete system for different
types of making money, from active trading to copy trading and affiliate
programs.

  * Are you a beginner trader or a professional willing to combine active and passive ways of earning a living? Your choice is the LiteForex trading platform.

  * Are you a professional who values time, comfort, reliability? Your choice is the LiteForex terminal.

  * Are you a trader who prefers trading with Expert Advisors who likes non-standard tools? Your choice is MT4. You can download the MetaTrader terminal on the LiteForex [website](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/website-for-forex-trading/).
