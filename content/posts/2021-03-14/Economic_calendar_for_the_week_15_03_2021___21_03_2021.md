Economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the week 15.03.2021 – 21.03.2021Jana Kane

##  **Review of the main events of the Forex economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the
next trading week (15.03.2021 – 21.03.2021)**

 **Trading on key Forex [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/): next week we are expecting the publication
of important macro statistics from China, Australia, the US, Canada, as
well as the results of the meetings of the central banks of the US,
Great Britain and Japan.**

The sale of US government bonds continues, which contributes to the
growth of their yield and the strengthening of the dollar. The yield of
10-year US bonds last week renewed a 13-month high at 1.635%.

American stock indices also mainly rose last week, especially the
industrial DJIA, which added +3% rising to a new all-time high of
32676.0.

Investors reacted positively to the [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) that the US President Joe Biden
had signed a $1.9 trillion stimulus package previously approved by
Congress. The project provides for the allocation of about $400 billion
to combat the pandemic, about $1 trillion to help the population, and
$500 billion to stimulate the economy.

Probably, the dollar will continue to strengthen next week if the
situation on the US government bond market does not change.

Next week, financial market participants will pay attention to the
publication of important macro statistics from China, Australia, the US,
and Canada. However, their focus will be on the meetings of the central
banks of the United States, Great Britain, and Japan. It is also worth
considering that on Sunday March 14, 2021, the US will switch to
daylight saving time. Countries of Europe will switch to daylight saving
time on March 28.

 **Traders should pay attention to the publication of the following
macro indicators:**

 ***during the coming week, new events may be added to the [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) and
/ or some scheduled events may be canceled**

 ****GMT time**

###  **Monday, March 15**

###  **02:00 CNY Retail Sales Index**

This index is published monthly by the National Bureau of Statistics of
China and measures total retail sales and cash receipts. The index is
often considered an indicator of consumer confidence and economic
wellbeing and reflects the health of the retail sector in the near term.
A rise in the index is usually positive for the CNY; a decrease in the
indicator will negatively affect the CNY. The previous value of the
index (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) was +4.6% (after an increase of +8% in the last
months of 2019 and a fall of -20.5% in February 2020). Outlook: Retail
sales in China rose +32% (YoY) in January, suggesting a deepening
recovery from a strong fall in February-March 2020. If the data turns
out to be even better, the CNY will strengthen even more.

###  **Tuesday, March 16**

###  **00:30 AUD Minutes of the March meeting of the RB of Australia**

This document is published two weeks after the meeting and the decision
on the interest rate. If the RBA positively assesses the state of the
labor market in the country, the rate of GDP growth, and also shows a
hawkish attitude towards the inflation forecast in the economy, the
markets regard this as a higher probability of a rate hike at the next
meeting, which is a positive factor for the AUD. The bank's soft
rhetoric regarding inflation puts pressure on the AUD.

Market participants believe that the RBA will not raise interest rates
until 2022. Wages continue to rise slowly and household debt has risen
to an all-time high, which also puts higher interest rates in the longer
term.

"The economic recovery will be uneven and unstable," and "unemployment
may remain high for a long time," said the leaders of the RBA after one
of the last meetings of the bank, promising that "the rate will not rise
until the Central Bank sees progress in moving towards full employment
and stable inflation rates in the 2-3% range”.

According to the head of the RBA Philip Lowe, "there are no serious
arguments in favor of tightening monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) in the short term." In
his opinion, "some time will pass before interest rates rise."

Nevertheless, if the published minutes contain unexpected information
regarding the issues of the RBA's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), the volatility in the
AUD quotes will increase.

###  **12:30 USD Retail sales. Retail control group**

This report (Retail Sales) reflects the total sales of retailers of all
sizes and types. Changes in retail sales are the main indicator of
consumer spending. The report is a leading indicator, and in the future
the data may be greatly revised. A high result strengthens the US
dollar, a low one weakens it. A relative decrease in the indicator may
have a short-term negative impact on the dollar, while an increase in
the indicator will have a positive effect on the USD. In the previous
month (January), the indicator increased by +5.3%, which indicates a
gradual improvement in this sector of the American economy after the
partial lifting of strict quarantine restrictive measures in a number of
states. Forecast for February: -0.5%, which is likely to negatively
affect the USD if the forecast is confirmed.

Retail sales is the leading indicator of consumer spending in the United
States showing changes in retail sales. The Retail Control Group metric
measures volume across the entire retail industry and is used to
calculate price indices for most products. A strong result strengthens
the US dollar, and vice versa, a weak report weakens the dollar. A
slight increase in indicators is unlikely to accelerate the growth of
the dollar. The data is worse than the values ​​of the previous period
(+6.0% in January, -1.9% in December, -0.5% in November, +0.1% in
October, +0.9% in September, -0.3 % in August) may negatively affect the
dollar in the short term. Forecast for February: -1.2%.

###  **Wednesday, March 17**

###  **12:30 CAD Consumer price indices in Canada**

Core CPI from the Bank of Canada reflects the dynamics of the retail
prices of the corresponding basket of goods and services (excluding
fruits, vegetables, gasoline, fuel oil, natural gas, mortgage interest,
intercity transportation, and tobacco products). The inflation target
for the Bank of Canada is in the range of 1-3%. The rise in CPI is a
harbinger of a rate hike and a positive factor for the CAD. Core
Consumer Price Index increased by +1.6% in January 2021, +0.7% in
December 2020, +1.5% in November, +1.0% in October and September (in
annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)). If the data for February turns out to be worse than the
previous values, it will negatively affect the CAD. The data will
strengthen the Canadian dollar better than the previous values. Outlook:
Core CPI rose +1.4% in February (YoY), which is likely to have a
positive impact on the CAD, despite the relative decline in the
indicator.

###   **18:00 USD The Fed's decision on the interest rate. Monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) account. Summary of Economic Projections from the Federal Open
Market Committee**

Following two meetings in March 2020, the Fed sharply lowered the
interest rate (to 0.25% from 1.75% in February), and also announced the
allocation of $700 billion for the purchase of US government bonds and
mortgage-backed securities. Subsequently, the Fed has repeatedly
announced additional measures to support the American economy and inject
cheap liquidity into the financial system. Usually, with the easing of
the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), the national currency becomes cheaper and its
quotations go down.

In 2020, the dollar declined as [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s withdrew funds from defensive
assets buying more risky and profitable assets of the stock market,
which continued to grow despite the threat of a second wave of the
coronavirus epidemic and the associated economic slowdown. The role of
the dollar as a defensive asset was also declining. However, in 2021,
the dollar is strengthening, which is associated with an increase in the
yield of US government bonds, and the Fed has not yet responded to this
in any way.

The rate is widely expected to remain at 0.25% at this meeting.
Nevertheless, during the publication of the decision on the rate,
volatility may sharply increase throughout the financial market,
primarily in the American stock market and in the dollar quotes,
especially if the decision on the rate differs from the forecast or
unexpected statements are received from the Fed leadership.

Powell's comments may affect both short-term and long-term USD trading.
A more hawkish stance on the Fed's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) is seen as positive
and strengthening the US dollar, while a more cautious position is seen
as negative for the USD. Investors are eager to hear Powell's views on
the Fed's future plans for this year.

The FOMC Economic Projections include the Fed's report on inflation and
economic growth over the next 2 years and, just as important, shows the
individual views of FOMC members on interest rates.

###  **18:30 USD FOMC Press Conference**

The press conference of the US Federal Open Market Committee lasts about
an hour. In the first part, the ruling is read, followed by a series of
questions and answers that can increase market volatility. Any hints by
Powell about the possibility of a change in the current monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
will cause an increase in volatility in the dollar quotes and in the
American stock market.

###  **21:45 NZD New Zealand GDP for the 4th quarter**

The release of the data will cause increased volatility in the NZD.
Considering the recent rise in prices for commodities and agricultural
products (especially for dairy products, which is the most important
component of New Zealand exports), as well as the fact that New Zealand
is the least affected by the coronavirus pandemic compared to other
major economies, it is likely that New Zealand's Q4 GDP report will come
out with positive numbers.

GDP is expected to grow by +14.4% in the 4th quarter of 2020 (previous
values ​​of +14%, -11%, -1.2%, +0.1), but decreased by -0.1% in in
annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) (previous values ​​+0.4,% -11.3%, 0%, +1.7%). The data so
far remain inconsistent, although they indicate that the gradual
recovery of the New Zealand economy continues after its fall in the
first half of 2020. The data worse than the forecast will negatively
affect the NZD quotes.

###  **Thursday, March 18**

###  **00:30 AUD Employment rate. Unemployment rate**

Employment rate reflects the monthly change in the number of Australian
citizens employed. The growth of the indicator has a positive impact on
consumer spending, which stimulates economic growth. A high value is
positive for the AUD, while a low value is negative. Forecast: In
February, the number of employed Australian citizens increased (after
falling in April by 607,400, in May 2020 by 264,100 and an increase by
29,100 in January 2021).

Also at the same time, the Australian Bureau of Statistics will publish
a report on the unemployment rate - an indicator that estimates the
ratio of the unemployed population to the total number of able-bodied
citizens. The growth of the indicator indicates the weakness of the
labor market, which leads to a weakening of the national economy. The
decline in the indicator is a positive factor for the AUD. Forecast:
unemployment in Australia in February was at 6.5% (against 6.4% in
January, 6.6% in December, 6.8% in November, 7.0% in October, 6.9% in
September , 6.8% in August, 7.5% in July, 7.4% in June, 5.2% in March,
5.1% in February). In general, the indicators cannot be called positive
yet. However, in other large economies, the labor market has
deteriorated on an even larger scale due to the coronavirus.

The leaders of the RBA have repeatedly stated that, in addition to the
situation in international trade, the Australian economy and the central
bank's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) plans are influenced by indicators of the level
of household debt and expenditures, the growth of workers' wages, as
well as the state of the country's labor market.

In November 2020, the RB of Australia cut its key interest rate by
another 0.15%, to a new record low of 0.1%, due to the coronavirus. In
the opinion of the RBA management, an unemployment rate of 4.5% or lower
is required to raise wages and accelerate inflation to the target range.
Unemployment in the country is not decreasing, and a return of inflation
to the middle of the target range of 2-3% is not even on the distant
horizon.

The AUD is unlikely to react positively to the publication of data from
the country's labor market. If the values ​​of the indicators turn out
to be worse than forecast, the Australian dollar may significantly
decline in the short term. Better-than-forecast data will strengthen AUD
in short-term.

###  **12:00 GBP Bank of England's interest rate decision. Minutes of
the meeting of the Bank of England. Planned volume of asset purchases by
the Bank of England. Monetary Policy Report**

In March (11 March and 19 March) 2020, during extraordinary meetings,
the Bank of England cut its interest rate twice bringing it to the level
of 0.1%, and announced its intention to purchase UK government bonds in
the amount of 200 billion British pounds in an attempt to counteract
economic damage from the coronavirus pandemic. The central bank
announced an increase in its bond portfolio to £645bn, then to £745bn
and to £895bn from £445bn at the time. "The current situation is
completely unprecedented," said Governor of the Bank of England Andrew
Bailey during a press conference after an emergency meeting on March 19.
Bailey said he expects a sharp economic contraction due to the
coronavirus, and the Bank of England is ready to take further stimulus
measures if necessary. “No, we are not done yet,” he said. Based on
these statements by Andrew Bailey, it is fair to expect further actions
from the Bank of England towards easing its monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). It is
possible that at this meeting on March 18, the Bank of England will
again undertake them, increasing the volume of purchases of bonds or
lowering the interest rate. Although, most economists believe that the
Bank of England will refrain from these actions for now.

Also at this time, the minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of
the Bank of England are published with the distribution of votes "for"
and "against" raising / lowering the interest rate. The main risks for
the UK after Brexit are associated with expectations of a slowdown in
the country's economic growth, as well as with a large current account
deficit in the UK balance of payments.

The intrigue about the further actions of the Bank of England remains.
And in the trading of the pound and the FTSE100 index, a lot of trading
opportunities will be there during the publication of the bank's
decision on rates.

Also at the same time, the Bank of England's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) report will
be published, containing an assessment of the economic outlook.
Volatility in the pound quotes may rise sharply. Apart from GDP, one of
the main benchmarks for the Bank of England regarding the prospects for
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) in the UK is the inflation rate. If the tone of the
report is soft, the British stock market will receive support and the
pound will decline. Conversely, the report's tough rhetoric on curbing
inflation, implying an increase in interest rates in the UK, will
strengthen the pound.

###  **Friday, March 19**

###  **00:30 AUD Retail Sales Index**

The Retail Sales Index is published monthly by the Australian Bureau of
Statistics and measures total retail sales. The index is often
considered an indicator of consumer confidence and reflects the health
of the retail sector in the near term. A rise in the index is usually
positive for the AUD; a decrease in the indicator will negatively affect
the AUD. Previous index value (for January) +0.5%. If the data turns out
to be weaker than the previous value, the AUD may sharply decline in the
short term, but if it is above the previous values, the AUD is likely to
strengthen. Forecast: +0.4% in February.

###  **03:00 JPY Bank of Japan's decision on interest rate. Bank of
Japan Press Conference and Monetary Policy Report**

The Bank of Japan will decide on the interest rate. At the moment, the
main rate in Japan is in negative territory at -0.1%. Most likely, the
rate will remain the same. If it is cut and deepens into negative
territory, such a decision will cause a sharp decline in the yen in the
foreign exchange market and an increase in the Japanese stock market. In
any case, during this period of time, a jump in volatility is expected
in trading in the yen and in the Asian financial market.

Since February 2016, the Bank of Japan has kept the deposit rate at
-0.1%. The target yield for 10-year bonds is currently around 0%. In
2020, the Bank of Japan set an annual target for [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/) purchases of 12
trillion yen and expanded its virus-affected business aid program to 110
trillion yen from 75 trillion yen. Under this program, companies can
obtain unsecured loans at zero interest rates. The goal of the program
is to support commercial companies whose bankruptcy rates have
skyrocketed in Japan in recent months, including due to the coronavirus
pandemic. In a recent accompanying statement from the Bank of Japan, it
said that the bank's management will continue to "increase the monetary
base until inflation stays above 2%." “We will not hesitate to take
additional mitigation measures if necessary,” the bank also
traditionally said in a statement.

During the press conference, the head of the Bank of Japan Haruhiko
Kuroda will comment on the bank's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). The Bank of Japan
continues to adhere to its super-soft monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). As Kuroda has
stated on numerous occasions, "it is appropriate for Japan to patiently
continue with its current loose monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)." Markets usually react
noticeably to Kuroda's speeches. Surely, he will again touch upon the
topic of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) during his speech, which will cause an increase
in volatility not only in the yen trade, but also throughout the Asian
and world financial markets.

If the bank's executives decide that Japan's economy is stable and the
momentum of inflation towards the 2% target is not diminishing, they
will refrain from changing [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).

###  **06:00 JPY Press Conference of the Bank of Japan**

During the press conference, head of the Bank of Japan Haruhiko Kuroda
will comment on the bank's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). Despite the measures taken
earlier by the bank to stimulate the Japanese economy, inflation remains
low, production and consumption are falling, which negatively affects
export-oriented Japanese manufacturers. Markets usually react noticeably
to Kuroda's speeches. If he touches on the topic of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
during his speech, volatility will increase not only in the yen trade,
but throughout the Asian and global financial markets.

###  **12:30** **CAD Retail Sales Index**

Retail Sales Index is published monthly by Statistics Canada and
estimates total retail sales. The index is often considered an indicator
of consumer confidence and reflects the health of the retail sector in
the near term. A rise in the index is usually positive for the CAD; a
decrease in the indicator will negatively affect the CAD. The previous
value of the index (for December) was -3.4% after falling in March 2020
by -9.9%, in April - by -25% and growth in May by +18.7%. If the data
for January turns out to be weaker than the forecast of -2.5% and
especially below the previous value, the CAD may sharply decline in the
short term.
