Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 24.03.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

Ripple has completed the corrective wave, and the XRP price should start
rising in an impulse.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

The most recent BTCUSD chart section displays the formation of the
simple down zigzag [A]-[B]-[C], with the first two legs completed
inside. Wave [A] is an impulse, correction [B] is a double zigzag. There
is now forming the initial part of the bearish impulse wave [C], namely
its third sub-wave (3). The market should be declining in the impulse
wave 5 of (3) to a level of 51720.00. One could enter sell trades in the
current situation.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Sell 54006.50, TP 51720.00

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

There continues forming the final wave [Y] of the double zigzag. The
zigzag is composed of three sub-waves (A)-(B)-(C). There is now
unfolding the upward impulse wave (C). Wave 4 is likely to have
completed as a small double zigzag. Therefore, the Ripple price should
be rising in wave 5, which could conclude the entire wave [Y] at a level
of around  0.645. One could open purchases in the current situation.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] today:

Buy 0.541, TP 0.645

* * *

## Elliott wave Ethereum analysis

After the linking wave X finished as a triple zigzag, there has started
a new bearish zigzag [A]-[B]-[C]. The market must have completed the
impulse wave [A] and the [B] correction, which is a double zigzag. There
is now unfolding the initial section of the impulse wave [C]. The market
should be declining in impulse wave 3 of a smaller degree to a level
below 1559.17. One could enter short trades in the current situation.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Sell 1672.99, TP 1559.17
