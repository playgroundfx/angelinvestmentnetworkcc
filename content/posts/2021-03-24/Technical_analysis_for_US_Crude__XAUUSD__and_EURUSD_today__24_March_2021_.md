Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 24.03.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

Gold is trading in a short-term uptrend, the target of which is the
Target Zone 1786 - 1776. At the moment, traders are testing the support
Additional Zone 1730 - 1728.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

Yesterday the Additional Zone and the level of 60.63, which serves as an
entry point No.1, were broken out. The Intermediary Zone and the level
of 59.36, which serves as an entry point No.2 for sale, were broken out
as well. As a result, the lower Target Zone 57.48 - 57.03 was reached.

Now the price is correcting to a short-term downtrend. The target of the
correction is probably the Intermediary Zone 60.04 - 59.78. After the
test of the zone, look for a sell pattern, and when it appears, sell oil
to update yesterday's low.

The alternative scenario suggests the breakout of the Intermediary Zone
and price consolidation higher. In this case, buy oil with a target at
the upper margin zone 62.84 - 62.33.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

Sell according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 60.04 - 59.78.
TakeProfit: 57.35. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

Gold is trading in a short-term uptrend, the target of which is the
Target Zone 1786 - 1776. At the moment, traders are testing the support
Additional Zone 1730 - 1728. There is no traders' reaction that would
allow entering a long trade.

Yesterday support level 1733 was broken out, and a "double top" sell
pattern was formed. Today it is possible to consider selling gold
according to the pattern with the target around level 1700. The trade is
against the trend, so the trading volume should be reduced.

For purchases, it is necessary to break out the resistance level of 1745
and consolidate the price above. In this case, it will be possible to
reach levels 1755 and 1776.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

  1. Aggressive: sell/hold sell trades entered in the zone of level 1733. TakeProfit: 1722, 1700. StopLoss: 1745.

  2. Conservative: buy when level 1745 is broken out. TakeProfit: 1755, 1776. StopLoss: 1733.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

The idea of buying the euro didn't prove to be correct. Yesterday the
support level 1.1881 was broken out, and the trend reversed down. Today
the price is trying to reach the Target Zone 1.1830 - 1.1814.

It is profitable to look for euro sales on correction at strong
resistance levels. Additional Zone 1.1877 - 1.1873 and Intermediary Zone
1.1921 - 1.1913 are strong resistances today. Wait for the test of
levels and look for a sell signal with a target at the day's low.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

  1. Sell according to the pattern in Additional Zone 1.1877 - 1.1873. TakeProfit: 1.1838. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. Sell according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 1.1921 - 1.1913. TakeProfit: 1.1838. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.
