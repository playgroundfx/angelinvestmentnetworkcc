Economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the week 23.08.2021 – 29.08.2021Jana Kane

##  **Review of the main events of the Forex economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the
next trading week (23.08.2021 – 29.08.2021)**

Despite the partial profit-taking in long positions in the dollar by
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s at the end of the week, it still closed the last week with a
significant increase.

The DXY dollar index, which tracks the dollar against a basket of 6
major currencies, gained more than 1% over the past week, exceeding
March local highs near 93.47. The DXY has not been at current levels
since mid-November 2020.

The main US stock indexes fell by the end of the past week. This is how
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s reacted to the publication on Wednesday of the minutes of the
July Fed meeting. Although, in the ranks of the Fed's management, there
is no consensus on the decision to start curtailing the asset purchase
program, the controversial position of the regulator disappointed
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s. Some of the Fed leaders, as follows from the minutes, believe
that it is too early to start curtailing incentives now, at least until
the spring of 2022, while others of them are in favor of starting the
curtailment of the program by the end of this year.

In addition to the minutes of the US Federal Reserve, stock indices are
under pressure from the high rate of spread of the delta coronavirus
strain.

At the same time, many economists expect further strengthening of the US
dollar on expectations of the imminent curtailment of the Fed's QE
program.

Next week, financial market participants will pay attention to the
publication of important macro statistics from Germany, Great Britain,
New Zealand, the US, and Australia. However, special attention will be
paid to the course of the annual economic forum organized by the Fed in
Jackson Hole, Wyoming, which will be attended by representatives of the
world's leading central banks and economists. Statements from
representatives of central banks can have a significant impact on
national currencies. On August 27, the Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will
speak at the Jackson Hole symposium on monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). Undoubtedly, the
main item on the agenda for market participants is the likelihood and
timing of the start of curtailing of the Fed's stimulating [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) this
or next year.

 ***during the coming week, new events may be added to the [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) and
/ or some scheduled events may be canceled**

 ****GMT time**

###  **Monday, August 23**

###  **07:30 EUR Germany Manufacturing PMI by Markit Economics
(preliminary release). Composite PMI by Markit Economics (preliminary
release)**

Manufacturing PMI is an important indicator of the business environment
and the overall health of the German economy. This sector of the economy
forms a significant part of Germany's GDP. A result above 50 is seen as
positive and strengthens the EUR, one below 50 as negative for the euro.
Forecast for August (preliminary release): 65.0.

Previous monthly values: 65.9, 65.1, 64.4, 66.2, 66.6, 60.7, 57.1, 58.3,
57.8, which indicates an acceleration of business activity in this
sector of the German economy after slowing down in 2020 due to the
coronavirus pandemic. The growth of the indicator above the previous
values ​​will support the euro (in the short term). The data worse than
the forecast will have a negative impact on the euro.

Composite PMI is an important indicator of the business environment and
the overall health of the German economy. A result above 50 is seen as
positive and strengthens the EUR, one below 50 as negative for the euro.
August forecast (preliminary release): 62.0 against 62.4, 60.1, 56.2,
55.8, 57.3, 51.1, 50.8, 52.0, 51.7 in prior months. The publication of
this indicator with the specified expected value is likely to support
the euro in the short term. The data worse than the forecast and below
the value of 50.0 will have a negative impact on the euro.

###  **08:00 EUR Eurozone Composite Manufacturing PMI by Markit
Economics (preliminary release)**

The Eurozone Manufacturing PMI is an important indicator of the health
of the entire European economy. A result above 50 is seen as positive
and strengthens the EUR, one below 50 as negative for the euro. August
forecast (preliminary release): 59.7 against 60.2, 59.5, 57.1, 53.8,
53.2, 62.5, 48.8, 47.8, 49.1, 45. 3 in previous months, which is likely
to have a positive effect on the euro. If the data turns out to be worse
than the forecast, the euro may drop sharply in the short term.

###  **08:30 GBP UK Services PMI by Markit Economics (preliminary
release)**

The UK Services PMI is an important indicator of the health of the UK
economy. The service sector employs most of the UK's working-age
population and accounts for approximately 75% of GDP. Financial services
continue to be the most important part of the service industry. If the
data turns out to be worse than the forecast and the previous value, the
pound is likely to drop sharply in the short term. The data better than
the forecast and the previous value will have a positive impact on the
pound. At the same time, a result above 50 is seen as positive and
strengthens the GBP, one below 50 - as negative for the GBP.

Previous values ​​of the indicator: 59.6 in July, 62.4 in June, 62.9 in
May, 61.0 in April, 56.3 in March, 49.5 in February, 39.5 in January
2021 after falling to levels of 29.0 in May, 13.4 in April, 34.5 in
March 2020. Preliminary forecast for August: 59.0.

###  **22:45 NZD Retail Sales (Q2)**

The Retail Sales Report is published by the Bureau of Statistics New
Zealand. Changes in retail sales are generally considered an indicator
of consumer spending. In general, a high reading is a positive factor
for the NZD, while a low reading is a negative factor.

In Q1 2021, retail sales rose +2.5% after falling -14.8% in Q2 2020 due
to quarantine restrictions due to Covid-19. The NZD will strengthen if
the data is better than previous values. Weak values will negatively
impact the NZD.

###  **Tuesday, August 24**

No important macro statistics planned to be released.

###  **Wednesday, August 25**

###  **12:30 USD Durable goods orders. Capital goods orders (ex defense
and aviation)**

This indicator reflects the value of orders received by manufacturers of
durable goods and capital goods (capital goods are durable commodities
used to produce durable goods and services) involving large investments.
Commodities produced in the defense and aviation sectors of the US
economy are not included in this indicator. A strong result strengthens
the USD. Previous values ​​of the indicator "durable goods orders":
+0.9% in June, +2.3% in May, -1.3% in April, + 1% in March, -1.2% in
February, +3.4% in January 2021.

Previous values ​​of the indicator "capital goods orders ex defense and
aviation": +0.7% in June, +0.1% in May, +2.2% in April, +1% in March,
-0.9% in February, +0.6% in January 2021.

In theory, the relative growth of the indicator has a positive effect on
the dollar; the market reaction to its negative value may be negative
for the dollar in the short term. Data worse than the previous value
will also negatively affect the dollar quotes.

Forecast for July: -0.4% (durable goods orders), +0.5% (capital goods
orders ex defense and aviation).

It seems that the growth of indicators has slowed down, although it
continues after their recovery in previous months from a strong drop in
March and April 2020, which should have a positive effect on the dollar
quotes. Better-than-expected data will also have a positive impact on
the dollar.

###  **Thursday, August 26**

Annual Economic Symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, organized and
sponsored by the Fed. At the symposium, representatives of world central
banks and economists discuss issues of the world economy and speak out
on the prospects for monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of central banks. Statements by
representatives of central banks may have a significant impact on
national currencies, including the US dollar exchange rate. The degree
of this influence will depend on the tone of the statements of the
representatives of the central banks.

###  **12:30 USD US Annual GDP for Q2 (second estimate)**

GDP data is one of the key indicators (along with data on the labor
market and inflation) for the Fed in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of its monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).
Strong result strengthens the US dollar; weak GDP report negatively
affects the US dollar. In the previous 1st quarter, GDP grew by +6.4%,
in the 4th quarter - by +4.3% after growing by +33.4% in the 3rd quarter
of 2020, and after falling by -31. 4% in Q2 and -5.0% in Q1 2020.

If the data points to a decline in GDP in the 2nd quarter, then the
dollar will come under pressure. The positive data on GDP will support
the dollar and the American stock indices, although they are already
mostly priced in. The preliminary forecast for the 2nd quarter of 2021
was +8.2%, and the actual value was +6.5%.

###  **Friday, August 27**

 **Annual Economic Symposium in Jackson Hole**

###  **01:30 AUD Retail Sales Index**

Retail Sales Index is published monthly by the Australian Bureau of
Statistics and measures total retail sales. The index is often
considered an indicator of consumer confidence and reflects the health
of the retail sector in the near term. A rise in the index is usually
positive for the AUD; a decrease in the indicator will negatively affect
the AUD. The previous value of the index (for June) was -1.8%. If the
data turns out to be weaker than the previous value, the AUD may sharply
decline in the short term, but if it's above the previous values, the
AUD is likely to strengthen.

###  **14:00 USD The Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's speech**

Jerome Powell is to speak at the Jackson Hole Symposium on monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). The main question for market participants is the likelihood and
timing of the start of curtailing the stimulating [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the Fed this
year or next.

Powell's comments may affect short-term USD trading. A more hawkish
stance on the Fed's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) is seen as positive and strengthens
the US dollar, while a more cautious one is viewed as negative for the
USD.

If he makes unexpected statements about the Fed's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), the
volatility in trading in the financial markets could increase
dramatically.
