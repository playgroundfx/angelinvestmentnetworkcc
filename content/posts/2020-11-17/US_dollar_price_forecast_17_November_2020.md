Dollar doesn’t like Tesla. Forecast as of 17.11.2020Dmitri Demidenko

The [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) about coronavirus vaccines allowed the [S&P 500][1] to hit all-
time highs, supporting the risk appetite and sending the [EURUSD][2] up.
How long will it last? Let us discuss the Forex outlook and make up a
trading plan.

##  ** **Weekly** **US dollar** **fundamental forecast****

We should never forget 2020. However, financial markets seem to have
forgotten it. Despite Wall Street experts' forecasts, suggesting the
market turmoil following the US presidential election, the [S&P 500][1]
hits fresh highs. The US stocks are again rising amid the [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) about the
COVID-19 vaccine. This time, Moderna offers a vaccine that demonstrated
95% efficiency. This vaccine performs better than the products developed
by Pfizer and BioNTech. However, the stock index featured a weaker
growth, which suggests the momentum exhaust and the [EURUSD][2] rally is
limited.

The higher rises the [S&P 500][1], the more experts talk about a
correction. The epidemiological situation in the USA is deteriorating.
The number of hospitalizations has reached a record high of 73,000. Over
the last week, 1129 people died on average, which is the highest rate
since August. Besides, 53 Reuters experts out of 57 believe that the
coronavirus is the US economy's major problem, rather than the
uncertainty about the ultimate voting results.

I suppose these two matters are related. Joe Biden says even more people
will die from COVID-19 unless he and the new US administration soon take
up their duties. Donald Trump continues a series of controversial
tweets. Trump tweets Biden ‘won because the election was rigged’ and
then he writes ‘We will win.’

So, the USA's epidemiological situation is tough; Trump refuses to
concede and rejects the voting result. These are the arguments for a
soon [S&P 500][1] correction down. Another bearish factor is the
uncertainty around the new fiscal stimulus package. Old financial aid
programs expire on January 1. According to Deutsche Bank, the end of the
programs will reduce consumer incomes by $150 billion in the first
quarter of 2021, pressing the GDP down by 1%.

On the other hand, the US stock buyers have some arguments for the rally
continuation. The Fed provides huge volumes of cheap liquidity,
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s hope for a soon recovery of the US economy amid the
introduction of COVID-19 vaccines. Furthermore, Tesla stock is to join
the [S&P 500][1] index in December. Since the beginning of 2020, the
[S&P 500][1] has been 12% up, which is quite an impressive performance
considering the pandemic. However, the [Nasdaq 100][3] has been 38% up
due to the Tesla company. The [S&P 500][1] should catch up.

### Weekly [EURUSD][2] trading plan

I deliberately focus on the US stock market in my euro-dollar analytics.
The US stock indexes determine the global risk appetite, which is the
key driver for all dollar pairs, including the [EURUSD][2]. If the euro
breaks out the resistance at $1.1865-$1.188, it should continue the
rally towards $1.1955-$1.1965. If the EURUSD bounces down from the
resistance, the correction should continue down to 1.18 and 1.1765.
