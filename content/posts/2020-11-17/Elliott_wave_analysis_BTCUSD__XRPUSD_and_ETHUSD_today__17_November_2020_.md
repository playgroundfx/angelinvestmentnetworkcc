Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 17.11.2020Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I suggest entry signals
to trade each cryptocurrency.

The three cryptocurrency pairs analyzed in the article are forming
bullish impulses. The prices should be rising to the levels indicated
below.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

 ****

The Bitcoin continues forming the bullish linking wave [X] as a double
zigzag (W)-(X)-(Y). There is now forming the final leg of the upward
wave (Y), which is a simple zigzag A-B-C, i.e. the C wave is unfolding.
Four elements out of five have completed within the C wave. Within the
impulse wave [5], the corrective wave (4) has completed and the price is
rising in the impulse wave (5). Wave (5) should complete around the
level of 17300.00. One could enter long positions.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 16668.75, TP 17300.00

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

 ****

The Ripple market continues forming the upward corrective wave (B) as a
simple zigzag A-B-C. Wave A is a leading diagonal [1]-[2]-[3]-[4]-[5],
as wave [4] exceeded wave [1]. The down corrective wave B is a triple
zigzag. There is now forming the bullish impulse wave C that is composed
of the sub-waves [1]-[2]-[3]-[4]-[5]. Shortly, the price should be
rising in the sub-wave (5) to a level of 0.300. The corrective wave (B)
will reach 76.4% Fibonacci of the (A) impulse at this level.

### Trading plan for **[XRPUSD][2]** today:

Buy 0.291, TP 0.300

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

 ****

In the two-hour ETHUSD price chart, there is forming the bullish impulse
wave within the zigzag-shaped wave (Y). The first four legs have
completed, and the market is now running up in wave [5]. The down
corrective wave (4) must have completed recently as a simple zigzag
a-b-c. There is now forming the initial element of the final wave (5).
Therefore, the market should be rising to a level of 507.00. One could
enter purchases.

### Trading plan for  **[ETHUSD][3] **today:

Buy 463.01, TP 507.00
