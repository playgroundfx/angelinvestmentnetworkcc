Gold misses multi-polarity. Forecast as of 17.11.2020Dmitri Demidenko

What will the world be like after the COVID-19? What will the US-China
trade relations be like under Joe Biden? The answers to these questions
will determine the [XAUUSD][1] trend. Let us discuss gold prospects and
make up a trading plan.

##  **Fundamental gold forecast for a year**

In 2020, the main factor of forex pricing is pandemic. The victory over
the pandemic in 2021 by means of vaccination could take the world back
to multi-polarity. There again would be such important factors as
economic expansion, monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), and international trade. The first
sign of higher importance of factors other than the coronavirus has
become the gold’s reaction to Donald Trump's ban on American companies'
purchases of certain Chinese securities. The ban resulted in sell-offs
in the Chinese corporate debt market and sent the Treasury yield down,
supporting the gold price rise to $1900 per ounce.

The improvement in the US-China trade relations is the second crucial
factor for [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s following the victory over the COVID-19. Although
the Chinese see Joe Biden as a better partner than wild and
unpredictable Trump, the US [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) towards China could remain tough.
Biden has already announced that the US allies need to negotiate to
establish rules for international trade to counter China's growing
influence.

Supposing that the vaccines bring the world to normal life, the world
economy is recovering and the US-China trade relations don’t deteriorate
at least (at best, Joe Biden could cancel the tariffs imposed by Trump),
gold should be between a rock and a hard place. On the one hand, the
growth of the global PMI and the rally of Treasury yields will press
down the [XAUUSD][1]. On the other hand, the Treasury rates affect gold
prices, which you could see on November 9 when gold had the worst [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/)
crash since August. Goldman Sachs has lowered the gold price forecast
for 2021 from $1950 to $1825 per ounce, as analysts expect the recovery
of global GDP.

However, the above scenario could suggest the US dollar drop, which is
an obvious bullish factor for the [XAUUSD][1]. Citigroup believes that
the USD should be 20% down next year. The company suggests the situation
of the 2000s should repeat next year. In the 2000s, Chine joined the
WTO, which accelerated international trade, strengthened the euro, and
weakened the greenback. The median-forecast of Bloomberg experts
suggests the USD should be 3% down in 2021. The worst yearly drop of the
USD index was 18.5% in 1985.

I believe that this scenario doesn’t consider such a factor as the
difference between the US GDP and global growth. If the US economy
recovers soon, the dollar could stabilize. In addition to the Treasury
yield growth, the dollar strengthening will suggest selling gold towards
$1800 and $1770. Otherwise, if the euro-area economy performs better,
the [XAUUSD][1] will tend to consolidate in the range of 1800-1900. The
escalation of the US-China trade war will hinder global economic
expansion, strengthening the dollar and sending the gold price down to
$1700-$1750.
