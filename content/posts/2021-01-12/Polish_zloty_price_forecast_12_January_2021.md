Annoying Polish zloty. Forecast as of 12.01.2021Dmitri Demidenko

The strengthening of the US dollar made some [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s doubt the bright
future of developing countries' currencies, including the Polish zloty.
[USDPLN][1] has started to rise, but is the growth temporary? Let us
discuss the Forex outlook and make up a USDPLN trading plan.

## Fundamental zloty forecast for six months

What is worse for a developing country's currency: rising US Treasury
yields or its own central bank's dissatisfaction with currency's
excessively high rate? The zloty, which successfully started 2021, took
a few steps back and lost all gains amid a rapid rally in the rates of
the American debt market and the National Bank of Poland's
interventions. The President of the National Bank of Poland, Adam
Glapinski, said that even though the current level of the main interest
rate of 0.1% is most suitable for the economy, the central bank may
reduce it in the first quarter.

The dovish stance came as a surprise to both [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s and the Polish
tax authorities. The latter have repeatedly expressed concern that lower
borrowing costs will hurt the banking system's profits and other
interest-sensitive sectors of the economy and lead to a reduction in
budget revenues. The National Bank needs to find a common language with
the government and to establish communication. In particular, according
to Citigroup, the volume of foreign exchange interventions in December
amounted to $6.7 billion. At the same time, rumors circulate in the
market that with their help, the central bank increased the value of
gold and foreign exchange reserves at the end of the year and thus
increased profits, which would then go to the budget.

The critical area for Adam Glapinski and his colleagues is 4.45-4.5 on
[EURPLN][2]. This is not surprising. The lion's share of Poland's
exports goes to the eurozone, and the strengthening of the zloty against
the euro is an extremely undesirable thing for Polish companies
operating in the foreign market. However, the National Bank can succeed
at someone else's expense. The rapid rise in US Treasury yields has
pressed down all EM assets, including their currencies.

Encouraged by Joe Biden's promise to invest trillions of dollars in the
economy, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s began to rely on an increase in the emission of US
Treasury bonds, dumping existing securities in the hope of acquiring new
ones at auctions. As a result, the profitability is growing and the EM
currencies promoted at the end of 2020 fell into disgrace for a while. I
do not think that the rally in treasury rates will continue at the same
speed as before. As [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) shows, if the main driver is the supply of
debt, then the rise in yields is temporary. The pause will weaken the
greenback and restore [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s' interest in EM assets.

Zloty looks like an attractive investment tool. The epidemiological
situation in the country is better than in many European countries and
the United States. The victory over the pandemic and the rapid growth of
the eurozone's GDP, Poland's main trading partner, will catalyze the
[USDPLN][1] trigger.

### [USDPLN][1] trading plan for six months

In my opinion, the current growth in treasury yields, as well as the
associated strengthening of the US dollar and the weakening of emerging
markets' currencies, will be short-lived. In this regard, it makes sense
to sell [USDPLN][1] on a rise to 3.785 or on a breakout of support at
3.693-3.698 with targets at 3.55 and 3.44.
