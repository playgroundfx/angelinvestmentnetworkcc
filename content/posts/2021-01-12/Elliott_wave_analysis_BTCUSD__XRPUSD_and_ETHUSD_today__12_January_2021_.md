Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 12.01.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

Bitcoin continues forming the upward impulse wave. Ripple is shaping the
initial element of the bullish impulse; Ethereum has started developing
the bearish zigzag.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

The BTCUSD market continues running up in the impulse wave 5, with the
final leg developing inside. The most recent chart section displays the
bullish impulse (5) of [5], which is composed of five waves 1-2-3-4-5.
The zigzag-shaped bearish correction 4 seems to have completed, and so
the price should be rising in wave 5. The market should be rising to a
level of 50000.00. Therefore, one could consider entering long trades in
the current situation.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 35094.00 TP 50000.00

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

The Ripple market is developing a bullish trend, which has started after
the bearish correction B completed. There is forming a five-wave
impulse. The first wave of this impulse, impulse wave (1), must have
finished. Wave 1 is a leading diagonal, correction 4 is a contracting
triangle. The price is now declining in the down corrective wave (2).
The market could be declining to a level of 0.200. After that, the
Ripple price should again start rising.

### Trading plan for **[XRPUSD][2]** today:

Sell 0.284, TP 0.200

* * *

## Elliott wave Ethereum analysis

The ETHUSD market must have completed the upward impulse wave C. The
price is now declining, forming a new bearish trend. There is likely to
be developing the beginning of a simple zigzag [A]-[B]-[C]. The impulse
wave [A] could have finished by half, so the price should continue
declining to a level of 784.00. Next, the market should turn up and
start rising in the corrective wave [B]. One could enter short trades in
the current situation.

### Trading plan for  **[ETHUSD][3] **today:

Sell 1062.84, TP 784.00
