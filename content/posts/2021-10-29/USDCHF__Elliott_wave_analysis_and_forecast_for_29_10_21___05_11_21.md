USDCHF: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 29.10.21 – 05.11.21Alex
Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 0.9271 with a target of 0.8924 – 0.8766.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
0.9271 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 0.9368 –
0.9506.

 **Analysis:** Daily chart: apparently, the first wave of larger degree
(1) of 5 is formed, a correction is completed as the second wave (2) of
5, and the third wave (3) of 5 has started developing, with wave 1 of
(3) formed inside. On the H4 chart, a local correction has formed as the
second wave 2 of (3), and the third wave 3 of (3) is unfolding.
Apparently, wave i of 3 is developing on the H1 chart, with wave (iii)
of i forming inside. If the presumption is correct, the pair will
continue to drop to the levels of 0.8924 – 0.8766. The level of 0.9271
is critical in this scenario. Its breakout will allow the pair to
continue rising to the levels of 0.9368 – 0.9506.
