Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 29.10.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

The development of a short-term oil downtrend continues.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

The development of a short-term oil downtrend continues. Yesterday,
prices entered the zone of good sell prices 82.91 - 81.38. Look for a
sell pattern in the aforementioned zone with the first target around
level 80.27. The main target for shorts is the lower Target Zone 79.86 -
79.35.

The short-term trend will reverse up if the Intermediary Zone and level
82.91 are broken out. In this case, look for oil purchases with a target
around October 25 high and the upper Target Zone of 85.72 - 85.21.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

Sell according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 82.91 - 82.66.
TakeProfit: 80.27, Target Zone 79.86 - 79.35. StopLoss: according to the
pattern rules.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

The short-term gold uptrend continues. The October 22 high and the Gold
Zone serve as targets for longs. The borders of the Gold Zone are at
levels 1818 - 1816. Today look for purchases in the zone of 1803 - 1793
according to the pattern.

If level 1793 is broken out and the price consolidates below the level,
look for gold sales with the target in the lower Target Zone 1776 -
1772. In this case, the short-term trend will reverse down.

###

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

Buy at the level of 1793. TakeProfit: Gold Zone 1818 - 1816. StopLoss:
1787.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

Yesterday, the short-term euro uptrend continued. As a result, level
1.1664 was reached. This level has been broken out. The next target is
the upper Target Zone 1.1718 - 1.1700.

I recommend looking for new purchases on correction at strong levels.
The first significant support is the broken level of 1.1664. The second
support is the Additional Zone 1.1648 - 1.1643. The trend border is
shifting to the levels 1.1604 - 1.1595.

In the current situation, it is unprofitable to look for shorts on euro.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

  1. Buy according to the pattern at the level of 1.1665. TakeProfit: Target Zone 1.1718 - 1.1700. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. Buy according to the pattern in Additional Zone 1.1648 - 1.1643. TakeProfit: Target Zone 1.1718 - 1.1700. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.
