EURUSD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 29.10.21 – 05.11.21Alex
Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 1.1909 with a target of 1.1488 – 1.1287.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
1.1909 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 1.2090 –
1.2269.

 **Analysis:** Daily chart: the first wave of larger degree 1 of (3) is
formed, and a downside correction continues forming as wave 2 of (3),
with wave c of 2 unfolding as part of it. Apparently, the third wave of
smaller degree (iii) of c is completed, and a local correction continues
developing as wave (iv) of с on the H4 chart. Wave c of (iv) is
presumably unfolding on the H1 chart. If the presumption is correct, the
pair will resume falling to 1.1488 – 1.1287 once the wave c of (iv) is
completed. The level of 1.1909 is critical in this scenario. Its
breakout will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 1.2090
– 1.2269.
