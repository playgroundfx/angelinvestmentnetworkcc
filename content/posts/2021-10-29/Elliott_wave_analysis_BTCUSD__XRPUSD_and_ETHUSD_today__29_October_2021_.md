Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 29.10.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

Bitcoin and Ethereum have completed corrective waves. The price should
soon be rising in impulse waves.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

The BTCUSD market is forming the bullish impulse 1-2-3-4-5, where the
first three sub-waves have finished; the bearish correction 4 looks also
completed as a simple zigzag [A]-[B]-[C], where [A] and [C] are impulses
and sub-wave [B] is a zigzag-shaped correction. Therefore, the price
should be rising in the final, fifth, sub-waves of the impulse to a
level above 63600.00 in the next few days.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 61693.00, TP 63600.00

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

The XRPUSD market is forming the linking upwave X as a triple zigzag
[W]-[X]-[Y]-[X]-[Z], where sub-waves [W]-[X]-[Y]-[X] have finished, and
the final motive wave [Z] is unfolding as a simple zigzag (A)-(B)-(C).
The first impulse wave (A) could end at a level around 1.102. An
approximate trajectory of the Ripple price movement is outlined in the
chart.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] **** today:

Buy 1.074, TP 1.102

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

The ETHUSD market is forming corrective wave B, with the final wave [C]
unfolding inside as an impulse composed of five sub-waves
(1)-(2)-(3)-(4)-(5). Corrective wave (4) has recently completed as a
zigzag A-B-C. The price is now rising in impulse (5), composed of sub-
waves 1-2-3-4-5 of a smaller degree. The price should be moving in two
small sub-waves 4 and 5 to a level of 4590.00.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Buy 4384.07, TP 4590.00
