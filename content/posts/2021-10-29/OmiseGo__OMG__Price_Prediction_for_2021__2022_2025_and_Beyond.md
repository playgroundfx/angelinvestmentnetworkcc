OMG Price Prediction: What’s the Power of OMG?Jana Kane

OmiseGo is a scaling solution launched by Jun Hasegawa and Ezra Don
Harinsut in 2013. Omise, the company behind it, is a payment gateway and
offers financial services in Thailand, Japan, and Singapore. Omise’s
main line of business is processing online payments, but there is
actually more to it. Today, we’ll explore OmiseGO's full profile.

OmiseGo is not just any payment management service; it has made quite a
few partners with large companies over the years. One of these large
companies is McDonald’s in Thailand, for example. On June 6, 2020,
OmiseGo rebranded and transitioned to the mainnet. From that moment on,
it was called the OMG Network.

The article covers the following subjects:

Since its inception, OMG Network (OMG) has always been [in the top 100
on Coinmarketcap][1]. That’s reason enough to write an article about
OMG. In this article, we will discuss how the OMG Network price is
currently going, the reason for the price direction, and expert OMG
price predictions and forecasts for the future. Let's dive into why you
should also have OmiseGo in your crypto portfolio! So, are you ready?
Let's go!

## About OmiseGO

OmiseGo originated from the company that already handled many
transactions in Asia under the name Omise. OmiseGo is Omise's [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/)
solution. So, the idea is that OmiseGo is a similar solution for intra-
bank payments, comparable to the SWIFT network we know.

Do you want to transfer a payment from one country to another in the
continent of Asia? Then you can get ready and expect to pay major fees.
In particular, expats who work in another country often want to transfer
money to family members who have stayed behind. And that is not so easy.

First of all, such a family must have a comparable bank account in order
to be able to complete the transaction at all. In addition, substantial
amounts are charged to actually facilitate this. These costs do not make
the often-dire financial situation of these families any better. Every
cent in costs that then has to be paid is actually too much.

OmiseGo will facilitate such transactions over the OmiseGo [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/).
The platform launched the OMG cryptocurrency, which is an ERC20 token.
This means that OmiseGO is a [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) on the Ethereum [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/). OMG
uses Ethereum for its workflows but also develops a symbiotic
relationship with the network, which acts as a scalable solution. They
are working on tools with which software developers can create their own
software wallets. These wallets then run on the OmiseGo [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) and
can hold many different fiat and cryptocurrencies. Consider, for
example, the euro, the US dollar, and also Bitcoin and local currencies
from the individual Asian countries. Of course, the OmiseGo token itself
should not be missing: the coin with the best name ever invented, the
OMG coin.

The network is aimed at achieving extremely low fees so that large
groups of people from the poorer parts of the world can use the network
to participate in financial traffic at a decent cost.

### The Power of OMG

OMG Network ensures that everyone can get a wallet. You can see this
wallet as your own bank account on the [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/). With this wallet, you
have access to the financial market. With the OMG Network wallet, you
can buy products, transfer money, and put many different currencies on
the wallet. OmiseGO is an open-source [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) platform whose main
slogan is “Unbank the Banked.” OmiseGO is expected to become a direct
competitor to traditional banking institutions.

You can transfer from one [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) to another by using these wallet
coins. It also makes it possible to transfer money between [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/)s
and traditional payment providers such as VISA and SWIFT.

Now there are several wallets that facilitate this. What makes OMG
Network stronger than the rest is that OMG Network originated from the
Omise company. This company has years of experience with online
payments.

Because they originated from Omise, they benefit from brand awareness
and the network. As a result, OMG Network already has a number of
partnerships with large companies. McDonald's Thailand has already
partnered with them.

Ayudhya and SMBC are two major Japanese banks that have invested in OMG
Network. If these partnerships grow, this can be very favorable for the
OMG course expectations.

## Omisego & McDonald’s

[OmiseGo has entered into a partnership with McDonald’s in 2017][2]. In
concrete [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/), this means that in Thailand, for example, every
McDonald’s restaurant accepts the OMG coin. That may not sound very
impressive, but if you assume that there are 70 million people in
Thailand who can suddenly all pay cheaper at McDonald’s, then this can
have a significant positive impact on the OmiseGo philosophy.

## OMG in 2021 and Some History

Quite an impressive result, that's a decent summary of the OmiseGo ICO
held in 2017. In June, the ICO was opened to [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s for a month, and
OmiseGo managed to rake in a whopping $25 million within a month.

That the ICO not only provided a nice amount for OmiseGo itself but was
also a top investment for everyone who joined is evident from the price
development. No less than a return of 1500% has been recorded. During
the ICO, 1 OMG cost just under 23 cents. Today, the same OMG is , with
much of the growth happening over the course of 2021. That is an
impressive result!

A major development for the protocol is the rebranding of OmiseGO to OMG
Foundation, which happened in June 2021. Along with that, Enya,
OmiseGO’s provider of decentralized infrastructure, announced the
upcoming Boba Network. The goal of this new solution is to reduce gas
fees and increase transaction throughput.

The rollout of the Boba Network closely tracked the rise in the OMG
price. Existing OMG holders will get a one-to-one drop of BOBA tokens
when the developers bridge the two networks.

As it always goes with cryptocurrency projects, the price differs greatly. That is why it does not make much sense to keep an eye on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) [OMG exchange rate][3] (except if you’re a scalper trader, of course); tomorrow, this will be different. The current OMG rate can be found below:    

## OMG Expert Price Predictions for 2021-2022

What is OmiseGo going to be worth by the end of this year and throughout
the next year? We’ll be looking at all kinds of predictions - from the
most conservative to the most optimistic.

Trading Beasts is not overly excited about OMG in 2021. They expect the
average price to drop to $11, only briefly reaching the maximum of $14.

As for 2022, the average price might be marginally higher than in 2021.
The year might start at an average price point of $11.9, surpassing the
$12 mark shortly after, and finish the year at $13.

According to Wallet Investor, the average price of OMG will be $14-15 in
November and December 2021. The minimum price for the period might be
$11, and the maximum price might be $17-18.

At the beginning of 2022, the price is expected to be at $15 (minimum
$12.6, maximum $18). By the middle of the year, it might rise to $18
(minimum $15, maximum $20). Finally, by the end, OMG might reach an
average price of $21 (minimum $18, maximum $23).

Digital Coin Price is by far the most optimistic source. As for the end
of 2021, the source sees a rate near $20.4. The OMG might go into 2022
with an average price of $22. However, as we move on deeper into 2022,
this platform doesn’t make huge claims. The year is predicted to be full
of ups and downs in the $22-$28 range.

These estimates show three things:

  1. There is a lot of confidence in the technology the OMG Network is using and the team that’s developing it. It’s making important connections with real-world businesses and is developing some cool new technology, too.

  2. Many top-100 [cryptocurrency price](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/cryptocurrency-price/)s are expected to go up across the market in 2022.

  3. Crypto experts, more often than not, predict that the price of OMG will go up!

Trading Beasts is hitting the same pessimistic tone. They don't see OMG
going over $18 in 2023. The average price of the token might be around
$13-14, which is a downfall compared to its performance in 2021.

In 2024, we see a slight increase. The year might start at the $14.5
mark and finish very close to the $16 mark.

Experts at Wallet Investor believe that OMG will start 2023 trading at
$20 on average ($17 minimum, $22 maximum). By June, the value might
appreciate to $22 ($20 minimum, $25 maximum). And by the end of 2023,
the token is expected to add another $3 to its price and reach $25.

The dynamics for 2024 might be similar:

  * January: average price of $25 ($23 minimum, $28 maximum)

  * June: average price of $28 ($25 minimum, $30 maximum)

  * December: average price of $30 ($27 minimum, $33 maximum)

Once again, we have Digital Coin Price expecting OMG to trade on a much
higher level. The price dynamics for 2023 are rocky, with a slight
decrease by the end of the year. The poorest-performing month might be
September ($25.60), and the best-performing month might be January (over
$35).

As for 2024, OMG might also fluctuate, possibly changing directions
every other month. The highest point of 2024 might be slightly over $42
in June and December, and the lowest points might be close to $31 in
January and slightly above $33 in August.

## OMG Price Prediction for 2025-2030 by Crypto Experts

In the long term, the price of OMG might continue hitting new heights.
OMG's idea is very promising. If the OMG Network team succeeds in
turning their plans into reality by 2025-2030, it could become a big boy
in the crypto world. For example, one of the goals is to expand the
partnership network. If OMG Network enters into more partnerships with
large companies and connects bankless people, the project will have a
huge chance of success. It is good to know that they have always kept to
the deadlines so far.

We must not forget that there are two billion households that do not
have a bank. In Southeast Asia alone, there are 438 million people
without a bank. OMG Network can be the solution for these people. With
OMG Network’s solution, you don’t have to deal with middlemen charging
high transaction fees. Instead, you can easily transfer different
currencies within seconds.

There is, therefore, a huge market open for OMG Network that makes the
potential of this cryptocurrency incredibly large. In addition to
transferring money to, for example, family, it can also be used to pay
when companies join OMG Network.

Wallet Investor posted a positive prediction for 2025 and 2026. Over the
course of these two years, the average price might see an increase from
$31 to $40 and above.

Digital Coin Price believes that the price change from 2025 to 2028 will
be tremendous. The average market price for OMG might be in the $36-$48
range. Fast forward to 2028: this source claims that the price will go
over $60 and even $70.

PricePrediction has a lot of faith in OMG. They expect the price to make
a massive jump from $64 in 2025 to over $401 in 2030. Bear in mind that
it’s difficult to make predictions 5-10 years ahead, but what’s clear is
that the majority of experts envision a very positive future for the
project.

## OMG Technical Analysis

Let's start our [OMGUSD][3] technical analysis on the monthly price
chart.

The chart above suggests that ex-[OmiseGo][4] has been moving up in a
broad range since 2020. At the same time, there's strong support at
around 3.30 USD that bears have failed to break through in the past
three months. That level is marked with a red line.

Since the OMGUSD price chart is at the lower range limit, a local
bullish trend with a price target of 12 US dollars suggests itself in
the long run.

### OMG Forecast For Next Three Months

Let's confirm or cancel that forecast through a technical analysis of
the weekly chart.

To make an OMGUSD price prediction, we will use the [MACD][5] and the
Stochastic [RSI][6].

Both indicators are at the lower limits in the chart above. Stochastic
is in the oversold area and attempts to reverse. The MACD histogram
turned red quite long ago. The moving averages are directed down, but
there's a probability of a bullish signal in 3-4 weekly candles.

This situation indicates that a flat trend at the lower limit will last
for at least several weeks, but consolidation may turn into an upside
price movement within one month.

### Long-Term OMG Analysis for 2021/2022

The interim results of our OMG technical analysis point to an optimistic
market picture where OMG can potentially break through the upper limit
of the range.

Still, the analysis of OMG prices over the past two years shows us that
OMG price movements have been inconsistent. Uptrends were formed through
recurrent bullish impulses and drastic pullbacks. So, OMG's future
prices may develop the same way, and OMG's expected trading range might
be huge.

The chart above presents a Fibonacci grid plotted from the minimum of
March 2020 to the maximum in May 2021. The main extremums coincide with
the key levels of the grid. Those levels have also been considered when
making a realistic forecast for OMG value.

The frequency of momentum may differ from the forecast and will mostly
depend on the incline of a local bullish trend. The less gentle the
angle is, the longer the pattern will last.

The limits of an expected trading range are presented according to the
forecast in the chart above and the table below.

The OMGUSD cryptocurrency will be trading in a range marked with blue
lines for the most of 2021-2022. The upper limit of the range may be
broken shortly before the end of summer 2022 or even earlier. Everything
will depend on buyers' activity and the OMGUSD projected growth.

#### Long-term trading plan for OMG

Let's now make a trading plan for the [OMG cryptocurrency][3]. It should
consist in capitalizing on the next powerful bullish momentum that may
reach 20 US dollars or even more.

However, it might be difficult to identify the beginning of that
momentum. Based on the price [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/), we may have 3 or 4 smaller waves
before the momentum itself, but we can't say for sure how often they
will be forming. So, the wisest strategy would be:

  1. Opening a long trade at 3.60-3.70 USD with Stop Loss below 3 USD.

  2. Temporizing and trailing Stop Loss as the trend unfolds upwards.

  3. Fixing 50% of the position at around 15 USD and let the other half grow to the price target of 20 USD.

## How Did the Price of OMG Change Over Time?

The OMG price has always fluctuated throughout its [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/). The peaks
and troughs of OMG are nothing to be worried about since it’s a normal
occurrence in the crypto market. Besides, the changes are not as drastic
as they were for other cryptocurrencies.

When OMG had an ICO, it was an immediate hit. The project attracted many
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s, raising $25 million in capital in a short amount of time. $25
million was actually the target for the ICO, so the event was an
undeniable success.

Some of the biggest fluctuations happened in 2018 (all-time high of
$28.35 on January 8), and from January 2019 until August 2020, the price
was relatively stable, trading at around $0.5-$2. Below you’ll find the
[historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) exchange rates for OMG/USD:

So, in August 2020, we see a sharp peak in the value, which hasn’t
happened in a long time. The price rose to over $6. However, it didn’t
stay there for long, and the OMG price wasn’t able to go over $4 for the
rest of 2020.

In 2021, there were several significant rate spikes - in February (over
$7.60), April (over $10.40), June (close to $13), and October (over
$16.50). In-between these peaks, there were drastic price drops,
confirming once again that OMG moves in a wide range.

OMG isn’t the strongest or most popular crypto coin. Nevertheless, the
price skyrockets after an announcement of a new partnership or a
significant network improvement. It’s also worth paying attention to
Bitcoin’s movements because it has the trendsetting power that affects
the entire crypto market.

## Conclusion

OmiseGo's initiative to help the world's poorer countries with an
affordable solution is one that is wonderful from a social point of
view. In that respect, we sincerely hope that OmiseGo contributes to a
better and affordable world, especially for the people who need the help
most.

The cryptocurrency market is truly crowded. Over the next few years,
there will be more losers than winners. The coins that succeed will have
the perfect combination of community, technology, and real-world value.

OmiseGo is close to having all three. It’s backed by some very powerful
organizations; it has lots of friends in the crypto community, and its
technology is as strong as any of its competitors. None of this makes
OmiseGo a guaranteed winner, though, so always consider the fact that
the future value is unpredictable.
