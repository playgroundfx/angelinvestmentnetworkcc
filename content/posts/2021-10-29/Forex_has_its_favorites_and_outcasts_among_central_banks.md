Forex has its favorites and outcasts among central banks

## Even central banks won't be spared if they stop obeying the market

Central banks' determination to protect ultra-soft monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) is
regularly under attack at the end of October. Inspired by high
inflation, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s expect an earlier rise in borrowing costs than was
promised by regulators. Once the latter pretended to ignore market
signals, they got a right hook.

The Reserve Bank of Australia had attempted to defend the 3-year bond
target and then gave up the idea. The Aussie consolidated. The ECB had
said whether or not the market was running too fast was none of its
business. European bonds and EURUSD rates soared. So, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s appeared
to take offense at the central banks that were ignoring their signals.

Former ECB chair Wim Duisenberg could afford to say "I hear, but I do
not listen" back in 2001, but such a stance isn't affordable these days.

In March 2020, Christine Lagarde made a mistake saying the ECB wasn't
supposed to regulate spreads in the bond market. As a result, she had to
apologize as bond yields grew. A similar situation occurred in October.
Does she want to be the best at screwing things up? ​

The markets have got a lot of influence and power in the past 20 years,
which shouldn't be ignored. The huge liquidity from the Fed and other
regulators made them feel omnipotent. They now believe they can dictate
central banks what to do. To normalize monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) in response to an
inflation boost or not? To withdraw QE or not? Money is the primary
reason for disputes, in the end. The lack of money is another reason.

However, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s spare those who are affected by the “hall of mirrors”
concept. Though unexpected, the Bank of Canada's decision to give up QE
amid an economic recovery was welcomed by the market. Not only the
loonie but also the NZ dollar and the pound sterling consolidated. What
do those currencies have in common? The fact that their banks aren't
willing to turn a blind eye to the inflation boost. They are skeptical
about the temporary nature of high prices and pessimistic about their
foreign peers’ doing nothing. A pessimist once met an optimist and took
away his last half-full glass of water...

Logically, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s love those to normalize monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) and hate
those who don't. Why shouldn't financial markets get back to normal when
the economy is recovering? I wouldn't be surprised if the BoE's Mark
Carney was just trying to please the market, saying the regulator would
have to step in to tackle inflation. The attempt did no good,
unfortunately: Brexit used to create uncertainty for the pound, and now
it's the Bank of England. Love and hate are just one step apart, right?
Will they eat the BoE for breakfast unless it raises the REPO rate at
the beginning of November? Let's wait and see. Meanwhile, the good old
saying "Don't play against the Fed" is gaining new meanings. Don't play
against the market!
