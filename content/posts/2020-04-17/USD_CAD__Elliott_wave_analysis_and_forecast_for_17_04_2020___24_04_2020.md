USD/CAD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 17/04/2020 –
24/04/2020Alex Geuta

## [USD/CAD][1] remains likely to fall. Estimated pivot point is at a
level of 1.4355.

 **Main scenario:** short positions should be considered from
corrections below the level of 1.4355 with a target of 1.3788 – 1.3598.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
1.4355 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 1.4562 –
1.4800.

 **Analysis:** On the D1 time frame, supposedly, a descending correction
finished developing in the form of second wave of larger degree (2), and
wave (3) started forming. Supposedly, the first counter-trend wave of
smaller degree 1 of (3) formed and a descending correction is developing
in the form of wave 2 of (3) on the H4 time frame. Apparently, wave a of
2 has formed and wave b of 2 is developing on the H1 time frame. If the
presumption is correct, the pair will continue to drop to the levels
1.3788 – 1.3598 once wave b of 2 is completed. The level of 1.4355 is
critical in this scenario as the breakout will enable the pair to
continue rising to the levels of 1.4562 – 1.4800.
