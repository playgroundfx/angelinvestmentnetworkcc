Weekly forecast for oil, gold and EUR/USDAlex Rodiоnov

###  **USCrude – oil**

This week, oil medium-term downtrend has resumed as the price broke out
Target Zone [23.29 – 22.73] and consolidated below. The price has now
stopped close to a strong resistance level 19.00. The price fall stopped
at the same level two weeks ago.

But the downside target is still below, according to the margin zone
methodology. This is Target Zone 2 [17.69 – 17.13]. So, we shall look
for sell entries next week.

To enter sell, the market should approach good sell prices that are both
in the broken-out Target Zone, and in the new correctional one.

If the sell target is reached by the price and there is a reversal
pattern to buy in the 4-hour chart, one might risk and buy oil counter
the ongoing trend.

 **[USCrude][2]Trading tips for the upcoming week: **

  1. Sell according to the pattern in Target Zone [23.29 - 22.73]. TakeProfit: Target Zone 2 [17.69 - 17.13]. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. Sell according to the pattern in Target Zone [26.46 - 25.79]. TakeProfit: Target Zone 2 [17.69 - 17.13]. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

###  **XAUUSD – gold**

This week, there has been a try to reach Target Zone 5 [1757.2 -
1751.2]. The price has shortly failed to reach this zone and is now
being corrected. The trend key support is now in the zone of [1663.9 -
1655.6].

It is clear form the chart that the price is now testing the broken-out
Target Zone 4 [1697.2 – 1691.2] from above. This is also a strong
support level, where one might look for buy entries.

Next week, I recommend looking for long trades with the target at TZ5.
The recommendation will be relevant until the price breaks out the trend
key support downside.

###  **EURUSD – euro/dollar**

The EURUSD price was testing the key resistance of the medium-term
downtrend [1.0957 – 1.0940] and the zone hasn’t been broken out this
week. Besides, there has formed a sell pattern.

The EURUSD is approaching the strong support Target Zone 2 [1.0803 –
1.0786], which was being tested last week. In Target Zone 2, I recommend
exiting short trades entered this week.

After TZ 2 is tested, we shall see if traders will break this support
downside. If they do, the next target in the trend will be TZ 3 [1.0631
— 1.0614].

Do not close sell positions opened in Target Zone [1.0957 - 1.0940].
TakeProfit: Target Zone 2 [1.0803 - 1.0786]. StopLoss: at the breakeven.

> IZ - Intermediary Zone: responsible for the price momentum reversing

breakout.
