USD/JPY: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 17/04/2020 –
24/04/2020Alex Geuta

## [USD/JPY][1] remains likely to fall. Estimated pivot point is at a
level of 111.67.

 **Main scenario:** Consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 111.67 with a target of 101.08 – 94.58.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
111.67 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 114.53 –
118.70.

 **Analysis:** On the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame, supposedly, a big horizontal
correction finished forming as a triangle-shaped wave (В) of B. On the
H4 time frame, wave (С) of B started developing, with the first wave  i
of 1 of (C) formed  and a local correction completed in the form of wave
ii of 1 of (C) inside. Apparently, a local correction is developing as
wave ii of 1 of (C) on the H1 time frame.  If this assumption is
correct, the pair will continue to drop to the levels 101.08 – 98.73
once the correction’s over. The level of 111.67 is critical in this
scenario as the breakout will enable the pair to continue growing to the
levels of 114.53 – 118.70.
