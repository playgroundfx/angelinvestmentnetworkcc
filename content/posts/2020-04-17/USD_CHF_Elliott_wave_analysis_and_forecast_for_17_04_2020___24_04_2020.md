USD/CHF:Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 17/04/2020 –
24/04/2020Alex Geuta

## [USD/CHF][1] remains likely to fall. Estimated pivot point is at a
level of 0.9803.

 **Main scenario:** Consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 0.9803 with a target of 0.9167 – 0.9000.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
0.9803 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 1.0024 –
1.0235.

 **Analysis:** Supposedly, the descending third wave of larger degree
(3) continues developing on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame, with wave 3 of (3)
forming inside. On the H4 time frame, the first wave of smaller degree
i of 3 formed and a correction finished developing in the form of wave
ii of 3. Apparently, the third wave  iii of 3 started developing on the
H1 time frame, with a local correction (ii) of iii completed and wave
(iii) of iii forming inside. If the presumption is correct, the pair
will continue to drop to the levels of 0.9167 – 0.9000. The level of
0.9803 is critical in this scenario. Its breakout will allow the pair to
continue rising to the levels of 1.0024 – 1.0235.
