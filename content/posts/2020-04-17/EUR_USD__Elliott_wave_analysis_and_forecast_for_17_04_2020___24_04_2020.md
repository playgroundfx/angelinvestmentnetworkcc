EUR/USD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 17/04/2020 –
24/04/2020Alex Geuta

## [EUR/USD][1] remains likely to fall. Estimated pivot point is at a
level of 1.0996.

 **Main scenario:** Consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 1.0996 with a target of 1.0630 – 1.0500.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
1.0996 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 1.1170 –
1.1241

 **Analysis:** Supposedly, the descending fifth wave of larger degree
(5) of С continues developing on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame, with the first
wave 1 of (5) formed inside. On the 4-hour time frame, a local
correction finished developing in the form of wave 2 of (5) and wave 3
of (5) started forming. Apparently, an ascending correction finished
developing as wave ii of 3  and wave iii of 3 started forming on the H1
time frame. If the presumption is correct, the pair will continue to
drop to the levels of 1.0630 – 1.0500. The level of 1.0996 is critical
in this scenario. Its breakout will allow the pair to continue rising to
the levels of 1.1170 – 1.1241.
