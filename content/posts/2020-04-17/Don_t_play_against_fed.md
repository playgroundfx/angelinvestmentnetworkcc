Fed stakes its allDmitri Demidenko

##  **The Central bank reversed** **a** **downtrend in the US stock
market**

Still waters run deep. No one expected much of Jerome Powell when he
became the Fed chair 2 years ago. But in fact, the actual Fed turned out
to be the most creative in the whole [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/). It not only revived anti-
recession programs launched in 2008-2009, but it also launched some new
ones. Still, whatever the Fed may do, descendants will always find a
reason for accusations.

Instead of getting into [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) books, one may get into a pretty mess.
Before the coronavirus, Donald Trump would criticize Jerome Powell, but
the pandemic has changed everything. The Fed’s chairman saved financial
markets from hysterics.

True hysterics is when you feel so bad that it’s not funny.

Unprecedented decisions were made at the Fed’s special meetings held in
the form of video conferences: to cut sharply the rate, to buy
treasuries and mortgage-backed securities in unlimited amounts and to
introduce a $2.3 trillion monetary stimulus. Looking at those scales,
one might wonder: what did they drink vodka with there? Well, both
bankers and teachers know that no one can smell vodka on a video call.

Many say it’s Fed that saved the US stock market from collapsing. Still,
its actions became an object of sarcasm which spread over to stock
indexes too. How can a sober person understand why the indexes are
growing amid awful macrostatistics, global recession and record high
death tolls in the USA? Looking at S&P 500’s rally, one may think only
sarcasm can beat the coronavirus.

Powell’s predecessor Janet Yellen called the Fed’s actions quick and
large and Ben Bernanke - important and hard. If the Central bank had
followed standard policies and bought high grade bonds, descendants
could accuse it of excessive love for Wall Street. However, even
acquiring junk bonds from Main Street won’t shut critics up.  Should we
help those who weren’t supposed to survive? Had we better surf on the
waves of indifference than crash against rocks? Finally, people in
trouble are often left to themselves.

I don’t think speaking of natural selection is appropriate during a time
of a pandemic. The Fed did all it could and even more. It reversed the
downtrend for S&P 500 and made fear yield to greed.  The current rally
is just [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s’ desire to catch the last train to the north. Markets
usually recover faster than economy: if they don’t buy stocks now, they
may be late.

Do men really do their own [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/)? Timid boy Powell became the most
creative chairman in a flash. He will enter [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) books as a man who
saved financial markets and made the central bank credible again. S&P
500’s fall in response to the federal funds rate had made us doubt the
“don’t play against the Fed” principle. In April, all fell into place.
Well done, Jey!
