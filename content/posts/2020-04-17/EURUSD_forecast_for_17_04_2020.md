## ECB can double the QE size

In the recession period, the Forex game rules are much simpler.
Investors are watching a single currency, the US dollar that serves as a
kind of safe-haven and is rather responsive to changes in global risk
appetite. The indicator of the risk appetite is traditionally the S&P
500, whose rally is not always natural. Even amid the record number of
deaths from coronavirus in the USA and horrible domestic data, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s
are willing to buy the US stocks, hoping that the recovery of the US
stock indexes uptrend will be followed by the rebound of the US economy.

Investors aren’t discouraged by a 6.8% drop in the Chinese GDP in the
first quarter, by the increase in the US jobless claims by 22 million
over four weeks, or by a sharp rise of the death rate in the USA.
Investors are looking for good [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) and see this as a reason to buy. A
3% rally of the S&P 500 resulted from the announcement of Donald Trump’s
plan to reopen the US economy and a report that a group of coronavirus
patients being treated with the remdesivir drug. If the stock index
doesn’t fall, the US dollar doesn’t rise.

Amid the global recession, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s forgot about the divergence in the
economic growth and monetary policies that were the forex driver in the
past years. Investors ignore the fact that the recession in the euro
area, according to the IMF forecasts, will be deeper than in the US, and
the growth in Italy’s bond yields increases the risks of the expansion
of the euro-area QE. According to Nomura, the ECB has bought bonds for €
85 billion over the past 9 days, and it will have to double its current
pace of the quantitative easing program (about € 130 billion per month)
to counter the further slowdown in GDP and inflation in the euro area.

According to Christine Lagarde, the central bank is ready to increase
the purchase of assets as much as necessary. The ECB board member Isabel
Schnabel says the central banks are willing to adjust monetary tools to
avoid financial fragmentation in the eurozone.

Yes, the Fed is buying far more bonds, and the Federal Reserve has
increased its assets by $1.6 trillion over the past four weeks, but the
expectation of a disaster is scarier than the disaster itself. The
expectation for monetary easing is a stronger forex driver than the
monetary expansion. Under normal conditions. The recession doesn’t allow
calling the current conditions a norm.

The drop in the Chinese GDP by 6.8% in the first quarter is a negative
factor for the euro. The export-led euro-area economy faces a
significant contraction of foreign demand. The same situation, albeit n
a smaller scale, was during the time of the trade wars, when the euro
was falling against the US dollar amid divergence in economic growth.

Now, the game rules have changed. Investors react to good [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) and
ignore the negative, which pushes the S&P 500 up and holds back the
[EUR/USD][2] bears. I don’t think it will last for long. The stock index
is likely to enter a consolidation period soon, which suggests the
eurusd should be trading in the range of 1.065-1.115.
