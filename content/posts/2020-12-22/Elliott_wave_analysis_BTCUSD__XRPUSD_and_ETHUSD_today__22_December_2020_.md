Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 22.12.2020Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I suggest entry signals
to trade each cryptocurrency.

The current XRPUSD structure hints at a horizontal corrective wave
developing, which may take the form of a triangle. Let's consider the
chart in more detail on an H2 time frame.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

 ****

After the completion of corrective wave (4), which took the shape of an
A-B-C zigzag, a new bullish impulse has been developing. At the moment,
sub-waves 1 and 2 have been fully completed, and impulse wave 3 is still
being formed. Most likely, its first four parts are formed, and wave [5]
is just beginning to form. There will possibly be a rise in the price
within wave [5] towards the level of 26000.00.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 23129.00 TP 26000.00

* * *

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

There is the initial part of a horizontal corrective wave [4] forming,
which may take the form of a contracting triangle (a)-(b)-(c)-(d)-(e).
After the end of a bearish wave (a) in the form of a double zigzag
w-x-y, there was a rise in the corrective wave (b). Most likely, wave
(b) will be a simple zigzag, the first two parts of which, waves a and
b, already look completed. In the coming days, the price is expected to
rise above the previous maximum, 0.656, in wave (b).

### Trading plan for **[XRPUSD][2]** today:

Buy 0.518, TP 0.656

* * *

## Elliott wave Ethereum analysis

 ****

As for ETHUSD, the final fifth wave which takes the form of a five-wave
impulse is developing. A bearish correction [4] has been completed
recently, it took the form of a double zigzag (w)-(x)-(y). In the coming
trading week, the cryptocurrency pair could rise above the high of
677.00, formed by the impulse [3], towards the level of 881.01. Consider
opening longs.

### Trading plan for  **[ETHUSD][3] **today:

Buy 613.66, TP 677.00
