Antidepressants harm the Dollar. EURUSD forecast 22.12.2020Dmitri
Demidenko

The return of hopes for a successful Brexit, the fact that the US
Congress passed the COVID-19 aid bill and the soothing rhetoric of the
WHO quickly brought the euro back to life. Will [EURUSD][1] continue to
rally? Let's talk about this and create a trading plan.

## US dollar fundamental forecast for the quarter

More like an antidepressant than a stimulant. First, the House of
Representatives and then the Senate approved an $892 billion fiscal
stimulus package. And even if the deal between Democrats and Republicans
is not a panacea for the US economy (too late to avoid its slowdown in
the first quarter, and, most likely, not enough to eliminate the long-
term damage from recession), but a little something is better than
nothing. The fact that Congress passed the bill, coupled with good [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/)
about Brexit, allowed the [EURUSD][1] bulls to quickly return the pair
back above the base of the 22nd figure.

Thin market and a fair wind, what could be better for the euro fans?
After the quadruple witching day, liquidity in the financial markets
falls, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are preparing for Christmas and postponing strategic
plans to a later period. At the same time, the fiscal stimulus, the
amount of which roughly corresponds to the gap between the current and
potential size of the US economy (if there were no recession), is likely
to support the global risk appetite.

### Dynamics of the US economy

And yet the main good [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) for the [EURUSD][1] bulls came not from the
New, but from the Old World. The positions of Britain and the European
Union on fisheries are becoming closer, which may increase the chances
of successful Brexit before the end of 2020.

As with most divorces, money is the main stumbling block. How much is
the EU willing to pay out of its €650 billion in annual revenues for
European fishermen to access the waters of Great Britain? And for how
long will this access be provided? Initially, London wanted 80% and 3
years, then lowered its demand to 60%. Brussels offered 15-18% and 8
years, a little later it generously offered 25% and 6 years. Finally,
according to an insider from the Financial Times, an option has emerged
on the negotiating table that may suit both sides. 35% and 5 years. The
market smelled a successful Brexit in the air, the pound soared above
$1.34, and the [EURUSD][1] bulls used their chance to buy the euro at a
cheaper price and support the upward trend on the main currency pair.

The WHO has also contributed to supporting the high global risk
appetite, which said the new COVID-19 strain found in Britain is less
transmissible than other diseases such as mumps; mutations of the
coronavirus occur less often than those of the flu, and the vaccines
will be able to cope with all of them. If vaccinations are carried out
on schedule, then by the second quarter of 2021 the economic activity
will return to normal levels, which does not please the fans of safe-
haven assets which include the US dollar.

### Trading plan for [EURUSD][1] for the quarter

As I noted earlier, traders have to see unsuccessful Brexit and problems
with the passing of the fiscal stimulus package through Congress to
count on a [EURUSD][1] correction. Bears now have to dream about bulls
taking profits from longs on the S&P 500, pound sterling and euro made
thanks to the "buy the rumour, sell the [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/)" principle - only then the
bears could hope for a short correction. In general, the trading concept
for 2021 remains the same. The victory over the pandemic, the explosive
growth of the world economy and international trade and the associated
sale of safe-haven assets will let the main currency pair to rise to
1.25.
