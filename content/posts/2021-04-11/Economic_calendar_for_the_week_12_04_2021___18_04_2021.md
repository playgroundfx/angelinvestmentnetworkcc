Economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the week 12.04.2021 – 18.04.2021Jana Kane

##  **Review of the main events of the Forex economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the
next trading week (12.04.2021 – 18.04.2021)**

 **Trading on key Forex [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/): next week we expect the publication of
important macro statistics from the Eurozone, the US, China, Germany,
Australia, as well as the results of the meeting of the Central Bank of
New Zealand.**

Speaking last Thursday at a virtual conference of the International
Monetary Fund, the Fed Chairman Jerome Powell again tried to reassure
market participants that the management of the American central bank
remains committed to pursuing its extra soft [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). Powell also
reiterated concerns about "long-term damage" to the US labor market and
pledged that the central bank will continue to support those who have
lost their jobs due to the coronavirus pandemic and the ensuing
recession. Powell's comments confirm that the economic recovery will be
uneven and incomplete, even regardless of what the data suggests in the
coming months. Other Fed officials also said last week that "monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) will remain unchanged for some time." "The crisis has not yet
been overcome."

Minutes of the Fed's March meeting released last week also indicated an
almost unanimous commitment by the Fed leaders to stick to central bank
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) guidelines and not raise rates until at least the end of 2023.

Taking into account the statements of the Fed leaders and the incoming
macro statistics, the dollar declined last week, while the DXY dollar
index lost 0.8%. At the same time, the yield on 10-year US bonds also
declined last week (to 1.639%), still remaining close to the levels of
15-month highs.

Next week, financial market participants will pay attention to the
publication of important macro statistics from the Eurozone, the US,
China, Germany, Australia, as well as the results of the meeting of the
Central Bank of New Zealand.

 **Traders should pay attention to the publication of the following
macro indicators:**

 ***during the coming week, new events may be added to the [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) and
/ or some scheduled events may be canceled**

 ****GMT time**

###  **Monday, April 12**

###  **09:00** **EUR Retail sales in Eurozone**

Retail sales is a major consumer spending indicator that shows the
change in retail sales. A high result strengthens the euro, and vice
versa, a low result weakens it. Forecast for February: +1.0% and -5.7%
(in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) against -5.9% and -6.4% (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) in January,
+2.0% (+0.6 % in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) in December, -6.1% (-2.9% in annual
[terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) in November, +1.5% (+4.3% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) in October. The data
suggests that retail sales have yet to reach pre-coronavirus levels
after a sharp drop in March-April 2020, when tough quarantine measures
were in place in Europe. Thus, the publication of data with the
indicated values ​​is unlikely to provide significant support to the
euro.

###  **Tuesday, April 13**

###  **12:30 USD Consumer price index (ex food and energy)**

Consumer Price Index (CPI) determines the change in prices of a selected
basket of goods and services for a given period and is a key indicator
for assessing inflation and changes in consumer preferences. Food and
energy have been excluded from this indicator to provide a more accurate
estimate. A high value strengthens the US dollar, while a low value
weakens it. In December 2020, the value of the indicator was +0.1%
(+1.6% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/), and in January 0% and +1.4%, respectively.
Forecast for March: +0.2% and +1.6% (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)), which indicates
some improvement in the situation after the index fell in March and
April 2020 amid the coronavirus pandemic. If the data turn out to be
weaker than forecast, the dollar is likely to respond with a short-term
decline. Data better than forecast will strengthen the dollar.

###  **Wednesday, April 14**

###  **01:00 NZD RBNZ's interest rate decision. Accompanying statement.
Monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) comments**

After the bank's management decided to cut the rate by 0.75% during an
unscheduled meeting in March 2020, the current interest rate of the
Reserve Bank of New Zealand is at 0.25%. The bank's management explained
its decision by the loss of momentum in the New Zealand economy and a
sharp slowdown in the global economy amid the coronavirus pandemic.

“Global economic activity continues to weaken, which wears down demand
for goods and services from New Zealand. Increased uncertainty and
contraction in international trade are contributing to lower economic
growth in trading partner countries,” a recent statement from the RBNZ
said.

The RBNZ believes that wages growth remains weak. At the same time,
inflationary expectations are declining, and low levels of business
confidence indicate a slowdown in hiring and wages growth.

Restrained economic growth (New Zealand's GDP growth has slowed since
the second half of 2018) and a weakening labor market, as well as
escalating international trade wars and a deteriorating global economic
outlook, are forcing the Reserve Bank of New Zealand to keep interest
rates low. An additional and unforeseen risk to the global and New
Zealand economies is the coronavirus epidemic.

It is expected that at this meeting, the RBNZ will not cut or raise the
rate yet, but may speak in favor of lowering it in the coming months if
the economic situation in the country and in the world worsens.

In the accompanying statement and comments, the RBNZ management will
provide an explanation of the decision on the interest rate and comments
on the economic conditions that facilitated the adoption of this
decision.

At this time, the volatility in the quotations of the New Zealand dollar
may rise sharply.

Earlier, the RBNZ stated that against the background of "many factors of
uncertainty" monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) "will remain soft for the foreseeable
future," but "may be adjusted accordingly." According to the bank's
management, for a stable recovery of the New Zealand economy and
inflation growth, "a lower rate of the New Zealand dollar is needed."

Probably, the head of the RBNZ Adrian Orr will reaffirm the bank's
propensity to pursue a soft monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), which will lead to
continued pressure on the New Zealand currency.

###  **Thursday, April 15**

###  **01:30 AUD Employment rate. Unemployment rate**

The employment rate reflects the monthly change in the number of
Australian citizens employed. The growth of the indicator has a positive
impact on consumer spending, which stimulates economic growth. A high
value is positive for the AUD, while a low value is negative. Forecast:
In March, the number of employed Australian citizens increased (after
falling in April by 607,400, in May 2020 by 264,100 and an increase by
29,100 in January 2021).

Also at the same time, the Australian Bureau of Statistics will publish
a report on the unemployment rate - an indicator that estimates the
ratio of the unemployed population to the total number of able-bodied
citizens. The growth of the indicator indicates the weakness of the
labor market, which leads to a weakening of the national economy. The
decline in the indicator is a positive factor for the AUD. Forecast:
unemployment in Australia in March was at the level of 5.7% (against
5.8% in February, 6.4% in January, 6.6% in December). In general, the
indicators cannot be called positive yet. However, in other large
economies, the labor market has deteriorated on an even larger scale due
to the coronavirus.

The leaders of the RBA have repeatedly stated that, in addition to the
situation in international trade, the Australian economy and the central
bank's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) plans are influenced by the indicators of the
level of household debt and expenditures, the growth of workers' wages,
and the state of the country's labor market.

In November 2020, the RB of Australia cut its key interest rate by
another 0.15% to a new record low of 0.1% due to the coronavirus. In the
opinion of the RBA management, an unemployment rate of 4.5% or lower is
required to raise wages and accelerate inflation to the target range.
Unemployment in the country is not declining, and a return of inflation
to the middle of the target range of 2-3% is not even in the distant
horizon.

At the same time, the AUD may react positively to the publication of
data from the country's labor market, since they are better than
previous values. If the values ​​of the indicators turn out to be worse
than the forecast, then the Australian dollar may significantly decline
in the short term.

###  **06:00 EUR Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) in Germany
(final edition)**

This index is published by the EU Statistical Office and is calculated
on the basis of a statistical method agreed between all EU countries. It
is an indicator for assessing inflation and is used by the Governing
Council of the ECB to assess the level of price stability. A positive
result strengthens the EUR, a negative one weakens it.

In January, the HICP index (on an annualized basis) increased by +1.4%
(+1.6% on an annualized basis). The preliminary forecast for March was:
+0.5% and +2.0%, respectively. If the data turn out to be better than
the forecast and the first estimate, then the euro may strengthen in the
short term. The growth of the indicator is a positive factor for the
euro. The data show that inflationary pressures are still low in
Germany. The data worse than the forecast and the previous value will
negatively affect the euro.

###  **12:30 USD Retail sales. Retail control group**

This report (Retail Sales) shows the total sales of retailers of all
sizes and types. Changes in retail sales are the main indicator of
consumer spending. The report is a leading indicator, and in the future
the data may be greatly revised. A high result strengthens the US
dollar, a low one weakens it. A relative decrease in the indicator may
have a short-term negative impact on the dollar, while an increase in
the indicator will have a positive effect on the USD. In the previous
month (February), the indicator decreased by -3.0% (after an increase of
+7.6% in January and a fall of -1.0% in December), which indicates that
the improvement in this sector of the American economy is still unstable
after partial lifting of strict quarantine restrictive measures in a
number of states. Outlook for March: +5.5%, which is likely to have a
positive effect on the USD if the forecast is confirmed.

Retail sales is the leading indicator of consumer spending in the United
States showing changes in retail sales. The Retail Control Group metric
measures volume across the entire retail industry and is used to
calculate price indices for most products. A strong result strengthens
the US dollar, and vice versa, a weak report weakens the dollar. A
slight increase in indicators is unlikely to accelerate the growth of
the dollar. The data worse than the values ​​of the previous period
(-3.5% in February, +8.7% in January, -2.4% in December, -0.9% in
November) may negatively affect the dollar in the short term. Forecast
for March: -0.9%.

###  **Friday, April 16**

The Eurogroup meeting will be held in Europe, attendedn by its
president, finance ministers of the member states of the European Union,
the Monetary Policy Commissioner and the head of the ECB, as well as a
meeting of the Council of Finance Ministers of all member states of the
European Union. They consider issues such as the coordination of
economic measures, budget, government spending, capital flows, the state
of finances and specialized institutions of the European Union.
Unexpected statements or decisions made at these meetings may cause an
increase in volatility in financial markets, and above all in the quotes
of the euro and European stock indices.

###  **02:00 CNY China's GDP for the 1st quarter**

The National Bureau of Statistics of China will present data on GDP
growth in the 1st quarter of 2021.

In the 2nd quarter of 2020, China's GDP grew by +11.5% (+3.2% in annual
[terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)), in the 3rd - by 2.7% (+4.9%, respectively), after a decrease by
-6.8% (-9.8% YoY) in the 1st quarter. China's GDP is expected to grow by
+1.5% (+18.8% on an annualized basis) in the first quarter of 2021.

China is the largest buyer of raw materials and a supplier of a wide
range of finished products to the world commodity market. China's
economy is already the first in the world, according to some reports,
pushing the American economy to second place. Therefore, the publication
of important macroeconomic indicators from China can have a strong
impact on the entire financial market.

The relative decline in GDP may negatively affect the yuan quotes, as
well as the quotes of commodity currencies and currencies of the Asia-
Pacific region, since may indicate a slowdown in the growth rate of the
Chinese economy.

The growth of the indicator will have a positive effect on the Chinese
yuan, as well as on the world, primarily Asian stock indices, as well as
on the quotes of commodity currencies such as the New Zealand and
Australian dollars. China is the largest trade and economic partner of
Australia and New Zealand and a buyer of commodities from these
countries.

Therefore, the positive macro statistics from China may also have a
positive effect on the quotes of these commodity currencies.

###  **02:00 CNY Retail Sales Index**

This index is published monthly by the National Bureau of Statistics of
China and measures total retail sales and cash receipts. The index is
often considered an indicator of consumer confidence and economic well-
being and reflects the health of the retail sector in the near term. A
rise in the index is usually positive for the CNY; a decrease in the
indicator will negatively affect the CNY. The previous value of the
index (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) was +33.8% (after an increase of +8% in the last
months of 2019 and a fall of -20.5% in February 2020). Outlook: In March
2021, retail sales in China increased by +27.2% (YoY), suggesting an
intensifying recovery after a strong fall in February-March 2020. If the
data turns out to be even better, the CNY will strengthen even more.

###  **14:00 USD University of Michigan Consumer Confidence Index
(preliminary release)**

This indicator reflects the confidence of American consumers in the
economic development of the country. A high level indicates economic
growth, while a low level indicates stagnation. Previous indicator
values: 84.9 in March, 76.8 in February, 79.0 in January 2021. An
increase in the indicator will strengthen the USD, while a decrease in
the value will weaken the dollar. This indicator is expected to be
released in April with a value of 88.9. There is a steady trend towards
a gradual recovery in the growth of the indicator, which is positive for
the USD. Poor data may negatively affect the dollar in the short term.
