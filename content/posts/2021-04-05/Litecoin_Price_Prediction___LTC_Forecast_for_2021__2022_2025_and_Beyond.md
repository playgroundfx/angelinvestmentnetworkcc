Litecoin Price Predictions: How It could go in 2021 and BeyondJana Kane

Litecoin cryptocurrency was up by more than 140% in 2020, despite a
recent drawdown that reduced the asset to about $50 per LTC. The
Litecoin price has been through a lot from its launch – going up and
down. Its price started at about $3 per LTC and has gone through a
number of bubble cycles or "alt seasons."

These contributed to a significant rise in the price before a minor
correction occurred. These price corrections do nothing to counter
Litecoin's strong price trajectory. As for the long-term Litecoin
prediction, the outlook suggests that Litecoin's potential is extremely
high. Eventually, Litecoin closed 2020 at $126.23 (on Coinmarketcap).
Will the price of Litecoin go up this year and in the years to come?
Let's find out!

The article covers the following subjects:

## A Bit of Litecoin History

Litecoin ([LTC][1]) is a so-called digital peer-to-peer currency
integrated into open-source software. Technically, the Litecoin project
is very similar to the Bitcoin system. Litecoin production and
transmission are based on an open-source encryption protocol. There is
no central control. With this in mind, all transactions, balances, and
expenses are managed by a peer-to-peer network. Litecoin is created on
the basis of a cryptological hash function, which in turn generates
blocks. Litecoin can be exchanged for Bitcoin and fiat money. The
processing in question usually takes place via online exchanges
([cryptocurrency exchange](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/best-cryptocurrency-exchange/)s).

Litecoin was created by a former Google employee, Charlie Lee, in 2011.
The cryptocurrency was created based on the Bitcoin protocol but differs
in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of the hash algorithm used. Furthermore, it also differs in
hard caps, block transaction times, and some other factors. Litecoin was
released via an open-source client on GitHub on October 7, 2011. On
October 13, 2011, 5 days later, the Litecoin network went live.

Lee's goal was to create a light version of Bitcoin with Litecoin.
Developers have always stated that you can consider Litecoin to be the
silver version of Bitcoin. Litecoin differs from Bitcoin in the
prioritization of the transaction confirmation rate, which is
approximately 2.5 minutes per block. However, the reality is that
Litecoin users will have to wait up to about 30 minutes for their
transaction to be processed due to network congestion.

## Why Is Litecoin an Attractive Investment Asset?

Litecoin is especially faster at handling payments than Bitcoin and is
an excellent, proven complementary alternative. It's a very cheap,
super-safe highway for making payments - especially when it comes to
micro-transactions, like, for example, when paying for a cup of coffee.
In addition, the Litecoin community is working on the implementation of
all kinds of new fintech gadgets that are actually intended for Bitcoin.
Litecoin is now working on the implementation of the lightning network
protocol and applications for [smart contract](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/smart-contract-on-blockchain/)s and privacy (including
confidential transactions & MimbleWimble). Litecoin is certainly light
and cheap, but above all in good hands with fantastic ambitions.
Litecoin has a bright future as a classic and reliable altcoin.

Most [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s see Bitcoin as gold and Litecoin as silver. Litecoin was
developed as an alternative to Bitcoin and developed as a lightweight
that solved some shortcomings of Bitcoin. It is a classic altcoin with
more than 6 years of experience and development behind it. Software
updates and new tech can be easily added to Litecoin.

As with Bitcoin, there is also a built-in scarcity. In total, only 84
million Litecoin can be mined. Litecoin can be considered a much cheaper
and faster alternative. In fact, Litecoin is underestimated relative to
other cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is slower and more expensive to use
compared to Litecoin.

The fact that Litecoin is fast and cheap has advantages, especially
since people in third world countries without bank accounts can still
get Litecoin cheaply and quickly.

### Why is Litecoin going up?

Litecoin is a superior alternative to fiat money when compared to
Ethereum. Ethereum was not developed as money, but it can certainly be
used as such. You could rather consider Ethereum to be crypto gas.

In addition, Ethereum is a much more difficult concept to grasp than
Litecoin. Litecoin is just digital p2p money with a built-in scarcity
that actually works faster as a transaction medium. This makes adoption
much easier and does not require much knowledge. Simply install the
wallet app on your smartphone, and you will have your own Swiss Litecoin
bank account with which you can actually conduct transactions almost
immediately. As the popularity and price of Bitcoin increase and,
therefore, the transaction costs rise, cheaper and faster alternatives
will be sought. This is Litecoin, baby.

## Other Interesting Facts

Litecoin has made a lot of progress and has even been included as a
means of payment in Venezuela's mainstream international payments
system. Via the Remesas remittance platform, foreigners can send
Litecoin to family members and friends in Venezuela who receive Bolivars
in their local bank account through Remesas. A commission of 15% is
charged, which means that the government in Venezuela secretly collects
Litecoin.

Another interesting fact is that the Litecoin Foundation has a 9.9%
share in the German WEG bank. The Litecoin Foundation has received this
as a donation from the Swiss [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) company TokenPay. Together they
have almost a 20% share in this conservative German bank, mainly for
real estate [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s. Litecoin can thus be recognized in the long-term
as a possible cryptocurrency for buying real estate in Germany? But we
digress, so let's not dive too deep into the matter, look at the price
[history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/), and see how the coin develops.

## Litecoin Price Analysis

Despite it not being a bullish period for cryptocurrencies until around
October 2020, Litecoin has performed reasonably well compared to its
competitors. Charlie Lee is clearly doing really well; he finally
introduced confidential transactions (CT). Like the privacy coins ZCash
and Monero, LTC’s confidential transactions will prevent replaceability,
scalability, and privacy issues.

The acceptance rate is also quite high. Very recently, the Litecoin logo
was even advertised on the UFC mat during a famous fight. It was a real
eye-catcher. Furthermore, a new shopping center in Singapore with an ATM
that accepts both Bitcoin and Litecoin has been installed. LTC price
prediction is very optimistic in the opinion of experts.

Experts expect the Litecoin future to be bright in 2021 due to all
integrations and partnerships. In addition, the Litecoin community is
very active, with all the upcoming developments. They will, of course,
keep the enthusiasts informed. There is a clear potential that Litecoin
will rise further and is certainly a tough competitor for the other
cryptos.

If Litecoin can break above its current price and hold on in the long-
run, the Litecoin forecast says it will finally retest its all-time
high. The maximum height for the Litecoin /US dollar rate is likely to
remain below $300 for much of the next year. What will Litecoin do in
the next 5 years?



## Litecoin Price Predictions by Crypto Experts

The cryptocurrency market is very volatile, which means that predicting
reliable prices of cryptocurrencies is indeed one of the most difficult
things to do. Let’s have a look at some recent expert publications
regarding their statement and LTC prediction and its market price. They
may give us food for thought about Litecoin coin review:

### Trading Beasts

A technical analysis performed by Trading Beasts predicted that by the
end of 2020, LTC might reach around $47 and that it is good for
investment in the long run. We now know that LTC closed December 31st,
2020, at $126.23 (on Coinmarketcap). That’s quite higher than predicted!

### Wallet Investor

Wallet Investor always has been frank and conservative in predicting all
cryptocurrencies. They have again come out with conservative Litecoin
price predictions, where they stated that LTC might reach $22.95 by the
end of last year. We guess no one expected the BTC boom! Shh. We didn’t
either.

### Long Forecast

According to a published Long Forecast research, the price of Litecoin
should have reached $55 by the end of 2020. Their Litecoin projection
growth forecast was a bit more optimistic than the previous two, but
still, they underestimated how much power Litecoin has.

### CoinPrice

Finally, someone who believed in LTC! CoinPrice predicted that the
Litecoin growth might reach as high as $124 by 2020. As we have seen
from the previous expert outlets, this was quite an optimistic
prediction, but they stood by it and were the most accurate of them all!
Nice work on that projected analysis, CoinPrice!

## Litecoin Technical Analysis

To provide a realistic Litecoin future price forecast, I will start the
LTC technical analysis with the study of the [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) data of the[
LTC/USD][2] rate movements in the long term. Let us analyze the monthly
timeframe.

 ****

Let us define the global trend first. Litecoin, like the rest of the
cryptocurrency market, has been developing the bullish trend since March
2020. ****

There is the monthly chart of the Litecoin to US dollar price. Blue dots
mark the most significant trade volume in 2019–2020.

The earliest surge in the trader activity, which occurred in May 2019,
corresponds to the extended green candlestick. Its high forms a strong
resistance level at $146, marked with the green line. In December 2020,
the market price didn’t break it out.

In January, the Litecoin price was testing the level and broke it out
upside. In February, the LTC coin consolidated above. According to the
LTC/USD analysis, level 146 USD is a strong support zone currently.

### LTC price prediction for next three months

 ****

I should also take into account [Bollinger Bands](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/bollinger-bands.html) to perform a profound
LTC/USD analysis.

The local high in January 2021 is much higher than the upper band; next,
the price bounced off. A similar situation occurred in 2019, during the
previous growth wave. This is a typical signal that the coin is
overbought. Over the three weeks, the signal has appeared once again,
and Litecoin has already started a corrective price movement, which
could continue in the short-term outlook.

To present an LTC prediction for the next three months, let us analyze
the LTCUSD price fractals in the Litecoin trend [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/). The above chart
displays similar bullish fractals with three peaks. After the upward
price movement finished, a deep correction started, according to the
price [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/).

I have conventionally divided this market movement into three stages:

  * Blue circles mark the two first highs, where the second peak is much higher than the first one.

  * Green circles mark the final wave of the uptrend.

  * Red circles mark a smooth correction composed of seven waves.

 ****

The final wave of the green circle seems to have completed. It is clear
from the Fibonacci grid applied to the third wave.

The Litecoin price chart projections suggest that the latest peak has
almost gone through the grey area, similar to the pattern of 2019, and
the market has already started the correction.

Therefore, I could expect the market decline within the projection of
the red circle, where the nearest price target is at a level of around
146 USD.

### Monthly Litecoin price forecast for 2021

 ****

Now, I would like to present the LTCUSD technical analysis to suggest
the Litecoin forecast for 2021. I will use the study of the price
fractals in 2018 and 2019, trendline analysis, and [Bollinger Bands](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/bollinger-bands.html).

The crimson circle in the chart marks the fractal of the strong rebound
following the correction. Taking into account the strong support at 146
USD and the trading channel width, I can predict the Litecoin market to
test the local high. After that, the correction is likely to continue.

The next strong support zone, [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/)ly confirmed in 2017, 2018 and
2020, is between 80 and 100 dollars. The market is likely to retest
these levels in 2021.

Based on the [Bollinger Bands](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/bollinger-bands.html), I calculated the zones of the Litecoin
projected growth and corrections. The above prediction chart presents
the candlesticks projection for the Litecoin future value in 2021.

LTC/USD][2] market moves in 2021, the averaged prediction data.

signals based on the Elliott wave analysis. ****

## Weekly Elliott wave Litecoin analysis as of 05.04.2021

The LTCUSD market is forming a large zigzag-shaped pattern A-B-C. After
a large upward wave A completed, the market has formed a long corrective
wave B as a triple bearish zigzag. There is now developing the impulse
wave [1]-[2]-[3]-[4]-[5], which is constructing the final leg of the
zigzag, wave C. Let us explore the most recent chart section in more
detail in the eight-hour timeframe.

The eight-hour timeframe of the LTCUSD price chart displays the upward
impulse wave [3], with the first three legs completed inside – the sub-
waves (1)-(2)-(3). There is unfolding a horizontal corrective wave (4)
as a contracting triangle A-B-C-D-E. Shortly, the market will be moving
in the final wave E of the triangle to a level of 180.00. At this level,
wave E will be 76.4% of wave D. This ratio is highly likely to be
reached.

## Litecoin Price Prediction: 2022 - 2023

The LTC price prediction is performed based on the fact that it is the
5th most appreciated cryptocurrency in the world. With its low
transaction costs and fast confirmations, LTC is really becoming the new
global payment standard for consumers and businesses worldwide. Litecoin
also reassures traders that costs are likely lower than they thought.
The processing fees are far less than those incurred by credit cards and
other forms of payments. Even the integration is free!

As Litecoin is steadily gaining more popularity, the acceptance ratio
might also increase. It is already high compared to the other newcomers.
We predict that the price is going to climb pretty high in the years
2022 and 2023, when it may have the power to reach the 900 dollar mark.

## Long Term Litecoin Price Prediction: 2025-2030

The third halving for Litecoin is set to take place in 2023. In doing
so, block rewards would be halved to 6.25 LTC. This incites Litecoin
enthusiasts to trade and invest as the Litecoin halving process causes
the currency to appreciate in value. Litecoin could even excel above its
competitors to become one of the most traded cryptocurrencies. As of
now, the rewards per block are [12.5 coins][6] and will decrease to 6.25
coins per block post halving.

As such, the prediction for Litecoin by 2025-2030 is that its projected
value could reach $1200. Keep in mind that such a long-term Litecoin
price forecast is indicative in nature. Forecasts for such a long time
are very approximate and are often no more than speculation.

## How Has the Price of Litecoin Changed Over Time?

The LTC price today is $217.84. This value is interactive, so you will
be able to see the price tomorrow right here in this article. On the
current CoinMarketCap [ranking](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/crypto-exchange-ranking/)s, Litecoin ranks #5, with a market cap of
$9,957,064,586 (January 3rd, 2021). The circulating Litecoin supply is
66,230,155 LTC, while the maximum stock is 84,000,000 LTC coins. The
Litecoin price hit its all-time high of $375.29 on December 19, 2017.
But in order to make the most reliable cryptocurrency predictions, it's
important not just to look ahead but also to look back at the [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/)
price performance of Litecoin. The current Litecoin price is quite
promising. Below you'll see how Litecoin performed over the years of its
existence:



## Is Litecoin a Good Investment?

Litecoin, buy or sell? The Litecoin price should remain a sought-after
asset for the coming year as well. In the past three months alone, the
currency is up 120 percent. Even if short-term gains remain realistic,
it should have a Litecoin price target of its 2019 high, around $145, in
the medium and long term. Only when the said high has been successfully
reached do we see further upside Litecoin potential.

The coronavirus pandemic is likely to remain at the heart of the markets
in 2021. In response to the massive support of central bankers from the
world's major central banks, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are increasingly looking for a
hedge to counter value risk. Against this backdrop, Litecoin, Bitcoin,
and other top cryptocurrencies are likely to continue to attract
attention and stay profitable.

If Litecoin can break above its current price and hold on in the long-
run, the Litecoin forecast says it will finally retest its all-time
high. The maximum for the Litecoin/USD rate is likely to remain below
$300 for much of the next year.

Below is a prediction chart for 2021. One feasible LTC chart, based on
the opinions of experts, and Litecoin [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/), could be as follows:
