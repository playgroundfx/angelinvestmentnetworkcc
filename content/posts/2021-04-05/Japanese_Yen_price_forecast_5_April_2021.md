Yen depends on the stock market. Forecast as of 05.04.2021Dmitri
Demidenko

Neither the epidemiological situation nor the state of the Japanese
economy is of particular concern to [USDJPY][1] traders. The fate of the
pair lies in the hands of US Treasuries and the Japanese stock market.
Let us discuss the Forex outlook and make up a trading plan

## Monthly Japanese yen fundamental forecast

While the dollar does not know [how to](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-trading-how-to/) behave in response to positive US
economic data release, the yen reacts quite predictably. The release of
strong data on US PMI and employment could have two consequences. The
first one is a growth of stock indices, which is harmful to the
greenback as a safe-haven currency. The second one is a rally in
Treasury yields, which is perceived as good [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) for the USD index.
[USDJPY][1] price grows in both cases.

The Japanese buy American securities, and the Americans buy Japanese
while the yen continues to weaken. According to the Ministry of Finance
of Japan, from the beginning of February to March 20, Japanese
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s' net income amounted to ¥2.815 trillion from foreign bonds.
Morgan Stanley research shows that Treasuries were most actively sold at
the Asian Forex session at the turn of winter and spring, while in March
sellers were active at both at both Asian and European sessions. Thus,
Japanese [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s were at the origins of the rapid rally in US bond
yields, which undermined [USDJPY][1] bears' position.

At the same time, foreign [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s' interest in Japanese stocks is
growing. This interest was initiated by the well-known [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) Warren
Buffett, who acquired the shares of Itochu, Marubeni, Mitsubishi,
Mitsui, and Sumitomo. His company Berkshire Hathaway issues yen-
denominated debt to attract cheap resources. According to Morningstar,
net capital inflows into [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/)s targeting the Japanese stock market
totaled $3.1 billion from August to January, compared with an outflow of
$22.8 billion for the period from August 2015 to July 2020.

The situation at [Nikkei 225][2] does look pretty good. In November, the
index finally updated its all-time high of 26489 recorded in 1991 and
continued the rally. The [S&P 500][3] in the same period rose from 390
to more than 4000. The Japanese stock market grew by 27% from October 1
to April 1, the US one - only by 19%. It is becoming very profitable for
foreigners to invest in Japanese issuers' securities, while hedging
against currency risks raises the [USDJP][1] prices to the maximum since
March 2020.

The fact that the Bank of Japan is not going to abandon the ultra-easy
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) and that the Japanese government is considering
introducing another additional budget to combat the pandemic will
positively impact Japanese stock indexes and the [USDJPY][1] bulls.

### Monthly [USDJPY][1] trading plan

In my opinion, the pair's correction will be possible only if Joe Biden
has problems with passing the legislation concerning ​​raising corporate
tax from 21% to 28% through Congress. The tax project begins to meet
resistance among big businesses. The chances of its approval by
legislators are decreasing because there is a lot of money behind every
significant politician. This is modern reality. The controversy could
stall a rally in US Treasury yields. However, in my opinion, any
[USDJPY][1] obstacles on the way to 112 and 114 will be temporary. I
recommend buying the pair.
