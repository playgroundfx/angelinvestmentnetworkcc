Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 05.04.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

Gold has been trading in a short-term uptrend since last week. On
Thursday, April 1, the Target Zone 1732 - 1727 was reached.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

Last week, traders tested the short-term uptrend key support 59.68 -
59.42. The price didn't break out the zone, which caused traders'
reaction.

Price growth on Thursday, April 1, was stopped in the resistance zone
​​61.67 - 61.42. The breakout of this zone is required to open new
purchases. In this case, the breakthrough of last week's high and a test
of level 62.84 will occur.

Today since the opening of trading, a decline in prices has been
observed. The level of 60.52 was tested at the Asian session. If this
level is broken out, then the bears will again try to break out the
short-term uptrend's border.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

  1. Open buy positions above level 61.67. TakeProfit: 62.84. StopLoss: 61.28.

  2. Open sell positions below level 60.52. TakeProfit: 59.15. StopLoss: 61.12.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

Gold has been trading in a short-term uptrend since last week. On
Thursday, April 1, the Target Zone 1732 - 1727 was reached. For further
growth, price consolidation above this level is required. The target for
purchases will be the Gold Zone 1755 - 1752.

As long as the resistance is being held, a correction to strong
supports, Additional Zone 1718 - 1716 and Intermediary Zone 1705 - 1703,
can become a general focus of attention. Correction to these levels will
allow considering new long trades at favorable prices with a target at
level 1732.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

  1. Buy according to the pattern in Additional Zone 1718 - 1716. TakeProfit: 1732. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. Buy according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 1705 - 1703. TakeProfit: 1732. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

short-term downtrend. On Friday last week, traders tested the trend
border 1.1792 - 1.1784. The price didn’t break out the zone, and now a
subsequent decline can be observed.

The test of intraday support 1.1746 - 1.1742 has just taken place. The
technical level of 1.1750 is located near this zone. If the price does
not break out abovementioned levels, then consider buying the euro with
a target at 1.1792.

consider selling the euro with a target at 1.1706.
