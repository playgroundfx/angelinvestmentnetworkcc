Economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the week 30.08.2021 – 05.09.2021Jana Kane

##  **Review of the main events of the Forex economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the
next trading week (30.08.2021 – 05.09.2021)**

The dollar fell, while the major US stock indexes rose last week. Gold
quotes also rose, reaching a 3-week high above $1818.00 per ounce.

Speaking Friday at the annual economic forum in Jackson Hole, the Fed
Chairman Jerome Powell reiterated the central bank's plans to phase out
stimulus [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). He also said that at the July Fed meeting, "like most
of its participants, he supported the view that if the economy as a
whole recovers in line with expectations, it may be appropriate to start
slowing down" the purchases of assets on which the Fed has spent 120
billion dollars already this year. "While the delta strain poses short-
term risk, the prospect of continuing to move towards maximum employment
looks good," Powell said.

However, Powell's speech did not provide a clear signal on the timing of
the start of such a curtailment. This suggests that it is unlikely to be
expected before the November Fed meeting.

That being said, Powell remains confident that the jump in inflation
this year is temporary. In his opinion, the current [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the Fed is
"well tuned." “As always, we are ready to adjust it as appropriate to
achieve our goals,” he added.

Market participants considered Powell's speech positive enough not to
start taking profits in long positions in the stock market. The dollar
fell. Nevertheless, economists believe that its easing is unlikely to be
sustained, given the pressure on the Fed from rising inflation.

The next week will be transitional between the coming end of August and
the beginning of September and autumn. It will be marked by the
publication of important macro statistics from China, Germany, Eurozone,
the US, Australia, Canada, and Switzerland. But the focus of [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s
will be on the publication on Friday of monthly data from the US labor
market, which, along with inflation and GDP data, are key for the Fed in
determining the prospects for its monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).

 ***during the coming week, new events may be added to the [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) and
/ or some scheduled events may be canceled**

 ****GMT time**

###  **Monday, August 30**

It's Summer bank holiday in the UK and Commonwealth countries. Banks are
closed on this day, and most of the population is dismissed from work.
In this regard, trading volumes during the European trading session will
be reduced.

###  **12:00 EUR Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) in Germany
(preliminary release)**

This index is published by the EU Statistical Office and is calculated
on the basis of a statistical method agreed between all EU countries. It
is an indicator for assessing inflation and is used by the Governing
Council of the ECB to assess the level of price stability. A positive
result strengthens the EUR, a negative one weakens it.

Preliminary forecast for August: +3.4% (against +3.1% in July, +2.1% in
June, +2.4% in May, +2.1% in April, +2.0% in March, +1.6% in January and
February, -0.7% in December and negative values ​​in the second half of
2020) in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/). If the data turn out to be better than the
forecast, the euro may strengthen in the short term. The growth of the
indicator is a positive factor for the euro. The data suggests
increasing inflationary pressures in Germany. The data worse than the
forecast and the previous value will negatively affect the euro.

###  **Tuesday, August 31**

###  **01:00 CNY China Services and Manufacturing PMIs from China
Federation of Logistics and Purchasing (CFLP)**

These indicators assess the state of the services sector and the
manufacturing sector in the Chinese economy. A result above 50 is
considered positive and strengthens the yuan. Previous PMI values ​​for
the services sector: 53.3 in July, 55.2 in May, 56.3 in March, 51.4 in
February, 52.4 in January. The indicator is above 50, which is likely to
have a positive effect on the yuan quotes, even with a slight relative
decline. If the indicator is below 50, the yuan will be under pressure
and likely to decline. Forecast for August: 52.8.

Previous PMI values ​​for the manufacturing sector: 50.4 in July, 51.0
in May, 51.9 in March, 50.6 in February, 51.3 in January.

The relative growth of the index and the indicator above the value of 50
should have a positive effect on the CNY. The data above the value of 50
indicates an increase in activity, which has a positive effect on the
quotes of the national currency. In the opposite case, and if the
indicator is below 50, the yuan will be under pressure and probably will
decrease. Forecast for August: 50.2.

###  **09:00 EUR** Consumer Price Index. Core CPI (preliminary release)

Consumer Price Index (CPI) is published by Eurostat and measures the
price change of a selected basket of goods and services over a given
period. The index is a key indicator for assessing inflation and changes
in purchasing habits. A positive result strengthens the EUR, a negative
one weakens it. At the end of 2020, the CPI index fell by -0.3%, which
indicated low inflationary pressures and even a slowdown in inflation.
However, in 2021, inflation in the Eurozone began to accelerate,
periodically exceeding the target level of the ECB.

Forecast for August 2021: +2.8% (YoY) against +2.2% in July, +1.9% in
June, +2.0% in May, +1.3% in March, +0.9% in January and February. If
the data turns out to be worse than the forecast, the euro may drop
sharply in the short term. Data better than the forecast and / or the
previous value may strengthen the euro in the short term. We also remind
that the target level of consumer inflation by the ECB is slightly below
2.0%.

Core Consumer Price Index (Core CPI) determines the change in prices of
a selected basket of goods and services for a given period and is a key
indicator for assessing inflation and changes in consumer preferences.
Food and energy have been excluded from this indicator to provide a more
accurate estimate. A high result strengthens the EUR, while a low result
weakens it. In July 2021, Core CPI grew by +0.7%, +0.9% in June, +1.0%
in May, +0.7% in April (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) after more modest values ​​of
+0. 2% between September and December 2020. If the data for August turn
out to be worse than the previous value or forecast, this may negatively
affect the euro. If the data turn out to be better than the forecast or
the previous value, the euro is likely to react with an increase in
quotations, but only in the short term. Core inflation in the Eurozone
remains low, which is a negative factor for the euro. Forecast for
August: +1.5%.

###  **12:30 CAD Canada GDP. Annual data on Canada GDP**

Canada's GDP report is published by Statistics Canada. Strong report
will strengthen the CAD. Weak GDP report will negatively affect the CAD.
The previous report indicated a decline in Canada GDP (in May) by -0.3%.

Canada's Quarterly GDP report reflects the total volume of all goods and
services produced by Canada for the quarter (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) and is
considered an indicator of the general health of the Canadian economy.
In the previous 1st quarter of 2021, GDP grew by +5.6% (after growing by
+9.3% in the 4th quarter and falling by -38.1% in the 2nd quarter of
2020). If the data for the 2nd quarter of 2021 turns out to be stronger
than the previous value, the CAD will strengthen. Forecast: -0.2% in
June and +6.7% in the second quarter. This is a positive data for the
CAD, despite its relative decline (in monthly [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)).

###  **Wednesday, September 1**

###  **01:30 AUD Australia GDP (Q2)**

Australian Bureau of Statistics will report on the country's GDP, which
is the main indicator of the state of the Australian economy, for the
2nd quarter. Strong report will strengthen AUD. Weak GDP report will
negatively affect the AUD. Forecast: +0.5% (against +1.8% in Q1, +3.2%
in Q4, +3.4% in Q3, -7.0% in Q2, -0.3% in Q1 of 2020). The growth of the
indicator is a positive factor for the AUD, the decrease is negative. If
the data turns out to be worse than the forecast, the AUD may decline
sharply.

###  **06:00 EUR Retail sales in Germany**

Retail sales index is the main indicator of consumer spending in Germany
showing changes in retail sales. A high result strengthens the euro, and
vice versa, a low result weakens it. Forecast: -0.9% (+3.2% yoy) in July
against +4.2% (+6.2% yoy) in June, +4.2% (-2.4% yoy) annualized) in May,
-2.0% (+4.4% yoy) in April, +7.7% (+11% yoy) in March, +1.2% (-9.0 % in
annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) in February, -4.5% (-8.7% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) in January.

The data indicate the instability of the recovery of this sector of the
German economy, including due to lockdowns due to the coronavirus.
Better-than-expected data is likely to have a positive effect on the
euro, but in the short term.

###  **12:15 USD ADP National Employment Report**

Typically, the ADP's private sector employment report has a strong
impact on the market and dollar quotes. An increase in the value of this
indicator has a positive effect on the dollar. The US private sector
workforce growth is expected to be +500,000 in August (against an
increase of 330,000 in July, 692,000 in June, 978,000 in May, 742,000 in
April, 517,000 in March, 117,000 in February, 174,000 in January, down
-123,000 in December). The relative growth of the indicator may have a
positive effect on the dollar quotes, while the relative decline in the
indicator may have a negative effect. Therefore, the market reaction may
be negative, and the dollar may decline if the data turns out to be
worse than forecast.

Millions of Americans have previously been laid off due to the
coronavirus pandemic and related quarantine measures. The bulk of
layoffs were concentrated in tourism and retail. Other important sectors
of the economy were also affected. ADP previously reported that the most
significant drop in employment was recently noted in the construction
and financial services sectors.

Although the ADP report does not directly correlate with the official US
Labor Department data, which will be released on Friday, the ADP report
is often a harbinger of it, having a noticeable impact on the market.

###  **14:00 USD US Manufacturing PMI from ISM**

Published by the Institute for Supply Management (ISM), the US
Manufacturing PMI is an important indicator of the health of the US
economy as a whole. A result above 50 is seen as positive and
strengthens the USD, one below 50 as negative for the US dollar.
Forecast: 58.6 in August (against 59.5 in July, 60.6 in June, 61.2 in
May, 60.7 in April, 64.7 in March, 60.8 in February 58.7 in January, 60,
7 in December). The index is above the 50 level and has a relatively
high value, which is likely to support the dollar, despite the relative
slight decline in the indicator. The data above the value of 50
indicates an acceleration of activity, which has a positive effect on
the quotes of the national currency. If the indicator falls below the
forecast and, especially, below the value of 50, the dollar may sharply
weaken in the short term.

###  **Thursday, September 2**

###  **01:30 AUD Balance of Trade**

The indicator (balance of trade) assesses the ratio between Australia's
exports and imports. Growth in exports from Australia leads to an
increase in the trade surplus, which has a positive impact on the AUD.
Previous value A$ 10.496 billion (June), A$ 9.681 billion (May), A$
8.028 billion (April), A$ 5.574 billion (March), A$ 7.529 billion
(February). A decrease in the trade surplus may negatively affect the
Australian dollar. Conversely, the growing trade surplus is a positive
factor for the AUD. Forecast for July: A$ 9.542 billion.

###  **07:00 CHF Switzerland GDP for Q2**

GDP is considered an indicator of the general state of a country's
economy and estimates the rate of its growth or decline. The Gross
Domestic Product report expresses in monetary [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) the aggregate value
of all final goods and services produced by Switzerland over a given
period of time. An upward trend in the GDP indicator is considered a
positive factor for the national currency (franc), while a low result is
considered negative (or bearish).

In the previous 1st quarter of 2021, GDP contracted by -0.5% (-0.5%
YoY), after an increase of +7.6% in the 3rd quarter, a decrease of -7.0%
in 2 quarter and a decrease of -1.7% in the first quarter of 2020. It
seems that the situation with the GDP and the economy of Switzerland is
improving after their fall in the first half of 2020, although this
decline can not be compared with the fall in GDP in Germany, the
Eurozone and the United States, however, at a very uneven pace.
Switzerland's GDP is projected to contract by 2.6% (YoY) in the 2nd
quarter of 2021. The data indicate a slowdown in the recovery of the
Swiss economy, which is a negative factor for the franc.

If the data turns out to be weaker than the forecast, the franc may
decline in the short term. However, one should not expect a strong fall
in the franc, as it is in active demand as a defensive asset. Better-
than-expected data may strengthen the franc in the short term.

###  **Friday, September 3**

###  **09:00 EUR Retail sales in the Eurozone**

Retail sales is a major consumer spending indicator that shows the
change in retail sales. A high result strengthens the euro, and vice
versa, a low result weakens it. Forecast for July: +1.2% (+5.2% in
annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) against +1.5% (+5.0% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) in June, +4.6%
(+9.0% in annualized) in May, -3.1% and +23.9% (annualized) in March,
+3.0% and -2.9% (annualized) in February, -5.9% and -6.4% (annualized)
in January. The data suggests that, despite the rise in indices, retail
sales have not yet reached pre-coronavirus levels after a sharp drop in
March-April 2020, when strict quarantine measures were in force in
Europe. Nevertheless, better-than-expected data is likely to have a
positive effect on the euro.

###  **12:30 USD Average hourly wages. Non-farm payrolls. Unemployment
rate**

The most important indicators of the state of the labor market in the
United States in August. Forecast: +0.4% (against +0.4% in July, +0.3%
in June, +0.5% in May, +0.7% in April, -0.1% in March, +0.2% in January
and February, +0.8% in December, +0.3% in November) / +0.665 million
(against +0.943 million in July, +0.850 million in June, +0.559 million
in May, +0.266 million in April, +0.916 million in March, +0.379 in
February, +0.049 million in January, -0.140 million in December, +0.245
million in November, +0.638 million in October, +1.763 million in July
and -20.687 million in April 2020) / 5.2% (against 5.4% in July, 5.9% in
June, 5.8% in May, 6.1% in April, 6.0% in March, 6.2% in February, 6.3%
in January, 6.7% in December and November, 6.9% in October, 13.3% in May
and 14.7% in April 2020), respectively.

In general, the indicators can be described as encouraging. The data
speaks of continued improvement in the US labor market after plummeting
in the first half of 2020. Prior to the coronavirus, the US labor market
remained strong, signaling the stability of the American economy and
supporting dollar quotes.

It is often difficult to predict the market reaction to the publication
of indicators. Many indicators for previous periods are subject to
revision. Now it will be even more difficult to do this, because the
economic situation in the United States and many other large economies
remains controversial due to the coronavirus. In any case, when data
from the US labor market is published, a surge in volatility is expected
in trading not only in USD, but throughout the entire financial market.
Probably the most cautious [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s will choose to stay out of the
market during this time frame.

###  **14:00 USD US Services PMI (from ISM)**

This indicator assesses the state of the services sector in the US
economy. These services sectors (as opposed to the manufacturing sector)
have practically no impact on the country's GDP.

In July, this indicator came out with a value of 64.1. A result above 50
is seen as positive for the USD. Outlook for August: 61.3, which is
likely to have a positive overall effect on the USD. However, a deeper
relative decline in the index could negatively affect the dollar in the
short term.
