Ethereum v2.0: to buy or not to buyMikhail Hypov

##  **ETHUSD: Fundamental and technical analysis, roadmap and Vitalik
Buterin, trend analysis, volume analysis and harmonious patterns.**

Amid the unfolding coronavirus chaos and global economic crisis, we
almost missed an important event in the cryptocurrency world. On 19th
March, creator of Ethereum Vitalik Buterin published a roadmap where he
described in details his vision of Ethereum’s development. All would
have been OK, but the community was angered that the realization of the
project had been delayed by 5-10 years.  Works on a transition to POS-
mining and sharding started in 2018. However, because of the delay we
might not see the final version of Ethereum v 2.0 before 2030.

You can check Buterin’s original tweet [here][3].

I can understand the disappointment of Ethereum fans: transition to POS
has been delayed many times and while waiting for it, people have
stocked up on Ethereum for investment purposes. The current economic
situation in the world is complicated, and Ethereum holders might be
wondering if holding Ethereum is wise. Or it should be sold and rebought
in better circumstances later, while safer assets will help wait till
the crisis is over.

I’m going to answer these questions in this article. Keep on reading!

### Technical analysis

### ![LiteForex: Fundamental and technical analysis of Ethereum. Medium-
term scenario and trading plan.][4]

The chart above shows the [one-month time frame][5]. The impulse which
started in 2017 has been fully neutralized through a strong bearish
correction. The price of Ethereum dropped below the critical value of
370 USD, the level of 0.232 of the bullish impulse of 2016-2017. Thus,
the pattern of a 5-wave impulse hasn’t formed and the pair is unlikely
to grow actively in the framework of the global super cycle.

The level of 370 became the key level for confirming a bullish scenario.
So we can’t speak of Ethereum’s stable long-term growth as long as the
price is below this level.

![LiteForex: Fundamental and technical analysis of Ethereum. Medium-term
scenario and trading plan.][6]

The same time frame is displayed in the chart above. I’ve added the TM
annual candlestick’s projection into it. The upper limit of the
projection is located at 245 USD and the maximum growth L2+ is at 291
USD. Since Ether’s price has been crossing the upper limit of TM
tolerance zone at 168 USD marked as a purple rectangle, a retracement to
the above mentioned maximums is very likely to occur.

scenario and trading plan.][7]

I’ve marked all important key levels in the weekly chart above.

First, there were large sale volumes at the end of February starting
from the level of 280 USD. Those volumes weren’t covered with buying.
So, the current market is a bearish one. The bearish trading channel is
confirmed with buyers’ pullbacks from the lower limit. Thus, we may say
that the price chart will continue developing within this channel. Also,
we have strong support levels at 89.80 USD (minimum of 2010) and 80.56
USD (minimum of 2018). These two levels form a strong support area and
they are attractive for buyers. Also, there is a strong level of frontal
volumes at 135 USD and the minimum of 2019 at 100 USD. This area serves
as the first defence line for bulls.

The whole area of buyers is marked as a red oval. It’s where long
positions should be considered.

scenario and trading plan.][8]

There are no big volumes on the part of buyers on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) chart. So,
we can characterize the current movement as a bullish correction in a
bearish market. A strong traded channel and 0.5 of the ultimate bearish
wave are located at 180-190 USD. This area is the nearest resistance
level. An even stronger resistance area is located near 4 levels:

the upper limit of the global bearish channel, 0.232 fib of the ultimate
bearish wave, the resistance levels based on Pivot points and the
maximum value of the candlestick projection. Considering all the key
levels, the limits of this area are between 240 and 260 USD.

### Actual scenario

### ![LiteForex: Fundamental and technical analysis of Ethereum. Medium-
term scenario and trading plan.][9]

The charts above show that the price has broken out the ascending
bullish channel marked as a blue dotted line. Probably, there will be a
short retest of support levels in the above mentioned area of 135-100
USD and a W-like local trough will form.

If we suppose that point B of a harmonious pattern has already formed
and consider the support and resistance levels and the ratio of sides,
we’ll have the bearish Bat pattern.

You can [check][10] my article on harmonious patterns for more
information.

My trading plan is the following:

Long: buy Ethereum at 100-135 USD. Stop Loss below point A at 89 USD.
Intermediate target near point B at 175 USD.

Closure at around 240 USD.

Short: sell Ethereum at 240 USD.

Stop Loss above 260 USD.

Primary target at around 180 USD.

Fixation near point C (hasn’t formed yet).

###  **Conclusion**

In the long term, Ethereum looks weak and isn’t interesting for
investment. There are no powerful buyers or a strong basis for growth.
Still, there will always be some demand for this asset because there’s a
variety of [smart contract](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/smart-contract-on-blockchain/)s in Ethereum’s [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/), including
stablecoins whose turnover is constantly growing.  Those tools will
maintain Ether’s minimum liquidity. So, Ethereum may be interesting for
medium-term and short-term trades as it’s a highly liquid tool traded in
clearly seen channels. Also, it observes support and resistance levels.
