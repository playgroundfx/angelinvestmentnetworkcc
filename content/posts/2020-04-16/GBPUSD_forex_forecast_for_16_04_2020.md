Pound sees a light shining in the cloudsDmitri Demidenko

## The pandemic changed the game rules for the GBP/USD

Everything has its bright side. Coronavirus made [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s forget about
Brexit, which drew the GBP up to its monthly high versus the US dollar.
However, the [GBPUSD][1] bulls may not celebrate their victory in the
long term. Poor reports on the US industrial production and retail sales
forecasts that the jobless claims will exceed 20 million over 4 weeks
and that the Chinese GDP will be at least 6% down in the first quarter
have stopped the rally of the stock indexes.

Over the past few years, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s got used to the fact that sterling is
rather responsive to any [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) bit about Brexit, but it often ignores the
UK domestic data. The Pandemic has greatly changed the rules of the
game. Investors didn’t react to the information that the Prime
Minister's lead negotiator David Frost would continue the talks with his
counterpart Michel Barnier. The meeting will be held as a video
conference. Three rounds of talks should have finished by now, but the
coronavirus epidemic has changed the plans. According to Standard Bank,
Brexit is now seen as a kind of light in the dark clouds for the pound.
Investors are growing confident that either the transition period will
be extended, or the UK will receive more benefits than it was thought
before.

The UK Cabinet ministers reject public requests to extend the transition
period, citing the commitment to fulfill the will of people. The Office
for Budget Responsibility said that, in the 2020/21 tax year, public
borrowing would increase by £218 billion to £273 billion amid the
coronavirus, the budget deficit should expand to 14% of GDP ( higher
than the 10% level hit after the global financial crisis that began in
2007). The budget spending will increase by £88 billion, while the tax
revenues will be 15% down, which is equivalent to £130 billion. The UK
economy could plunge by 35% in the second quarter alone, the total loss
for 2020 will be 13%.

 **Dynamics of the UK GDP**

Sterling’s strength is quite surprising considering the fact that the UK
economy is vulnerable to foreign risks due to a significant current
account deficit, Brexit uncertainty still exists, and the UK could be
the worst affected by the coronavirus country in Europe. After all,
during a global recession, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s usually prefer a single currency to
buy, the US dollar, while domestic drivers for forex rates become of
secondary importance. The pandemic outweighed the Brexit matters, but it
hasn’t solved the political problems weighing on the sterling. Even if
the Brexit deal is signed at the last moment, there will be a period of
uncertainty ahead of the agreement, which is likely to prevent the
[GBPUSD][1] from a sharp rally.

In the short-term, the [GBPUSD][1] trend will be determined by the
information from the USA and the [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) about the global epidemiological
situation. In my opinion, exiting longs for US stocks, as it is yet too
early to expect the S&P 500 steady rally, may result in the GBP/USD
consolidation in the range of 1.22-1.26.
