Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 23.02.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

The Bitcoin and Ethereum must have completed the impulse waves.
Therefore, the BTCUSD and the ETHUSD should be declining in the
corrective waves.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

The market must have finished the long upward impulse 3, composed of
five sub-waves, and the Bitcoin price is declining in the corrective
wave 4. Wave 4, according to its inner structure, is unfolding as double
zigzag [w]-[x]-[y]. In the near future, there should be developing wave
[y] to a level 45770.00, which is the low made by the correction [4].
Next, the market should start rising in the impulse wave.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Sell 52083.00, TP 45770.00

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

There continues forming the corrective wave [B] as a triple zigzag. The
sub-waves (w)-(x)-(y)-(xx) have been completed. The second linking wave
(xx) is a triple zigzag. There is forming the bullish wave (z) as a
standard zigzag a-b-c. The down correction b should soon end, and the
price will start rising in the final impulse c to a level of 0.670, as
it is outlined in the chart.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] today:

Buy 0.539, TP 0.670

## Elliott wave Ethereum analysis

The market must have finished the upward impulse wave C, which is a part
of the global zigzag A-B-C. Over the next few weeks, there should be
forming a new bearish trend. Based on the initial part o the down wave,
there is forming a zigzag-shaped wave [W], which is the first sub-wave
in a double or triple zigzag. Impulse wave (A) and correction (B) look
complete, and the (C) impulse is still forming. It could end at a level
1480.00, where correction (iv) ended. Next, the Ethereum price should
start rising in the linking wave [X].

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Sell 1696.42, TP 1480.00
