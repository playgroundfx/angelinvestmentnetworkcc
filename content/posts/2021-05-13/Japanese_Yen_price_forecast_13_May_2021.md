Yen returns to traditional values. Forecast as of 13.05.2021Dmitri
Demidenko

The Japanese currency has repeatedly proved its status as an outsider in
2021. When the global economy recovering and bond yields rising in the
US and Europe, [USDJPY][1] and [EURJPY][2] bears are having a hard time.
Let's discuss the market outlook and make up a trading plan

## Fundamental Japanese Yen forecast for six months

How quickly time flies! It would seem that quite recently, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s
were surprised at Donald Trump's eccentric antics and built strategies
with trade wars in mind. A year ago, the [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) about the pandemic caused
them a headache, but now the traditional factors, unemployment, and
inflation, influence the Forex price formation, the dynamics of which
makes it possible to clarify the positions of the Fed and other central
banks. The proof is the reaction of financial instruments to US jobs
report and consumer prices. In both cases, the [USDJPY][1] pair was at
the epicenter of events.

The insignificant increase in US employment compared to Bloomberg
experts' forecasts is improving the demand for bonds and indicates that
the economy has not yet recovered. On the contrary, the spike in
consumer prices to 4.2%, the highest level since 2008, makes bondholders
sell bonds. In an era of high inflation, the cost of interest payments
on debt goes down. Moreover, the Fed may abandon its passive [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) and
raise rates. The unstable dynamics of Treasury yields made [the
USDJPY][1] price jump up and down. At the same time, the strategy of
[buying USDJPY above 108.2][3] has already brought profit twice in half
a month.

### Dynamics of [USDJPY][1] and US bond yields

As I have said many times before, the yen's exchange rate depends on
external factors much more than on internal ones due to the BOJ's yield
targeting [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). According to the Board of Governors, Japan's economy
is recovering thanks to strong global demand, while slow vaccinations
are holding back GDP growth. According to the Daiwa Institute of
Research, the figure may decline again in the third quarter, if the
government does not lift the restrictions imposed in May.

The weak economy is forcing [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s to buy local bonds and makes it
easier for the BoJ to keep rates on 10-year securities in the +/- 0.25%
range. The stability of debt yields is forcing the [USDJPY][1] and
[EURJPY][2] prices to react to events in the US and Europe. And if a lot
has already been said about the economic boom in the US, then the
acceleration of vaccination in the EU allows being optimistic about the
euro's future.

According to the Governor of the Bank of Spain, Pablo Hernández de Cos,
if the speed of the vaccination campaign continues to increase, one
should count on the acceleration of the eurozone's economic growth in
the coming quarters. His colleague from the Netherlands, Klaas Knot,
believes that the GDP of the currency bloc can grow not by 4% in 2021,
as predicted by the ECB, but more. I believe that positive surprises
from European statistics in the coming weeks will benefit the Governing
Council's hawks and push the [EURJPY][2] prices even higher.

### [EURJPY][2] trading plan for six months

I have said more than once that the yen is one of the main G10 outsiders
this year. My bullish [EURJPY][2] targets regularly reach targets I
previously set, and afterward, they need to be raised. [In March][4], I
expected the pair to rise to levels 132 and 134. Now, I believe that
buyers will be able to reach level 135.2 by the end of 2021. I recommend
holding and adding up to long positions.
