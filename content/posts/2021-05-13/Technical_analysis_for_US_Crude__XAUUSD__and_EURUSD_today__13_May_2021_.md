Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 13.05.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

The short-term euro uptrend reversed down after the publication of the
US inflation data, which frightened [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

Yesterday, following the short-term uptrend the price reached level
66.54, which serves as the second upside target for oil purchases. The
trading model for buying in the key support zone 64.14 - 63.88 fully
worked out.

Today, there are new targets: support levels in which it is possible to
look for new purchases. One of these supports is Additional Zone 65.29 -
65.16. Traders are currently testing the zone. Watch the market and look
for an opportunity to buy oil with the target at 66.42.

If the Additional Zone is broken out, then the correction will continue
with the target at the trend border 63.91.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

  1. Buy according to the pattern in Additional Zone 65.29 - 65.16. TakeProfit: 66.42. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. Buy according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 63.97 - 63.70. TakeProfit: 66.42. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

The short-term gold uptrend continues. The traders are testing the key
support 1823 - 1820. The price hasn't yet broken out the zone, but it
may be a matter of time.

In any case, according to the methodology, it is too early to take any
action on gold. Further development of the situation will show which
trade should be entered.

The formation of a buy pattern in the Intermediary Zone will allow
opening a long trade with the target at level 1842. A breakout of the
Intermediary Zone and the closing of the price below at the US trading
session will make it profitable to sell gold with a target at the lower
Target Zone 1800 - 1796.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

Buy according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 1823 - 1820.
TakeProfit: 1842, Target Zone 2 1861 - 1856. StopLoss: according to the
pattern rules.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

The short-term euro uptrend reversed down after the publication of the
US inflation data, which frightened [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s. The CPI value was 3.0% in
annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/), which turned out to be much higher than analysts'
expectations of 2.3% and higher than the previous value of 1.6%.

The short-term EURUSD uptrend reversed down due to the publication of
the strong inflation data. Yesterday, the Intermediary Zone 1.2093 -
1.2084 was broken out. The Target Zone 1.2005 - 1.1988 will serve as the
target for sales for the rest of the week.

It is profitable to look for euro sales in the zone of 1.2162 - 1.2110.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

Open sell positions according to the pattern in 1.2163 - 1.2110.
TakeProfit: Target Zone 1.2093 - 1.2084. StopLoss: according to the
pattern rules.
