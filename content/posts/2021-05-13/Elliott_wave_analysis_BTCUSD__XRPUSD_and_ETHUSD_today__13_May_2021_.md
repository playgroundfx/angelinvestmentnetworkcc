Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 13.05.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

Ripple has completed the corrective pattern, so the price should be
rising in the impulse

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

The BTCUSD market must be forming the initial part of the bear impulse
wave. There have completed two sub-waves 1 and 2, so there should be
unfolding the third wave as an impulse (1)-(2)-(3)-(4)-(5). The Bitcoin
price should be declining to a level of 47000.00 and lower. One could
enter sell trades.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Sell 50520.50, TP 47000.00

* * *

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

The market should be developing the first part of a large bullish
impulse, wave (1). Wave (1) is unfolding as a five-wave impulse composed
of the sub-waves 1-2-3-4-5. The market could have finished the deep
corrective wave 4 as a triple combination [W]-[X]-[Y]-[X]-[Z], so the
Ripple price should rising in the final wave 5 to a level of 1.961,
marked by a large wave [1].

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] today:

Buy 1.343, TP 1.961

* * *

## Elliott wave Ethereum analysis

The most recent ETHUSD price chart section displays the diagonal
(1)-(2)-(3)-(4)-(5), which must have concluded the global impulse wave
C. Next, the price turned down and started declining. There should be
developing a new bear trend and the price should go down to a level
below 3352.00. Therefore, one could enter a sell trade a the current
price with a target at level 3352.00.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Sell 4000.17, TP 3352.00
