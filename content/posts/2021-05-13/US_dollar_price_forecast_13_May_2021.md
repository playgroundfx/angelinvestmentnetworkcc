Dollar plays with time. Forecast as of 13.05.2021Dmitri Demidenko

After the release of the US CPI data, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are concerned about how
temporary will be the inflation acceleration. If the Fed is wrong, will
it raise rates earlier than expected? Let us discuss the Forex outlook
and make up a [EURUSD][1] trading plan.

## Weekly US dollar fundamental forecast

There is nothing more permanent than temporary. The financial markets'
reaction to the significant rise in consumer prices has proven that
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s doubt the Fed's mantra of a short-term boost in inflation. The
Treasury yield has had the best [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) rise since February, and the
correction of stock indices continued. After hitting the 26th and 24th
all-time highs in 2021 by the [S&P 500][2] and the [Dow Jones][3] in the
week ended May 7, they featured their worst three-day drop in nearly
seven months. So the greenback has naturally strengthened.

The consumer price growth by 4.2% in April was the fastest since
September 2008; core inflation rose by 3%, the most significant growth
since 1995. It surprised even Fed Vice President Richard Clarida. The
report has been hot but not overheated. The Federal Reserve will not
change its [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) because of a single strong report. Clarida noted that
CPI has increased and is likely to rise a little more before falling at
the end of the year. However, in 2022-2023, the indicator will return to
the target of 2% or slightly higher.

### Dynamics of US inflation

The Fed Vice President stressed that the central bank would continue to
monitor inflationary expectations closely. If the situation does not
develop in accordance with its baseline forecast, it will immediately
intervene.

After the US inflation report, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s wonder how long inflation
pressure will last. Atlanta Fed chair Raphael Bostic expects increased
CPI volatility until September. On condition of anonymity, White House
officials told Bloomberg that inflation volatility would last till the
end of the year. Republicans criticizing Joe Biden for the negative
impact of fiscal stimulus on employment argue that this is not a
temporary phenomenon. This is the type of thing that will start to
change inflationary expectations.

After such surprises from employment and consumer prices (the
discrepancy in the forecasts of Bloomberg experts and the actual data on
the first indicator turned out to be a record, on the second - the
widest since 1996), I would not be surprised if not only Republicans but
also some Democrats begin to doubt the advisability of additional aid
packages of $4 trillion. If Congress does not approve the new stimulus
package, the US stock indexes could continue falling, strengthening the
dollar.

However, I believe the [EURUSD][1] drop after the US inflation report
has been too deep. Supply disruptions will be eliminated, and people
getting back to work will reduce the gap between the demand for goods
and services and their supply. I do not think that the Fed will abandon
its mantra about the temporary nature of the acceleration of consumer
prices. Otherwise, the Fed’s authority will be undermined. Norges Bank,
for example, doesn’t raise the interest rate, although inflation in the
country has been above the target of 2% for more than a year.

### Weekly [EURUSD][1] trading plan

The Fed is likely to remain passive, so it will be relevant to buy the
[EURUSD][1] when the price returns to a level above 1.211.
