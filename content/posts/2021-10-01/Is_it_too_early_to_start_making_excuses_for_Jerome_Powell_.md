The Fed prepares for a fall. Review as of 01.10.2021Dmitri Demidenko

Is it too early to start making excuses for Jerome Powell?

## Dollar's rise shows that markets have already decided what the
central bank will do in 2022

When I was little, my father took me in a boat far from the coast and
threw me overboard. I swam to the land and reported my father to the
police. That was how I learned to write. Markets sometimes need to be
exposed to extreme conditions for the shock [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s experience to
teach them something. At least calmness. If in 2013 Ben Bernanke caused
hysteria with a message about the collapse of QE, then in 2021 Jerome
Powell, hinting on a reduction in asset purchases in November, provoked
only a slight sickness in the financial markets. Yes, Treasury yields
are growing. Yes, stocks are falling. But the scale of the correction
cannot be compared with the events of 8 years ago!

Jerome Powell's speech to Congress was confusing. Before him, several
FOMC officials said they were confident in the temporary nature of high
inflation, while the Fed chairman began to talk about the imperfection
of the models used by the central bank; that he cannot control the
process of supply disruptions; finally, that in 2022 inflation may
remain at high levels. It will be extremely difficult for the Fed to
deal with high PCE and underemployment at the same time. What does that
mean? Does Powell prepare the ground, suggesting that he could fall? By
fall I mean starting raising rates and driving the economy into a new
recession. But he doesn't even know if he will stay at the helm of the
Fed.

If the horses have done everything so that they cannot be changed, then
the crossing will never end. The chair under the Republican, who was
appointed to the office by former US President Donald Trump, has started
shaking seriously. Some Democrats believe that Powell, who has
repeatedly voted in favour of Wall Street de[regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/), is a dangerous
man who may lead the economy to another recession. And Joe Biden
desperately needs the votes of these Democrats to get the new fiscal
stimulus package through Congress. How will the president solve this
problem?

Markets got used to Powell, he calmed them down and in March 2020
performed a real feat by dropping the federal funds rate to zero and
launching a colossal QE. The Fed chairman has become the messiah but his
opponents argue that the central bank's success in saving the economy
was an accident. Nevertheless, the US fell into a huge pit, and one of
those who pulled the country out was Jerome Powell. This must be
remembered.

I would like to believe that the Fed chairman will remain for a second
term. He has a difficult job to do. How to reduce inflation and make
sure that the economy does not lose steam? Sometimes, after all, you
start to slow down so hard that you stop entirely. Judging by the
reaction of the financial markets, the Fed has already made its choice.
The rise in Treasury yields and the strengthening of the US dollar
signal an aggressive monetary restriction in 2022. Let them not repeat
the mistakes of their predecessors!
