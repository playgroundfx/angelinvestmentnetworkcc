Keep smiling, dollar! Forecast as of 01.10.2021Dmitri Demidenko

The worst performance of American stock indices since March 2020 and the
Fed's intention to normalize monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) allowed the greenback to
experience the most rapid growth since September last year. What's next?
Let's discuss and make up a trading plan for [EUR/USD][1].

## Weekly US dollar fundamental forecast

It's hard to resist the charm of the dollar. Especially when it finds
support on both sides of its smile. September turned out to be the worst
month for US stocks since March 2020, and the greenback received more
attention as a safe haven asset. At its most recent meeting, the Fed
signalled that the QE would be closing down in November, and the USD
index saluted it with its best monthly increase in a year. Despite the
differences in recessions, the dollar smile theory is alive and well and
it does not allow the bears on [EUR/USD][1] to raise their heads.

When storms shake the economy and financial markets, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s flee to
safe havens buying US currency. Then there comes a period of weakness
due to the massive monetary stimulus of the Fed taking on the role of
messiah. As soon as GDP recovers and the time comes to normalize
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), the greenback begins to grow again. This is how the
dollar smile is formed. The use of it allowed me to quite accurately
predict the dynamics of [EUR/USD][1] over the past year and a half.

What's next? Looking at the fact that the Fed is beginning to doubt the
mantra about the temporary nature of high inflation, it can be assumed
that we are on the verge of an aggressive increase in the federal funds
rate in 2022, which will allow the main currency pair to continue its
journey to the south towards 1.1. Indeed, prices in the United States
are rising much faster than in other developed countries. How can you
not start to get nervous?

### Inflation dynamics

Jerome Powell is already preparing for a retreat, arguing that the Fed
is unable to control supply bottlenecks. He acknowledges that the
central bank will face a very hard challenge in 2022. Typically, when
inflation is high, the unemployment rate is low, so the rate hike is
painless for the economy. Now it's far from full employment, and price
increases are skyrocketing. It is necessary to normalize monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
so as not to damage GDP.

The Fed has only one hope: that the temporary factors pushing PCE upward
will disappear on their own, and this will allow for very slow rate
hikes. Otherwise, you can go back to the past. The 1970s, with their
double-digit inflation and interest rates, high unemployment and
extremely slow economic recovery from recurring reсessions. Such a
scenario is possible, but it should be noted that now the UK is much
closer to stagflation than the United States, which leads to a collapse
of the pound.

There is a similar situation in Germany, where the CPI jumped to a
29-year peak of 4.1% in September, and workers went on strike to insist
on higher wages. There are certain risks that their demands will trigger
a self-fulfilling inflationary spiral in the largest economy in the
eurozone, and the ECB will have nothing to do but raise the rates
earlier than in 2024.

### Weekly [EUR/USD][1] trading plan

2022 will be very exciting. So far, [EUR/USD][1] is trying to find the
bottom near the previously indicated targets at 1.1555 - 1.1565. Perhaps
it's time for you and me to take a break in selling?
