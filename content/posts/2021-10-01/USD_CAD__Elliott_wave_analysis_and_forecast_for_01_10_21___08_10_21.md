USD/CAD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 01.10.21 – 08.10.21Alex
Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 1.2893 with a target of 1.2478 – 1.2367.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
1.2893 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 1.3090 –
1.3250.

 **Analysis:** A descending correction appears to have formed as the
fourth wave 4 of larger degree on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) chart, with wave (С) of 4
completed and wave 5 developing inside. On the H4 chart, wave 1 of (1)
of 5 formed and a descending correction is developing as wave 2 of (1)
of 5 with wave b of 2 formed inside. On the H1 chart, apparently, wave c
of 2 is forming, with the first wave of smaller degree (i) of c
completed, a local correction (ii) of c formed and wave (iii) of c
developing inside. If the presumption is correct, the pair will continue
to drop to the levels of 1.2478 – 1.2367. The level of 1.2893 ****is
critical in this scenario as a breakout will enable the pair to continue
rising to the levels of 1.3090 – 1.3250.
