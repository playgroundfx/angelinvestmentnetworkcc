XAUUSD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 01.10.21 – 08.10.21Alex
Geuta

 **Main scenario:** long positions will be relevant above the level of
1719.63 with a target of 1915.00 – 2075.27 once a correction has formed.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
1719.63 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of
1673.63 – 1602.20.

 **Analysis:** an ascending third wave of larger degree (3) is formed on
the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) chart, and a descending correction developed as the fourth
wave (4) and, supposedly, the fifth wave (5) started forming.
Apparently, on the H4 chart, the first wave of smaller degree 1 of (5)
formed, the correction wave 2 of (5) formed as well and wave 3 of (5)
started developing. On the H1 chart, supposedly, a local correction in
the form of wave ii of 3 as a double zigzag (w)(x)(y) finished
developing and wave iii of 3 started forming. If the presumption is
correct, the pair will continue to rise to the levels of 1915.00 –
2075.27 once the correction is over. The level of 1719.63 ****is
critical in this scenario as a breakout will enable the pair to continue
declining to the levels of 1673.63 – 1602.20.
