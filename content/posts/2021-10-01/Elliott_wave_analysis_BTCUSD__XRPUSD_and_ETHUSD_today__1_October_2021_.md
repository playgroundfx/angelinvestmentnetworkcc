Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 01.10.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

In the short term, all three cryptocurrencies expect a bearish impulse.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

The BTCUSD market is developing the initial part of a bearish wave in
the form of an impulse. Sub-waves (1) -(2) have been completed. Now a
sub-wave (3) is unfolding, while only its first half can be seen. It
seems that the market has completed impulse 1 and correction 2, so in
the near future expect the pair to drop within sub-wave 3 below the
level of 39500.00. One could enter sell trades in the current situation.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Sell 43657.00, TP 39500.00

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

The XRPUSD is developing a new bearish sub-wave, within which the market
formed the first two parts, sub-waves 1 and 2. Also, two sub-waves of a
smaller degree, impulse [1] and correction [2], are currently unfolding.
Shortly the price should continue to decline within sub-wave [3] below
the level of 0.805. One could enter sell trades in the current
situation.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] **** today:

Sell 0.951, TP 0.805

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

The ETHUSD, like other major cryptocurrencies, is declining during the
initial part of the bearish impulse. Most likely, the initial part of a
large impulse sub-wave 3 is under development. So far, only the first
two parts, sub-waves [1] and [2], have been completed. Over the next few
days, the price may fall and the sub-wave [3] may develop below the
price level of 2643.00. In the current situation, it is profitable to
enter sales.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Sell 3004.09 TP 2643.00
