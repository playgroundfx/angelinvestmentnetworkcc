GBPUSD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 01.10.21 – 08.10.21Alex
Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 1.3750 with a target of 1.3157 – 1.2821.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
1.3750 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 1.4050 –
1.4241.

 **Analysis:** Daily chart: the first wave of larger degree (1) is
formed and a downside correction continues forming as wave (2). H4
chart: wave А of (2) is completed and wave B of (2) appears to have
formed, with wave c of B formed inside. Apparently, wave C of (2)
started developing on the H1 chart with the first wave of smaller degree
i of C forming inside. If the presumption is correct, the pair will
continue declining to the levels of 1.3157 – 1.2821. The level of 1.3750
is critical in this scenario as a breakout will enable the pair to
continue rising to the levels of 1.4050 – 1.4241.
