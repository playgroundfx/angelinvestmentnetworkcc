Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 01.10.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

Yesterday, the short-term gold trend reversed up after breaking out the
key resistance 1744 - 1742.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

The oil key support hasn't been broken out, but within the upward
impulse yesterday, the traders did not manage to break out the
resistance 75.79 - 75.53. Now the oil price is moving away from
yesterday's high and slowly approaching the key support of the short-
term uptrend 73.95 - 73.69.

If the key support is broken out with a consolidation below today, then
the trend will reverse down. In this case, sell oil next week with the
target at the lower Target Zone 71.40 - 70.89.

The breakout of the resistance 75.79 - 75.53 is required to enter
purchases. In this case, the price will move towards the zone of ​​78.59
- 77.42.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

Yesterday, the short-term gold trend reversed up after breaking out the
key resistance 1744 - 1742 and reaching the Target Zone 1767 - 1763.
After reaching the Target Zone, major traders exited longs, and the
price went into correction.

At the moment sellers are trying to break out the support zone 1753 -
1752 which is the Additional Zone. It is profitable to enter purchases
in the AZ according to the pattern with a target at yesterday's high.

If the Additional Zone is broken out downside, then the correction will
continue with the target in the Intermediary Zone.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

Buy according to the pattern in Additional Zone 1753 - 1752. TakeProfit:
1764. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

Yesterday, as part of the short-term downtrend, the euro set a new low
and, as close as possible, approached the Target Zone 2 1.1557 - 1.1539.
Now the price is moving away from local lows, approaching the resistance
at 1.1592.

Breakout of level 1.1592 will allow reaching the Additional Zone 1.1611
- 1.1607. The Additional Zone is responsible for the short-term euro
trend. Breakout of this resistance will allow considering purchases up
to the Intermediary Zone 1.1659 - 1.1650.

If the bears hold the Additional Zone, then look for euro sales with the
target at today's low of 1.1565.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

Sell according to the pattern in Additional Zone 1.1611 - 1.1607.
