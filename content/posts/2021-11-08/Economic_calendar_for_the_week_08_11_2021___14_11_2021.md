Economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the week 08.11.2021 – 14.11.2021Jana Kane

##  **Review of the main events of the Forex economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the
next trading week (08.11.2021 – 14.11.2021)**

Despite the fact that the US employment report was strong and the values
were better than in the previous two months, the dollar was also unable
to develop its upward trend after the publication of the report last
Friday.

The DXY dollar index even slightly declined last Friday, although it
still managed to close last week in positive territory, adding about 10
points at the end of the week (less than 0.1%).

The October report of the US Department of Labor indicated an increase
in the Non-Farm Payrolls in the US by +531 thousand and a drop in
unemployment to 4.6% from 4.8% in September.

In addition, the number of non-farm jobs in the United States rose by
312,000 in September, up from the 194,000 previously reported.

At the same time, the share of the economically active population,
according to the Ministry of Labor, was 61.6% in October.

On Thursday, gold rose in price by 1.7% against the background of a
decrease in the yield of Treasury bonds, caused by the Fed's decision on
Wednesday to begin to cut the asset purchase program. In addition, the
central bank has signaled that it will be patient with raising interest
rates. On Friday, the growth of gold quotes continued, despite a strong
report from the US Department of Labor, and the price of gold broke
through the mark of $1,816.00 per ounce.

The low share of the economically active population and the acceleration
of inflation make market participants worry about the growth rate of the
American economy.

Now, next week, market participants will be monitoring the publication
of the US CPI and PPI.

But the conclusion that can be drawn from the Fed meeting that ended
last week is that the US central bank will not rush to raise interest
rates: the labor market has not fully recovered yet, and the Fed leaders
still consider increased inflation to be a temporary phenomenon.

At the same time, the heads of the Fed still approved a plan to wind up
the asset purchase program. The Fed will cut bond purchases by 15
billion in November and another 15 billion in December. In the opinion
of its management, such a reduction in the volume of acquired assets "is
likely to be appropriate every month."

Also next week, market participants will pay attention to the
publication of important macro statistics from China, Germany,
Australia, and the UK.

 ***during the coming week, new events may be added to the [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) and
/ or some scheduled events may be canceled**

 ****GMT time**

###  **Monday, November 8**

No important macro statistics scheduled to be released.

###  **Tuesday, November 9**

###  **22:45 CAD Speech by Tiff Macklem, head of the Bank of Canada**

The Canadian economy, as well as the entire global economy, slowed down
in 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic. Earlier, Tiff Macklem said that
the country's economy was quite stable. However, the situation has
changed rapidly, and not for the better. It will be interesting now to
hear Macklem's opinion on the sustainability of the Canadian economy and
the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the central bank.

If Macklem touches on the topic of the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the Bank of
Canada, the volatility in the quotes of the Canadian dollar will rise
sharply. His tough tone will help strengthen the Canadian dollar. The
soft rhetoric of his speech and the propensity for soft monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
will negatively affect the CAD quotes.

He will probably also explain the recent Bank of Canada decision on the
interest rate and may provide some guidance for [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s ahead of the
next meeting of the central bank.

###  **Wednesday, November 10**

###  **01:30 CNY Consumer Price Index (CPI)**

The National Bureau of Statistics of China will release another monthly
set of data reflecting the dynamics of consumer prices in China. Rising
consumer prices could trigger an acceleration in inflation, which could
force the People's Bank of China to take measures aimed at tightening
fiscal [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). Increased growth in consumer inflation may cause
appreciation of the yuan, a weak result will put pressure on the yuan.

China's economy, according to various estimates, is already the largest
in the world, pushing the US economy into second place. Therefore, the
publication of important macroeconomic indicators of this country has a
significant impact on world financial markets, primarily on the
positions of the yuan, other Asian currencies, the dollar, commodity
currencies, as well as on Chinese and Asian stock indices. China is the
largest buyer of raw materials and a supplier of a wide range of
finished products to the world commodity market.

In January 2021, the growth of the consumer inflation index amounted to
+1.0% (-0.3% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)), in February +0.6% (-0.2% in annual
[terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)), in May -0.2% (+1.3% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)), and in September 0% (+
0.7% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)).

Deterioration of macroeconomic indicators, including a decrease in
consumer inflation, may negatively affect the positions of the yuan, as
well as commodity currencies such as the Canadian, Australian, and New
Zealand dollars. To a greater extent, this applies to the Australian
dollar, since China is Australia's largest trade and economic partner.

According to the forecast, the Consumer Price Index is expected to grow
by +0.6% in October (+1.4% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)).

The rise in the consumer inflation index will have a positive effect on
the quotes of the yuan, as well as commodity currencies. However, the
data is worse than forecast and the relative decline in CPI may
negatively affect them.

###  **07:00 EUR Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) in Germany
(final edition)**

This index is published by the EU Statistical Office and is calculated
on the basis of a statistical method agreed between all EU countries. It
is an indicator for assessing inflation and is used by the Governing
Council of the ECB to assess the level of price stability. A positive
result strengthens the EUR, a negative one weakens it. The preliminary
estimate was +4.6% in October. Previous indicator values: +4.1% in
September, +3.4% in August, +3.1% in July, +2.1% in June, +2.4% in May,
+2.1% in April, +2.0% in March, +1.6% in January and February, -0.7% in
December and negative values ​​in the second half of 2020 (in annual
[terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)). If the data turn out to be better than the previous values, the
euro may strengthen in the short term. The growth of the indicator is a
positive factor for the euro. The data suggests increasing inflationary
pressures in Germany. Data worse than the previous value will negatively
affect the euro.

###  **13:30 USD Consumer Price Index (ex food and energy)**

Consumer Price Index (CPI) determines the change in prices of a selected
basket of goods and services for a given period and is a key indicator
for assessing inflation and changes in consumer preferences. Food and
energy have been excluded from this indicator to provide a more accurate
estimate. A high score strengthens the US dollar, while a low score
weakens it. In September 2021, the value of the indicator was +0.2%
(+4.0% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)), in August +0.1% (+4.0% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)), in
July +0.3% (+4.3% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)), in June +0.9% (+4.5% in annual
[terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)), in May +0.7% (+3.8% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)), and in April +0.9% (+3.0%
in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)), which indicates some improvement in the situation
after the index fell in March and April 2020 amid the coronavirus
pandemic and the rise in consumer prices. If the data turns out to be
weaker than the forecast, the dollar is likely to respond with a short-
term decline. Better-than-forecast data will strengthen the dollar.
Outlook for October: +0.3% and +4.0% (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)), which is likely
to have a positive impact on the USD.

###  **Thursday, November 11**

In the United States, banks and exchanges will be closed due to the
celebration of the Veterans Day. Therefore, during the American trading
session, trading volumes will be low.

###  **00:30 AUD Employment rate. Unemployment rate**

The employment rate reflects the monthly change in the number of
Australian citizens employed. The growth of the indicator has a positive
impact on consumer spending, which stimulates economic growth. A high
reading is positive for the AUD, while a low reading is negative.
Forecast: in October, the number of employed Australian citizens
increased by 50,000 (after falling by -138,000 in September, -146,300 in
August, an increase of +2,200 in July, +29,100 in June, +115,200 in May,
a fall of -30,600 in April, by -264,100 in May 2020 and an increase of
+29,100 in January 2021).

Also at the same time, the Australian Bureau of Statistics will publish
a report on the unemployment rate - an indicator that estimates the
ratio of the unemployed population to the total number of able-bodied
citizens. The growth of the indicator indicates the weakness of the
labor market, which leads to a weakening of the national economy. The
decrease in the indicator is a positive factor for the AUD. Forecast:
unemployment in Australia in October was at 4.7% (against 4.6% in
September, 4.5% in August, 4.6% in July, 4.9% in June, 5.1% in May ,
5.5% in April, 6.6% in December, 6.8% in November, 7.0% in October, 6.9%
in September, 6.8% in August, 7.5% in July, 7.4% in June, 5.2% in March,
5.1% in February), although it is approaching pre-coronavirus levels.
Overall, the numbers look weak.

The leaders of the RBA have repeatedly stated that, in addition to the
situation in international trade, the Australian economy and the central
bank's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) plans are influenced by indicators of the level
of household debt and expenditures, the growth of workers' wages, as
well as the state of the country's labor market. In the opinion of the
RBA management, an unemployment rate of 4.5% or lower is required to
raise wages and accelerate inflation to the target range.

The AUD is unlikely to react positively to the publication of data from
the country's labor market. If the values ​​of the indicators turn out
to be worse than forecast, the Australian dollar may significantly
decline in the short term. Better-than-expected data will strengthen the
AUD in the short term.

###  **07:00 GBP UK 3rd Quarter GDP (first estimate)**

GDP is considered to be an indicator of the overall health of the
British economy. The upward trend in GDP is considered positive for the
GBP. The UK's GDP was one of the highest in the world until 2016, when
the Brexit referendum was held. Afterwards, its growth slowed down, and
with the onset of the global coronavirus pandemic, the growth rate of
British GDP went into negative territory altogether.

Previous GDP values: +5.5% (+23.6% in the 2nd quarter), a decline of
-1.6% in the 1st quarter of 2021, -19.8% in the 2nd quarter and growth
by +1.3% in Q4 2020). The main factors that can force the Bank of
England to keep rates low are weak GDP and labor market growth, as well
as low consumer spending. If the GDP data turns out to be significantly
worse than the previous values, it will put downward pressure on the
pound. Strong GDP report will strengthen the pound.

###  **Friday, November 12**

###  **15:00 USD University of Michigan Consumer Confidence Index
(preliminary release)**

This indicator reflects the confidence of American consumers in the
economic development of the country. A high level indicates economic
growth, while a low level indicates stagnation. Previous indicator
values: 71.7 in October, 72.8 in September, 70.3 in August, 81.2 in
July, 85.5 in June, 84.9 in March, 76.8 in February, 79.0 in January
2021. An increase in the indicator will strengthen the USD, while a
decrease in the value will weaken the dollar. The data indicate that the
recovery of this indicator is uneven, which is negative for the USD.
Data worse than previous values ​​may negatively affect the dollar in
the short term.
