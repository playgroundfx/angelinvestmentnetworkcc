Monero Price Prediction for the Years: 2021, 2023, 2025, 2030, and
BeyondJana Kane

[The Monero (XMR coin) price][1] has recently shown significant
fluctuations like any other cryptocurrency. The crypto’s future looks
bright, making it a relatively reliable addition to [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s' crypto
portfolios with a good Monero price target.

The article covers the following subjects:

Due to these price movements, Monero is the 40th coin of all
cryptocurrencies in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of value on Coinmarketcap at the time of
writing. In this article, we'll take a look at [Monero's future
price][1] predictions, covering the basics of the project and ending
with Monero's future price predictions from experts. Want to bet on the
high price expectations of Monero? Why is Monero going up

## What Is Monero?

The digital currency Monero (XMR) has been around since 2014 and has
seen a lot in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of price in recent years. But what is it that makes
Monero so special and distinguishes itself from the other larger and
more famous cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ripple?

How is it that the price of the Monero showed these beautiful upward
lines earlier this year, despite a critical decline in 2018 and why is
it moving sideways now? Monero is also referred to as the sleeping
crypto giant - and understandably so. In the information below, we
explain why this crypto coin is interesting and why it is important to
keep a close eye on the Monero price.

Monero is the leading cryptocurrency with an emphasis on privacy and
censorship-resistant transactions. Most existing cryptocurrencies,
including Bitcoin and Ethereum, have transparent [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/)s, meaning
that transactions are openly verifiable and traceable to anyone in the
world. In addition, sending and receiving addresses for these
transactions can potentially be linked to a person's real identity.

We have listed a number of important features that make the Monero
future so interesting and distinguish it from the other
cryptocurrencies::

  * Transactions with Monero are confidential and not traceable.

  * The Monero project is 100% decentralized.

  * Monero has a team of more than 240 experienced developers behind it.

  * Monero is scalable because it has no fixed size for a block.

  * Monero transactions are confidential and non-traceable.

  * By default, every Monero transaction hides the send and receive addresses and the amounts processed.

This always-on privacy measure means that any Monero user activity
enhances other users’ privacy, as opposed to selectively transparent
cryptocurrencies (e.g., Z-Cash). Monero is fungible.

This means that Monero is always accepted without the risk of
censorship. The Kovri project will track and encrypt transactions
through I2P Invisible Internet Project nodes. This obscures the IP
address of a transaction and provides further protection against network
surveillance.

Monero is a grassroots community that attracts the world's best
cryptocurrency researchers and tech talent. More than 240 developers
contributed to the Monero project, including 30 core developers. Forums
and chat channels are welcoming and active.

Monero's Research Lab, Core Development Team, and community developers
are constantly pushing the boundaries of what's possible with
cryptocurrency privacy and security.

Monero is not a company. It was developed by cryptography and
distributed systems experts from around the world who donate their time
or are funded through community donations. This means that Monero cannot
be closed by any country and is not limited by any particular legal
jurisdiction.

## Monero in the Past and the History of XMR

Monero’s all-time high is $517.62 ][2. The Monero price today is $273.30. This value is interactive; you’ll be able to refer to this article to see the current price tomorrow. 

In 2020, the price increased considerably compared to the year before,
but this year seems to be an even better year due to all the new
developments. At the time of writing (November 1, 2021), Monero’s market
cap was [$4,872,714,990][2].

Is Monero expected to rise? We will give you Monero [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/). But in order
to make the most reliable and realistic cryptocurrency predictions, it's
important not just to look ahead at the projection but also to look back
at the [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) price performance of Monero. Below you can see the
chart of how the price [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) of Monero changed over the years of its
existence.

### May 2014 - The Start of Monero

On May 21, 2014, Monero was launched on the crypto exchanges. The value
was set at $2.47 under the first name of BitMonero. This is a
combination of the word ''money'' in Esperanto and Bit from Bitcoin. The
coin flopped completely. Fans from the crypto community decided to take
over the project and launched Monero with the current name.

### Early 2015 - Historical Low

The initial appreciation turned out to be way too high. The price
dropped to $0.2130 on January 14, 2015 (Coinmarketcap), which was a
historic low for the currency.

### Late 2016 - Sudden Revival

At the end of 2016, things suddenly went underway. The currency shot to
13.60 dollars. This was the highest valuation of the coin at the time.

### 2017 - Growth Continues

2017 was a fantastic year for Monero. The growth continued and suddenly
reached a rate of around 130 dollars halfway through the year.

### 2017/2018 - Monero Goes Through the Ceiling

All virtual coins exploded, and so did Monero. The coin reached its
first [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) peak of  $495.84 (Coinmarketcap, January 7, 2018).

### End of 2018 - Back to Square One

Monero, like many other cryptos, dropped all the way back to the value
of 1.5 years before. With such a rate, many [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s lost some of their
confidence in the coin.

### 2020 - Monero Race: Back on Track

The rate of Monero is back on the rise. After closing 2019 with a
meaningless change, the coin now seems unstoppable. Because it is now
one of the older coins, with a good reputation in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of privacy, the
popularity of the coin is increasing enormously and [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s believe in
Monero potential. This can be seen in the price.

### 2021 - High Hopes

We can clearly see how Monero increased in value until the beginning of
May. The all-time high was set on May 07, 2021 - the price skyrocketed
to $517.62. But this record didn’t last long. Bitcoin crashed and
dragged down many other coins. It took just two weeks for Monero’s price
to fall to $175. This dreadful fall ended on July 20. Now it is trading
at good levels, despite the fact that the price has yet to reach its
previous record.

## Monero (XMR) Technical Analysis

To make a realistic forecast for Monero, we need to understand both a
general market picture and ongoing processes. Let's do a technical
analysis of the biggest time frame to determine global market sentiment
concerning the [XMRUSD][3].

The monthly chart above shows quite a short story, but there's a stable
bullish trend suggesting itself for Monero. Note that price growth and
volume growth take place simultaneously. The simultaneous growth of the
XMR price chart and the trading activity indicates that the long-term
bullish trend's potential is quite high, and it might continue in the
coming months.

### XMR Forecast for Next Three Months

To make a short-term forecast, let's do a technical analysis of the
weekly chart and have a more detailed picture.

We'll lay the Fibonacci grid over the upward movement pattern to single
out five development stages of the trend's lifespan:

  * 1 - trend start area and area of bulls' last hope;
  * 2 and 3 - price consolidation zones;
  * 4 - big area of intense growth;
  * 5 - area of peak values.

The Monero to USD price has stopped near the consolidation zone’s upper
limit recently. That's a powerful resistance level that has prevented an
upward movement at least two times this year.

Another important marker is the latest candle formed -- a shooting star
marked with the blue label. Such bars form before a reversal, especially
when they are formed amid relatively low volumes like in our case.

Using indicators, let's look for some more signals of a projected fall
on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) Monero price chart.

The chart above shows that the [RSI][4]'s curve pulled back from the
overbought area's limit the other day. At the same time, the [MACD][5]
histogram points to a bearish divergence. Those signals suggest that the
price may change its direction.

As XMR is in the consolidation area, we are unlikely to see any drastic
moves in the near time. However, the [Monero price][6] is very likely to
go down in the future. It will either reach the trend line at around 190
USD or stop somewhere between areas 1 and 2 in September.

Monero's expected trading range will most likely go from 250 to 350 USD
in the nearest three months.

### Long-Term Monero Analysis for 2021/2022

Let's examine the price [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) and do a more thorough analysis of
XMRUSD to make a realistic forecast for 2021/2022.



Using [[Bollinger Bands](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/bollinger-bands.html) projections][7], I marked projected price
directions and monthly price ranges for 2021 and 2022 on the chart
above.

The [Monero to USD][3] projected value will likely drop to 250 USD and
fluctuate from 250 to 300 US dollars for a while. Monero's bullish
potential is likely to show itself in winter 2022 as it did in spring
2021. The psychological level of 500 USD will be a projected price
target of a new bullish impulse.

As that level is powerful and located near [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) maximums, Monero
won't probably push above it. So, the trend line may be retested after a
subsequent fall, at higher levels at around 300 USD. The table below
presents XMR projected price ranges for the next twelve months.

#### Long-term trading plan for Monero

Here's a trading plan based on long-term analysis.



Monero's projected growth suggests two entry points. If the price
continues moving within the consolidation area, the perfect buy price
will be 250-260 US dollars.

Another trade in [XMRUSD][3] should be opened after a transition to the
area of dynamic development, at the very beginning of momentum, at
around 360 USD.

Stop Loss should be placed below the trading range and the level of 245
USD, in the bulls' last hope area.

The level of 490 USD can be the price target. The price will hardly
break through the level of 500 USD, but it is very likely to come close
to that level.

After a reversal, consider short positions on [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) highs, with the
price target in the consolidation zone and Stop Loss placed a bit above
500 USD. We'll talk about that more thoroughly at the end of the year.

## Monero Price Predictions by Experts for the rest of 2021

Let us reflect on the Monero (XMR) price prediction from major distinct
sources, which will give us a fairer idea:

Trading beasts predict that Monero’s average price won’t fall below $290
until the end of the year. Moreover, the price should go up to $300 at
the end of November. The last day of 2021 should see it at $352.285.

November is expected to close with $278. No significant growth will
happen during the last two months of 2021. December will end with $282.

According to experts from the Coin Price Forecast, Monero won’t reach
$300 this year - December will leave us with $297.

According to the Wallet Investor, the price won’t change much in
November and December. 2022 will greet us with a Monero price of
$248.544.

## Monero Price Prediction for 2022

Predictions for 2022 differ a lot. Some experts are not optimistic and
don’t see Monero as having a chance of even reaching $300, yet others
believe that it will increase beyond $500.

The price in January will stay around $340-$350. It will cross the $400
mark in April, but at the end of June, it will fall to $388.887. Another
uptrend will be seen in the second part of 2022, but this time it will
stick. The last day of 2022 will be marked with a price of $502.547.

As you can see from the table above, 2022 is going to be quite an
uneventful year. The price will remain around $250 without any
significant ups or downs. The last few months show an insignificant
downtrend - the price will be $243.433, compared to $250 in June and
July.

January 2022 will begin at $282. During the first part of the year, the
price will go up and down quite often. However, by the end of June, it
will stabilize and will remain at $238. The second part of the year is
going to bring a more stable growth and take the price up to $369 on the
last day of December.

The year 2022 will begin with $297. The price will go up slightly and
reach $311 by the middle of the year, but a decline will follow.
December will leave us with $273.

## Monero Price Prediction: 2023 – 2024

A new record of $800? Or will Monero barely reach above $300? Only time
will tell. Most predictions don’t give huge numbers. However, stable
growth is expected.

Wallet Investor provides an optimistic forecast through 2023. The year
begins with the price of $504.942. After a series of up- and downtrends,
the price will be $537.715 at the end of June. November is expected to
bring a new record - the $600 line will be crossed. The last day of 2023
will see a high of $653.180.

In 2024, the price will begin to fall. However, April 2024 will be
marked with the first crossing of the $700 line. The price won’t hold
such a great position for very long - July 2024 will begin with
$687.038. The $700 threshold will be crossed for the second time at the
end of July. The last day of December will leave us with a new record -
$800.869.

January 2023 will begin with a price of $240.805. A downtrend will take
the figure down to $191.870 by October. December will bring Monero up to
$213.440. In 2024 the price will increase slowly but steadily. January
will begin with $224.114, July will show us $282.468, September is going
to be positive, crossing the $300 threshold, and December will leave us
with $325.98.

The year 2023 will begin with $369. The price will almost double during
the first half of the year and reach $617 by the end of June. The $700
threshold will be crossed in July, but after that, a downtrend will take
the price to $498 at the end of December.

2023 will bring growth to Monero. The price is expected to be $302 in
the middle of the year and $356 in the end. It will continue this trend,
and in the middle of 2024, it will reach $378, and the end of 2024 will
see it at $427.

## Long-Term Monero Price Forecast 2025-2030

Many different predictions have been made for the Monero price. How high
can Monero go? How much will it go up in value? In particular, the
growing problems surrounding the privacy of internet users are a big
plus for the project. Many people are starting to value their personal
data more and more, and all financial data is, of course, also part of
this. So, if you’re asking the question: “should I invest in Monero?”
Keep reading.

With Monero (XMR), it is therefore very interesting to save your money
since it is not accessible to everyone, even on the [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/).

Monero’s future value is hard to predict for the next ten years or more.
No expert is ready to give a precise projected value for any currency
over such a long period. Please note that such a long-term price
prediction and Monero price forecast is very approximate and is merely
speculation.

Wallet Investor experts can only estimate Monero projected growth until
September 2026. The year will begin at $950. After a few insignificant
ups and downs, stable growth will come in the middle of February and
take the price to $973 at the beginning of March. The $1,000 level will
be crossed at the end of April. XMR won’t stay for a long time and will
drop to $985 at the end of June. Another $1,000 peak will be reached in
August, but at this time, the price will go down again, too. Luckily, it
will only happen for a few days. The end of September will bring us
$1,034.

The experts are really generous and give Monero the price of $1,587.39
for the beginning of 2025. It will reach a $2,000 level and rise to
$2,017.87 in May. December 2025 will leave us with another record -
$3,094.07. January 2030 will take the price even higher - to $5,380.99.
It will continue growing through 2030 and reach $6,188.13 in July. The
closing price for December 2030 will be $6,726.23.

The average price for 2025 will be $1,206.57. It shows good stable
growth, and it is expected to double by 2027 and reach $2,622.13. The
year 2030 will bring us $8,279.97.

2025 will start with the price of $427. It will grow till the middle of
2027 and reach $663. The price seems to drop to $631 by the end of the
year. However, it will go up again and reach $821 by the middle of 2030.
Unfortunately, it is going to drop to $742 by the end of 2030.

## What Is the Future of Monero? Is XMR a Good Investment?

Many [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are concerned that they have entered too late. "With such
a high rate, I will never make more profits." However, this is not
always the case. Let's see if now is a good time to get into Monero.
Monero has gained a big name in the crypto world in recent years. They
are number 1 when it comes to the privacy and security of users. This
added to the Monero growth and Monero supply.

This is a very interesting fact because privacy is becoming an
increasingly important topic. More and more traders are starting to see
the benefits of this coin, and the outlook is therefore also bright.
Especially if you consider the [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/)ly highest price ever - it has
not yet been reached again, and that proves that there is still a lot of
growth in this crypto. [Monero ][10]has a good price target, as it also
moves strongly with Bitcoin.

About Bitcoin, experts say it will rise for a while. Some say it[ will
rise to $100,000 in the coming years][11]. This means that Monero will
rise also.

Monero has proven itself over the years as a major player in the crypto
market. It is still a very interesting cryptocurrency, despite the
extreme gains in 2020 and 2021. Monero - buy or sell: this is the real
question. The price still has many growth opportunities, which can be
seen in the 2025-2030 predictions.

Because the coin considers the privacy of its users of paramount
importance, it has an advantage over other coins. This is what makes
this coin special. Especially with the high supply of alternative
currencies, this distinctive character is very important.

If you want to start trading Monero, do it with a reputable
exchange/broker. The broker must at least have an internal wallet in
which you must be able to store your coins. A good example of this is
LiteForex. A great reason to create a free demo account on LiteForex!
LiteForex has fact-checked information and a user-friendly platform for
novices, as well as experienced traders.
