NEO Predictions: A Worthwhile Investment?Jana Kane

NEO is a popular [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) project that currently ranks 53rd out of all
cryptocurrencies on [Coinmarketcap][1], making it one of the most
popular altcoins. In this article, we’ll take a closer look at the
short- and long-term NEO price predictions and, in particular, the
predictions for the future. But we’ll also discuss the current NEO coin
rate and the [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) data of the coin.

The article covers the following subjects:

Everyone naturally wants to know what the NEO price will be in the
future. There are many NEO price predictions on the Internet, but which
one should you take seriously? It is best to make your own judgment
about the potential of NEO. You do not have to follow all predictions
indiscriminately. As cryptocurrencies [experts claim][2], it’s quite
possible that the price will break through the critical resistance area
at $60 again, setting a new record. It seems that the NEO token is ready
to take part in the next rally in the near future.

On this page, you will find the necessary facts that you can use to
answer the question for yourself: "Is NEO a worthwhile investment?"

## What Is NEO?

NEO, in short, is a [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) project from China founded in 2014. It
used to be called Antshares, but this changed later. [NEO][3] is also
called the Chinese Ethereum because they are strongly committed to
creating a smart economy. This means that the developers of the project
want to make it easy to use [smart contract](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/smart-contract-on-blockchain/)s on the NEO network.

For a trader to use the NEO network, a second cryptocurrency is used -
namely, GAS. This can be considered the fuel of NEO. One share of NEO is
also seen as one share in the network, and the GAS cryptocurrency is
used to make transactions on this network.

By saving your NEO in official wallets, it is possible to earn GAS with
your NEO. This is due to the proof of stake principle. You simply
deposit your NEO coins in your wallet and receive a portion of the GAS
spent on the network in proportion to the amount of NEO you own. It is
thus possible to generate some kind of passive income for yourself. You
can imagine that when the NEO price or the GAS price rises, you will
benefit from the price difference on your NEO but also that of your
obtained extra GAS.

This is one of the reasons people invest or have invested a lot in NEO
in the past. Over the years, as with any project, a lot has happened
with the NEO trend. We should add that it’s not possible to mine NEO
coins because they were all distributed during the ICO.

## NEO in 2020 and 2021: Some History

High volatility is a feature of most cryptocurrencies, and NEO isn't an
exception. Some [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) data will help you build NEO projected
values.

In 2020, NEO was below $10 at the beginning of the year and touched the
lowest point of the year of $4 on March 13 (at Bitfinex exchange). Yet,
the NEO value managed to jump to $25.90 by September 18. At the end of
the year, the NEO/USD pair settled near $14.

It's well-known that small cryptos copy movements of BTC/USD. Thus, most
of the ups and downs of the NEO/USD pair just repeated Bitcoin's trends.
For instance, the coronavirus hit financial markets in March 2020 the
most, resulting in downtrends in the crypto world, pushing Bitcoin and
NEO down.

Still, some events caused divergence in the direction of prices. At the
end of July, NEO partnered with the Blockchain-based Services Network.
BSN is a global infrastructure that offers a cheap platform for
[blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) projects and similar companies, creating a digital economy.
This event pushed the NEO rate up. You can see how NEO coin [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) can
affect the price of the cryptocurrency.

NEO coin has experienced wild [volatility spikes in 2021][2]. The year
started at the price of $14.25. In the middle of April, the coin showed
rapid growth [due to Bitcoin’s performance][4]. Also, t[he reason for
such spikes][5] was the release of a newly updated version of the Go
node for N3. The main difference from the previous version is that the
tracking code now diverts from the implementation in the core C# client.
The update has corrected a potential deadlock in nodes that have the
optional notary service enabled. Moreover, wallet files are cleaned up
properly after keys are removed. Chinese crypto [regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/) affects the
NEO price, too. On April 19, in the early Asian session, NEO skyrocketed
as the People’s Bank of China called cryptocurrencies “investment
tools.” The country was going to issue new [regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/)s, as stablecoins
were turning into payment solutions.

This bullish trend continued to May 7. The cryptocurrency hit a new
year-to-date high of $140.77 on May 7, 2021, and fell to $25.03 by July
20, 2021 (Bitfinex exchange). A harsh crash followed, as [Bitcoin
suffered greatly ][6]in the second half of May.

The price gradually increased from $25.03 on July 20 to its recent high
of $62.97 on August 24, growing by over 151% within a month.

At the beginning of September, the price went up and crossed the $60
mark. However, it didn’t manage to stay this way, and the price
correction began.

The last NEO all-time high price was [196.85][7] USD on January 15,
2018, it is much higher than in 2020. A strong bullish trend that began
after the June 2017 rebranding pushed NEO price to its all-time high.
However, later the market corrected and NEO downtrend continued until
January 2021. The NEO/USD today’s rate is: $49.28

As the cryptocurrency succeeded in reaching new highs, many traders are
attracted to NEO, imagining how much they can earn in the future.

### NEO 3.0 Release and How It Can Affect NEO's Price

The NEO team was working on the project for three years. The Crypto
world has been waiting for the NEO 3.0 release since the end of 2020.
The launch was postponed several times. However, in March 2021, Neo
started rolling out an N3 version of its public [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/)
infrastructure.

NEO 3.0 Preview. NEO tries to attract developers to create decentralized
applications on the [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/). The improved consensus protocol can be
used worldwide. The upgrade of the system occurs when the Ethereum
network (a major competitor of NEO) is suffering capacity problems.
Moreover, China, famous for its strict crypto [regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/), claimed
[blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) as a strategically leading technology.

The key points of the N3:

  * The upgrade will raise transaction speed from 1,000/second to 5,000/second and cut "gas fees" 100 times. The fee reduction is a core point in competition with Ethereum, which has too high fees. 

  * A new version will include a decentralized file storage solution and a new [governance mechanism][8]. Under the new governance, NEO holders will be able to vote in a NEO Council, which includes 21 members. The Council will control the management of fees, network upgrades, and other operation-based cases.

  * N3 can become a good place to create non-fungible tokens.



[Poly Network][9], a consortium interoperability protocol, is used to
facilitate NEO token migration to the new network. The migration with
Poly Network will show whether the network works well to create a
[blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) from scratch and transfer all the data from the existing
chain without errors.

Here are some of the major elements of the NEO 3.0 network that are
supposed to attract developers to the system: multi-language support,
native oracles that secure access to any off-chain data, advanced
interoperability, decentralized storage, and self-sovereign identity,
best-in-class tooling, and a dual-token model.

In the middle of April 2021, after NEO 3.0 started rolling out, the
NEO/USD pair managed to hit $130. It's a significant rise from 0.0320
USD during the ICO in August 2017. The final release was on August 2,
2021.

## NEO Price Prediction for the Rest of 2021 by Crypto Experts

NEO, thanks to its great potential, is a better long-term investment
than many other cryptocurrencies. A release of N3 is a springboard for
the NEO price. Let's get a foretaste of the NEO future value by looking
at the predictions given by famous crypto traders and reputable
publications.

Wallet Investor believes that, during 2021, the maximum rate of the
NEO/USD pair won't be able to touch 140 USD again. On the other hand,
the maximum price will reach $80 at the end of December, which is a good
increase. The NEO price on the 31 of December will be $84.710 US
dollars.

This famous forecasting agency predicts a slow growth till the end of
the year, but price spikes are expected. The last days of October will
bring the highest price that will break $50. A rise to $60 is expected
in December.

CryptoGround platform forecasts the NEO will experience an uptrend,
although it won't be significant. At the end of the year, the NEO coin
may rise to $71.56.

The [website](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/website-for-forex-trading/) sees NEO targeting a new peak shortly. Experts believe that
the cryptocurrency has gone through the worst.

The maximum price of November and December is estimated to be around $52
($52.680 in November and $52.875 in December). However, the average
price in December will be only $42.300.

CoinPriceForecast [website](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/website-for-forex-trading/) has predicted a sideways moment. By the end of
2021, the price may reach $46.68.

## NEO Technical Analysis

Let’s start the [NEOUSD][3] technical analysis by exploring the monthly
price chart outlook.

This year from May to April, the NEO price reached its peak. After the
NEO price sharp rise, now a downward price movement is developing
similar to 2018. Decline is accompanied with high volumes, which
suggests sellers are interested in reducing NEO price.

Considering the [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) case in 2018, when after the strongest growth
the price returned to its base, now the projected NEO decline can rush
to its [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) low around 4 USD (marked with a red line).

### NEO price prediction for three months

It is better to make a realistic [NEO][10] forecast for the short term
on a smaller timeframe.

The weekly chart shows the current market situation much better. We can
observe that the developing bearish trend has high potential because it
is accompanied by an increase of sellers’ activity.

Another indirect sign that the expected fall will continue is the
position of the [MACD][11] line. In May, it crossed the signal curve
from top to bottom, thereby confirming the end of the previous bullish
trend. At the moment, the indicator histogram remains in the red zone
and there are no signs of a trend reversal.

Most likely, the future price will continue to decline. However, the
intensity of the decline will decrease. There is now a break of the
trend line and a continuation of the decline at a less acute angle.

A similar market pattern of price movement has already occurred in 2018.
In the next three months, there is no reason for any other development.
The expected NEO trading range is from 39 USD to 4 USD.

### Long-term NEO forecast for 2021

Let’s conduct a technical analysis of the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) timeframe and make a
forecast for 2021.

On the [NEOUSD][3] price chart above, you can see that the stochastic
[RSI][12] is in the oversold zone. Without confirming signals from the
MACD and candlestick patterns on higher timeframes, this signal is weak
and, at best, can indicate a decline slowdown and possible consolidation
for a short time.

Thus, after analyzing the [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) of prices using [Bollinger bands][13]
and following the decline continuation, let’s project trading ranges for
each month. As you can see, the NEO price chart will smoothly approach
the support level of around 4 USD for most of the specified period.

When this level is reached, the price will most likely rebound and
continue to move within a wide channel with a high around $40. Most
likely, like three years ago, after sharp surges, the market will go
into a protracted consolidation.

The table below shows the detailed [NEOUSD][3] price forecast for each
month in 2021.

#### Long-term NEO trading plan

Let's assess the potential of the NEO and make up an optimal
cryptocurrency trading plan.

Obviously, having such a bearish scenario, it is necessary to consider
short sell trades where the target is the support level 4 USD. It is
difficult to predict how close the market will get to it, so I would
focus on the level of 10 USD (the green line on the chart).

There are two levels for entering a short trade. The first order can be
placed at the breakout of the local low around 26 USD  (blue line).

The last high of 39 USD (red line) can be used as a guideline for the
stop loss. I would exit a trade with a loss after overcoming the 40 USD
mark.

I would enter another short trade near the stop around 37 USD. This
approach will allow you to average the position and break even if the
market gets stuck in a narrow range. Be sure to consider the risks and
do not risk more than 1% of the portfolio for the entire trade.

Hypov][14]._

## Weekly Elliott wave NEO analysis as of 08.11.2021

The NEOUSD market is forming the middle part of the global double zigzag
(W)-(X)-(Y). That is, the bearish linking wave (X) is unfolding as a
double zigzag W-X-Y, which is about to end soon, as the final motive
sub-wave Y has started developing inside. Sub-wave W is a triple zigzag
[W]-[X]-[Y]-[X]-[Z]; the X wave is a regular zigzag [A]-[B]-[C]. The Y
wave could be a double zigzag [W]-[X]-[Y], as outlined in the chart. Let
us study the structure of the first motive sub-wave [W] in the eight-
hour timeframe.

The first two sub-waves, impulse down wave (A) and corrective upwave
(B), which is a simple zigzag A-B-C, have completed within the down wave
[W]. There is forming the initial part of the final sub-wave (C), which
could be an impulse 1-2-3-4-5, as outlined in the chart. The first sub-
wave 1 of a smaller degree seems to have completed. The price will
continue rising in impulse sub-wave [C] of a smaller degree, which will
conclude correction 2 at a level of around 54.00.

## NEO Price Prediction for 2022 by Crypto Experts

2022 is close. Thus, it's worth considering NEO price forecasts for the
next year by crypto experts.

During the first two months of the year, the NEO/USD rate may jump to
$84.16. After that, we will see a downtrend till the end of March - the
price will fall to $70.77. The rate will rocket to $98.01 in May and
will then fall again and remain between $74-$75 in July. A slight
uptrend is expected next, which will take the price to $79.83 in the
middle of August. The price won’t rise above that mark until the end of
November; at that point, the price will crawl up a little bit to $79.99.
The last day of December will show us the NEO price of $93.51.

According to the Economy Forecast Agency’s [website](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/website-for-forex-trading/), NEO’s price will
fluctuate within the $38.66-$65.26 range. With the series of ups and
downs, the price will reach $48.50 by the beginning of July. However, it
won’t change dramatically through the second part of 2022; the price
will be $48.66 at the end of December.

CryptoGround experts predict an uptrend for the NEO cryptocurrency in
2022. By the end of the year, the NEO/USD exchange rate may reach
$93.47.

TradingBeasts provides one of the most pessimistic forecasts for NEO.
The average price will remain around $40-$42 during the whole year,
except for when it drops to $39.43 in December.

DigitalCoin, like most of the other forecast platforms, believes in the
upward movement of the NEO/USD price. During the year, the average price
won't move below $80.

Coin Price Forecast expects the exchange rate to jump to $66.63 by July
2022. The experts predict a further uptrend that will take the price to
$77.02.

## Long-Term NEO Price Prediction for 2025-2030 by Crypto Experts

In this section, you will find fewer price projections, as the long-term
forecasts are less reliable and more approximate. Many factors affect
the cryptocurrency rate. That's why it's so hard to build accurate
predictions.

DigitalCoin [website](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/website-for-forex-trading/) is optimistic about the long-term price direction.
The average price will start the considering period at $132.15, coming
to 2028 at $203.21. However, the platform doesn't provide projections
for 2029 and 2030.

The Economy Forecast Agency can submit only a partial forecast for 2025,
and it is not a pleasant one for NEO fans. The year 2025 will start with
$34.78, and it is the highest price in all of 2025. With insignificant
ups and downs, the price will arrive at $21.22 at the end of June and
will be 25.44 USD at the end of November.

According to the CryptoGround [website](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/website-for-forex-trading/), the price will keep rising.
Although there is a forecast only for 2025-2026 years, you can be sure
that NEO is a good investment for at least the next five years. In 2025,
the average price will stay at $193; in 2026, it will move up to
$208.47.

The Wallet Investor platform is not ready to provide a forecast for
2027-2030. Still, it has some projections for you. By the end of 2025,
the price may overcome $188.79.

The forecasts for 2026 finish in May. Still, based on this information,
we can say the uptrend will continue. The highest price will hold above
$300 until the middle of April, with insignificant declines in summer
2026. The lowest price won't decline below $95.85. Again a big price
difference is a signal of big market fluctuations.

Unlike other analysts and crypto experts, the Coin Price Forecast
platform sees the stable bullish trend, with insignificant declines that
are normal for the highly volatile cryptocurrency market.

## How Did the Price of NEO Change Over Time?

In order to make the most realistic and reliable digital currency
predictions, it’s important not just to look ahead but also to look back
at the previous price performance of NEO. Below you can see how the NEO
price changed from 2017 to 2020:

 _Source: Coinmarketcap_

## Is NEO a Good Investment?

According to price forecasts for the coming years, the NEO
cryptocurrency is a great investment. Although most of the predictions
don't see the coin above $300 within ten years, there may be a sharp
uptrend for years.

### GAS Dividend From Your NEO

The more NEO you own, the more GAS you will receive. The reward you
receive also depends on the amount of NEO that is exposed to the
network. "Low" NEO prices mean you can buy more of it, and more NEO =
more GAS.

5 GAS tokens are created every block and shared between three parts. 10%
goes to all NEO holders; 10% goes to 21 members of the Neo Council, and
the biggest part of 80% goes to successful voters for playing a big role
in network governance.

0.00000001 is the minimum unit of GAS. To claim GAS tokens, you are not
required to stake NEO. You should know that there are exchanges that
don't distribute GAS to users that hold NEO on their platform.

Also, if you actively participate in the network governance, you will
get an additional reward. Be sure a wallet you choose supports voting.

Let's imagine you invested $10,000 to buy 90 NEO. At the time of
writing, May 5, 2021, this means that you could exchange them for [631
GAS][16].

A user with 90 NEO would receive up to [0.08 GAS per month for holding
NEO plus 3.15 GAS per month][17] for governance participation. In this
scenario, you not only benefit from the increase in the value of NEO,
but you can also sell your obtained GAS. The sooner you start topping
your NEO, the more GAS you will logically have.

The prices are relatively low compared to the [all-time][18] high
($97.49 on January 15, 2018). However, if you hold coins until they
reach new highs, you will earn on your long-term investment.

No one saw it coming when NEO's massive price rose to well over $190. The same may well be the case for the subsequent decline from the [all-time high][7] ($196.85 on January 15, 2018). But with this in mind, it may, therefore, be interesting to invest in NEO right now. Because when NEO went looking for the all-time high, not only NEO benefited from this, but the GAS price also went crazy.

## Conclusion

Based on the averages of [algorithms](https://www.fintechee.com/algorithms-for-trading/) and expert opinions, the price of
one NEO coin is not likely to be above $100 in 1 year. However, stable
growth is predicted for the future. This makes NEO a worthwhile long-
term investment. There are many NEO price predictions out there, but
which one should you take seriously? It is best to make your own
projection about the potential of NEO. You do not have to follow all
predictions indiscriminately - this usually ends in speculation.
