Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 08.11.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

The short-term oil trend reversed up.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

The short-term oil trend reversed up. The Intermediary Zone 80.40 -
80.14 was broken out today. Now the resistance level of 81.95 serves as
the target for purchases. The second target for purchases is the upper
Target Zone 83.20 - 82.69.

It is profitable to look for oil purchases on correction at strong
support levels. The Additional Zone 80.30 - 80.18 and the Intermediary
Zone 79.03 - 78.77 serve as strong support levels. The IZ is the border
of a new short-term uptrend.

So, to enter oil sales, sellers need to break out the trend border and
consolidate the price below.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

Buy in the zone of 80.30 - 78.77. TakeProfit: 81.95. StopLoss: 78.29.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

Gold price is trying to break out the Gold Zone 1816 - 1815. If traders
manage to consolidate the price above this zone, the next target within
the short-term uptrend will be Target Zone 2 1837 - 1833. Today, look
for new gold purchases at strong supports. The Additional Zone 1812 -
1811 serves as the first strong support.

If the Additional Zone is broken out downside, it will be possible to
work in correction with the target in the Intermediary Zone 1802 - 1800.
When the IZ is reached, look for purchases according to the pattern,
with the first target around ​​today's high.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

  1. Buy according to the pattern in Additional Zone 1812 - 1811. TakeProfit: 1821. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

The short-term euro downtrend continued last week. As a result, the
lower Target Zone 1.1516 - 1.1498 was reached on Friday. After that,
large sales were closed, and the price rolled back up.

The price rise that started on Friday is a corrective growth. As part of
this growth, the Additional Zone 1.1561 - 1.1557 was reached. While the
AZ is held, look for new euro sales with a target at Friday's low. If
the AZ is broken out, then expect the price in the Intermediary Zone
1.1610 - 1.1601.

The Intermediary Zone serves as the border of a short-term downtrend. It
would also be reasonable to look for sales in the beforementioned IZ
according to the pattern with the same target at the level of 1.1514.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

  1. Sell according to the pattern in Additional Zone 1.1516 - 1.1557. TakeProfit: 1.1514. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.
