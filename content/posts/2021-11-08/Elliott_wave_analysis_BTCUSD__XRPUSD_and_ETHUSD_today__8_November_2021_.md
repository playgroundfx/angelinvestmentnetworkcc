Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 08.11.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

The cryptocurrency pairs covered in the article should rise a little in
the near future and start declining after that.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

The BTCUSD market is forming the upward impulse wave, with horizontal
correction 4 unfolding inside as a double three [W]-[X]-[Y]. So far, the
down motive wave [W] has completed as a double zigzag. There is now
unfolding the final part of the linking wave [X], which is a triple
zigzag. The above-indicated wave should end at a level of around
67070.00, marked by impulse wave 3.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 65346.00, TP 67070.00

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

The XRPUSD market is forming a large linking wave (X). The final sub-
wave of the linking wave (X) is developing as a double zigzag
[W]-[X]-[Y]. Let us explore the final sub-wave [Y] unfolding as an
ascending double zigzag (W)-(X)-(Y). The motive wave (Y) is composed of
sub-waves A-B-C, as outlined in the chart. The price should stop rising
in the indicated wave at a level of 1.380.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] **** today:

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

The ETHUSD market is forming an impulse upwave, namely, its middle part.
There is forming the upward impulse wave 3 composed of sub-waves
[1]-[2]-[3]-[4]-[5]. Wave 3 should soon finish. The market must be
rising in sub-wave [5] towards a level of 4930.00. Next, after wave 3
completes, the market should turn down and start declining in corrective
wave 4, as outlined in the chart.
