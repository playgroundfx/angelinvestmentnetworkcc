Litecoin Price Predictions: How It could go in 2021 and BeyondJana Kane

Litecoin cryptocurrency was up by more than 140% in 2020. In 2021, LTC
showed very fast growth till May; however, due to some external factors,
the situation significantly changed. The Litecoin price has been through
a lot from its launch – going up and down. Its price started at about $3
per LTC and has gone through a number of bubble cycles or "alt seasons."

Eventually, Litecoin closed 2020 at $124.69 (on CoinMarketCap). From
December 31st, 2020, to May 9th of this year, the price rose by 211%.
After it hit the $400 level, the coin started dropping. From the period
between May 10th and 23rd, it declined by 63.26%. Similar to other
cryptocurrencies, one of the big reasons for such a fall is the overall
weakness of Bitcoin. In general, similar and close currencies have tight
correlations. It could have been seen that due to the fast growth of the
LTC, the coin would have declines. Lastly, the concerns in the United
States for higher capital gains taxes played a role in the financial
industry.

As for the long-term Litecoin prediction, the outlook suggests that
Litecoin has potential. Will the price of Litecoin go up this year and
in the years to come? Let's find out!

The article covers the following subjects:

## A Bit of Litecoin History

Litecoin ([LTC][1]) is a so-called digital peer-to-peer currency
integrated into open-source software. Technically, the Litecoin project
is very similar to the Bitcoin system. Litecoin production and
transmission are based on an open-source encryption protocol. There is
no central control. With this in mind, all transactions, balances, and
expenses are managed by a peer-to-peer network. Litecoin is created on
the basis of a cryptological hash function, which in turn generates
blocks. Litecoin can be exchanged for Bitcoin and fiat money. The
processing in question usually takes place via online exchanges
([cryptocurrency exchange](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/best-cryptocurrency-exchange/)s).

Litecoin was created by a former Google employee, Charlie Lee, in 2011.
The cryptocurrency was created based on the Bitcoin protocol but differs
in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of the hash algorithm used. Furthermore, it also differs in
hard caps, block transaction times, and some other factors. Litecoin was
released via an open-source client on GitHub on October 7, 2011. On
October 13, 2011, 5 days later, the Litecoin network went live.

Lee's goal was to create a light version of Bitcoin with Litecoin.
Developers have always stated that you can consider Litecoin to be the
silver version of Bitcoin. Litecoin differs from Bitcoin in the
prioritization of the transaction confirmation rate, which is
approximately 2.5 minutes per block. However, the reality is that
Litecoin users will have to wait up to about 30 minutes for their
transaction to be processed due to network congestion.

## Why Is Litecoin an Attractive Investment Asset?

Litecoin is especially faster at handling payments than Bitcoin and is
an excellent, proven complementary alternative. It's a very cheap,
super-safe highway for making payments - especially when it comes to
micro-transactions, like, for example, when paying for a cup of coffee.
In addition, the Litecoin community is working on the implementation of
all kinds of new fintech gadgets that are actually intended for Bitcoin.
Litecoin is now working on the implementation of the lightning network
protocol and applications for [smart contract](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/smart-contract-on-blockchain/)s and privacy (including
confidential transactions & MimbleWimble). Litecoin is certainly light
and cheap, but above all in good hands with fantastic ambitions.
Litecoin has a bright future as a classic and reliable altcoin.

Most [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s see Bitcoin as gold and Litecoin as silver. Litecoin was
developed as an alternative to Bitcoin and developed as a lightweight
that solved some shortcomings of Bitcoin. It is a classic altcoin with
more than 6 years of experience and development behind it. Software
updates and new tech can be easily added to Litecoin.

As with Bitcoin, there is also a built-in scarcity. In total, only 84
million Litecoin can be mined. Litecoin can be considered a much cheaper
and faster alternative. In fact, Litecoin is underestimated relative to
other cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is slower and more expensive to use
compared to Litecoin.

The fact that Litecoin is fast and cheap has advantages, especially
since people in third world countries without bank accounts can still
get Litecoin cheaply and quickly.

### Why is Litecoin going up?

Litecoin is a superior alternative to fiat money when compared to
Ethereum. Ethereum was not developed as money, but it can certainly be
used as such. You could rather consider Ethereum to be crypto gas.

In addition, Ethereum is a much more difficult concept to grasp than
Litecoin. Litecoin is just digital p2p money with a built-in scarcity
that actually works faster as a transaction medium. This makes adoption
much easier and does not require much knowledge. Simply install the
wallet app on your smartphone, and you will have your own Swiss Litecoin
bank account with which you can actually conduct transactions almost
immediately. As the popularity and price of Bitcoin increase and,
therefore, the transaction costs rise, cheaper and faster alternatives
will be sought. This is Litecoin, baby.

## Other Interesting Facts

Litecoin has made a lot of progress and has even been included as a
means of payment in Venezuela's mainstream international payments
system. Via the Remesas remittance platform, foreigners can send
Litecoin to family members and friends in Venezuela who receive Bolivars
in their local bank account through Remesas. A commission of 15% is
charged, which means that the government in Venezuela secretly collects
Litecoin.

Another interesting fact is that the Litecoin Foundation has a 9.9%
share in the German WEG bank. The Litecoin Foundation has received this
as a donation from the Swiss [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) company TokenPay. Together they
have almost a 20% share in this conservative German bank, mainly for
real estate [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s. Litecoin can thus be recognized in the long-term
as a possible cryptocurrency for buying real estate in Germany? But we
digress, so let's not dive too deep into the matter, look at the price
[history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/), and see how the coin develops.

## Litecoin Price Analysis

Despite it not being a bullish period for cryptocurrencies until around
October 2020, Litecoin has performed reasonably well compared to its
competitors. Charlie Lee is clearly doing really well; he finally
introduced confidential transactions (CT). Like the privacy coins ZCash
and Monero, LTC’s confidential transactions will prevent replaceability,
scalability, and privacy issues.

The acceptance rate is also quite high. Very recently, the Litecoin logo
was even advertised on the UFC mat during a famous fight. It was a real
eye-catcher. Furthermore, a new shopping center in Singapore with an ATM
that accepts both Bitcoin and Litecoin has been installed. LTC price
prediction is very optimistic in the opinion of experts.

Experts expect the Litecoin future to be bright in 2021 due to all
integrations and partnerships. In addition, the Litecoin community is
very active, with all the upcoming developments. They will, of course,
keep the enthusiasts informed. There is a clear potential that Litecoin
will rise further and is certainly a tough competitor for the other
cryptos.

However, LTC’s price will most probably stay below $300 and is less
likely to hit its all-time high, $412.96, which was set on May 10, 2021.
What will Litecoin do in the next 5 years?



## Litecoin Price Predictions for 2021 by Crypto Experts

The cryptocurrency market is very volatile, which means that predicting
reliable prices of cryptocurrencies is indeed one of the most difficult
things to do. George Tung, one of the most respected cryptocurrency
analysts, bet on LTC for almost 3 years already. Although his forecast
for 2021 was far too overestimated ($1,500 by the end of 2021), Tung
still sees potential for Litecoin to grow. Another famous expert, Dan
Gambardello, predicted a meteoric rise of LTC in 2017 and now forecasts
future growth of LTC in 2021 up to $1,000. Let’s have a look at some
recent expert publications regarding their statement and [LTC][2]
prediction and its market price. They may give us food for thought about
Litecoin coin review:

TradingBeats estimates some small declines in July, where the maximum
value can reach up to $151.73 with a minimum of $103.17. However,
according to its analysis, from July, the LTC will show some small but
positive rises each month. By December of 2021, it will have a possible
maximum value of around $160 with an average of $128. Overall, the
platform forecasts Litecoin’s projection growth.

Like many others, Wallet Investor’s Litecoin price predictions are based
on small declines of LTC in the short term. The coin is expected to have
an average value of $143.25 at the beginning of  July, with a maximum
price of $202.15.  Litecoin will definitely show a long-term positive
balance starting from September. Despite the small dynamics right now,
Wallet Investor predicts that Litecoin has the potential to grow up to
$182 in the second half of this year. According to the analysis of WI,
until November 2021, the price will be relatively stable (an average of
$132). There are no future big crashes to expect, and [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s do have
to consider this currency for investment.

Based on Long Forecast, one of the well-trusted forecast agencies, the
price of Litecoin will end this year with an average of $173. The
negative tendency under the high volatility of the prices will most
probably be kept for the next couple of months. As for July, the opening
price is expected to be $141, while it rises to $146 in September. EFA
sees the potential in this cryptocurrency and, in the long run, predicts
much higher returns. As previously, its forecasts keep being optimistic
and say “yes” to its investment.  Below, the table shows how much it can
vary:

Coin Price Forecast sees Litecoin’s growth to $203 by the end of 2021.
Similar to other agencies, it sees the climb of the currency starting
from September; however, Coin Price Forecast has much higher predictions
than other similar platforms. As a result, this projected growth is
still a bit too optimistic; however, it is possible to be true, as
Litecoin has dropped more due to external factors.

## Litecoin Technical Analysis

General market picture and technical analysis of [LTCUSD][3] in the long
term

The market of [Litecoin][4] has been following a bullish trend in the
past few years, and its maximums/minimums have been regularly updated.
At the same time, any fast upsurge was followed by as fast a fall.

Generally speaking, the current upsurge seems to repeat the previous
spikes in Litecoin prices. So, be ready for a further fast bearish
movement during which the LTC price chart may come close to the blue
trend line.

### LTC price prediction for next three months

Technical analysis of the weekly chart. Short-term Litecoin forecast for
the next three months.

[MACD][5] readings are quite interesting here. Upon a trend reversal in
May, the signal line crossed the MACD curve from above and the
indicator’s chart then moved to the negative zone.

The MACD line is currently located a little below zero, but far from the
support level formed on the previous big movement to the downside. Thus
we can conclude that Litecoin’s future price may fall further.

In general [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/), the weekly chart confirms that the current fractal is
similar to the 2018 movement. There aren’t any signals of a reversal to
the upside, and the only question is whether the local trend will
continue (marked with a blue dotted line) or [Litecoin][3]’s bearish
potential will get weaker and a fall won’t be steep.

### Monthly Litecoin price forecast for 2021/2022

To make a realistic forecast in the long term, let’s switch to LTC/USD
[daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) chart and analyze Litecoin’s price [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) using [Bollinger Bands](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/bollinger-bands.html).

The above signals indicate that the LTC future price will go on falling,
but slower than in the past few months. Most likely, it will have come
close to the trend line by the middle of autumn, LTC projected value
being 40-70 USD by that moment. False breakouts shouldn’t be excluded
either. Litecoin’s expected trading range will most likely remain the
same for the rest of the year as the market has consolidated for a long
time. However, LTC/USD price may attempt to grow at the beginning of
2022 and closer to summer, taking the price [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) into account.

The table below presents LTC projected values for 2021-2022.

#### Long-term trading plan for Litecoin

Based on the forecast, let’s outline the optimal trading plan for
LTC/USD.

As a bearish trend is very likely to continue, short positions seem to
be the best choice. The market’s obvious price target for the nearest
months is the global trend line.

I recommend opening trades once the Litecoin price chart consolidates
underneath the latest local minimum at about 105 USD (purple solid
line). Stop Loss should be placed at the latest local maximum of 146 US
dollars marked with a red line in the chart. Place Take Profit a bit
higher than the trend line, at 50 USD for example (green line).

The [LTCUSD][3] price technical analysis is presented by [Mikhail
Hypov][6].

[Here, you can find [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) Litecoin short-term forecasts][7] and trading
signals based on the Elliott wave analysis.

## Weekly Elliott wave Litecoin analysis as of 08.11.2021

The LTCUSD market has finished the global corrective trend, as clear
from the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) timeframe. In spring, there must have completed the
simple bullish zigzag composed of three large sub-waves A-B-C. Next, the
price started declining in the new bearish trend. There should be
forming the middle leg of the simple descending zigzag [A]-[B]-[C].
Impulse wave [A] has finished. The bullish correction [B] is still
developing. Let’s study the most recent chart section in the eight-hour
timeframe.

Corrective wave [B] is forming as a standard zigzag (A)-(B)-(C). Sub-
waves (A) and (B) have finished as a simple impulse and a simple zigzag.
The final wave (C) looks like a simple five-wave impulse, with the final
leg unfolding inside. The Litecoin price should be rising in sub-wave 5
to the previous high of 232.00, marked by the impulse wave (A). After
this level is reached, the price will start declining.

## Litecoin Price Prediction for 2022

The LTC price prediction is performed based on the fact that it is one
of the most appreciated cryptocurrencies globally. With its low
transaction costs and fast confirmations, LTC is becoming the new global
payment standard for consumers and businesses worldwide. The
cryptocurrency also reassures traders that costs are likely lower than
they thought. The processing fees are far less than those incurred by
credit cards and other forms of payments. Even the integration is free.

As Litecoin is steadily gaining more popularity, the acceptance ratio
might also increase. It is already high compared to the other newcomers.
Let's have a look at the predictions of crypto experts.

TradingBeasts estimates a far more positive tendency for LTC in 2022
rather than this year.  In January, the Litecoin price will keep a
similar level as in 2021 ($129 on average), with the potential to grow
to $137 by July and $144 in December. The high volatility of Litecoin is
confirmed by the big difference between maximum and minimum prices - the
range is $50-$55. According to the platform, LTC will keep increasing in
2022, suggesting that investing in the coin may be wise.

Wallet Investor also forecasts the rise of the currency in 2022. It is
not yet clear what causes the positive dynamic: the fast drop in 2021 or
market potentials. Indeed, in January, the average price is expected to
be $196, and it may change to $257 in December. Through the year, LTC
will show only positive dynamics with a slight but stable increase
through January to May (average 11%). Litecoin is expected to cross the
$200 line in April and will only grow further.

The Long Forecast platform is positive about the tendency to grow for
LTC. Similar to 2021, Litecoin will have its ups and downs. 2022 is
expected to start at $201. However, Litecoin is expected to hit $277 in
December 2022. The table below describes its monthly tendency in detail:

Coin Price Forecast predicts positive changes for Litecoin - according
to which, LTC will climb up to $264 in the first half of 2022 and to a
total of $323 in the second half.

Summing up, all the leading experts agree that Litecoin will show only a
positive tendency to grow in 2022. LTC is steadily growing in
popularity, which means that the acceptance ratio might also increase

## Litecoin Price Prediction for 2023

Litecoin price forecasts vary a lot. High volatility and a lack of
consistency between analysts make long-term predictions more uncertain.
Still, we can't avoid price predictions for 2023 as they may help long-
term [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s.

TradingBeasts’ prediction for Litecoin is positive. The source forecasts
the future rise of Litecoin. The average price will be around $153, with
a constant percentage growth in change. During the year, the price for
LTE will rise from $145 to $159.

January and February of 2023 are expected to have market fluctuations.
However, from March to May, lower price volatility is expected. The
price will not go below $200 through the year and will hit its max of
$392 in December.

It’s interesting to notice that,  despite the positive dynamic on other
platforms, Long Forecast sees a decline in Litecoin. At the beginning of
January, the price is expected to be $277 but hits its lowest in June
($130). Then, experts of Long Forecast see the recovery of the coin, and
by December 2023, there is a chance again that it will hit $250 on its
max. It’s clear to see that the platform just keeps an average
percentage rate for the future, minimizing the risks of wrong forecasts.

The Coin Price Forecast never changes its positive forecasts for
Litecoin. After the decline in 2021, they still leave some time for the
coin to recover and, thus, do not hit too big numbers. In 2023, the
average price for LTC is expected to be $293. Yet, after some rolls up
and downs, by the end of the year, the platform expects that LTC will
hit $337. The forecast seems quite realistic, despite some slight
overestimations in calculations.

## Long-Term Litecoin Price Prediction: 2025-2030

The third halving for Litecoin is set to take place in May 2023. In
doing so, block rewards would be halved to 6.25 LTC. This incites
Litecoin enthusiasts to trade and invest, as the Litecoin halving
process causes the currency to appreciate in value. Litecoin could even
excel above its competitors to become one of the most traded
cryptocurrencies. As of now, the rewards per block are [12.5 coins][10]
and will decrease to 6.25 coins per block post halving.

What could Litecoin be worth in 10 years? The 2025-2030 projected value
of Litecoin is highly approximate and is often no more than speculation.
Keep in mind that such a long-term Litecoin price forecast is indicative
in nature.

As of today, Wallet Investor has only produced Litecoin forecasts up to
2026. Starting from January, the platform has foreseen the maximum price
of $458 and an average of $379. Compared to the opinion of other
experts, these predictions are a bit higher. However, if LTC will have
some upgrades in the future, the situation can be changed a lot. By the
end of June 2026, LTC will reach its max of $570. For two years, some
drops are yet to be seen, but on average, Litecoin will only grow
further

Similar to the Wallet Investor platform, the Long Forecast platform did
not predict far from today. Currently, the forecast is only available up
to mid-2025. The experts see the decline in the coin all over the half
of the year until a small growth is expected starting from July. The
forecasts were probably made based on the current decline of the coin,
so it is too early to say how accurate they can be. Yet, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s
should consider negative outcomes and declines just as much as positive
waves.

According to the Coin Price Forecast, a Litecoin price target for the
middle of 2025 is $345. By the end of 2030, Litecoin will reach $509.
The platform sees only positive dynamics in the future for LTC.

## How Has the Price of Litecoin Changed Over Time?

The Litecoin price today is  $224.40. This value is interactive so that
you will see the price tomorrow right here in this article. Due to the
fast declines this year, CoinMarketCap ranks Litecoin at the #13
position, which is 3 positions lower than before, with a market cap of
$8,820,885,973 (June 27, 2021). The circulating Litecoin supply is
66,752,415 LTC, while the maximum supply is 84,000,000 LTC coins.

The Litecoin price hit its all-time high of $412.96 on May 10, 2021. But
to make the most reliable cryptocurrency predictions, it's important not
just to look ahead but also to look back at the [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) price
performance of Litecoin. From 2011 to 2013, LTC increased from a few
cents to $3. In 2013, it experienced its first bull market, which helped
the coin to reach the price of $50. Later in 2014, due to the Mt. Gox
exchange scandal and bear market, the price went back as low as $3.

Litecoin stayed low until it rose at the end of March 2017 from $3 to
$80 in September 2017. Its absolute record in 2017 was set at around 375
dollars on December 19th. However, in the same month, Litecoin quickly
dropped after its creator, Charlie Lee, announced on his Twitter that he
sold his Litecoin due to a conflict of interest.

In 2018, it experienced another downtrend throughout the year and
reached $25 in December 2018. The decline was caused by the bearish
trend of Bitcoin. As you may remember, Litecoin is mostly affected by
BTC’s direction rather than private factors.

In February 2019, LTC started in a bull market and rose to $140 in June.
However, the rise didn’t last for long. In the second half of 2019, the
price dropped to $40. Again, the decline was triggered by the overall
fall of the cryptocurrency market.

In 2020, Litecoin plunged due to the sudden pandemic of Covid-19 between
February and March. Since then, the market was stable, moving sideways.
Through the whole [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) of the LTC, it has constantly experienced its
ups and downs each year.

Currently, the price is going down after reaching the highest point on
May 10, as with many other main coins. The current Litecoin price might
go down in the future. However, it’s probably all about the price
correction. The new heights are going to appear. Below you'll see how
Litecoin performed over the years of its existence:



## Is Litecoin a Good Investment?

Litecoin, buy or sell? The Litecoin price should remain a sought-after
asset for the coming year as well. Despite the down sizes and high
volatility, many experts suggest investing in LTC. Litecoin potential is
high in the future. It offers more benefits to its users than Bitcoin:
more safety, including faster processing speeds, and lower transaction
costs. LTC is constantly being improved by tech [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/), which makes it
even more attractive to new [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s in the future.

Although the coronavirus pandemic is still ongoing, international
markets are already on their way to recovery. In response to the massive
support of central bankers from the world's major central banks,
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are increasingly looking for a hedge to counter value risk.
Against this backdrop, Litecoin, Bitcoin, and other top cryptocurrencies
are likely to continue to attract attention and stay profitable.

If Litecoin can break above its current price and hold on in the long
run, the Litecoin forecast says it will retest its all-time high. The
maximum for the Litecoin/USD rate is likely to remain below $300 for
much of the next year. If it seems that investment is unattractive, you
