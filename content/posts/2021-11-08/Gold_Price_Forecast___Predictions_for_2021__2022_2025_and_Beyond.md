Gold Price Forecast & Prediction: 2021 and BeyondJana Kane

After falling below $1200 per ounce in 2018, gold rebounded sharply over
the next 12 months, and a significant bullish trend began. Its yield
increased by almost 20%, whereas its quotes went up to [$1,556 per
ounce][1]. The rally continued in 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic increased
the popularity of the precious metal as a hedging instrument, which has
led to an increase in its price.

In January 2021, the price of gold fell due [to the Biden
administration’s ][2]$1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package. The price
of gold would fall every time the US government announced anti-
coronavirus programs and plans. In March 2021, the price declined due to
[economic recovery, which][3] was possible thanks to vaccinations. In
March, the price was $1,696.25, which was even lower than in January. At
the beginning of June, the price went up to $1.896.60 - back to
January’s figures - but failed to maintain this level and fell to
$1,755.45 due to the changes in[ the US dollar rate][4].

In this article, we'll look into [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) data, see what experts have
to say, and make a gold price forecast and prediction for 2021 and some
years ahead.

The article covers the following subjects:

## A Recent History of Gold

Western [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s' interest in gold led to an increase in its rate from
a minimum of $1160 in the summer of 2018 to a record high of [almost
$2073][5] in August of this year. During this time, the precious metal
has become one of the most attractive financial assets on the planet.
This year, the economic fallout from the pandemic and negative bond
yields have driven a record $60 billion in gold [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/) capital growth. This
is twice as much as in 2009, at the height of the financial crisis.

The pandemic has convinced [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s that gold should be part of their
portfolios. The precious metal has become a leading hedge against
volatility in equity markets and negative interest rates. Gold turned
out to be one of the most attractive assets in 2020.

Large [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s bought gold for protection against possible deflation in
some countries, which could be the result of slowing economic growth and
rising inflation in other countries as governments continue to pump
liquidity into the economy. For instance, the American bank [JPMorgan
earned about 1 billion dollars][6] this year from trading in precious
metals (mainly gold). According to the consulting company Coalition,
this year, revenue from trading in precious metals from the 50 largest
investment banks will double and reach a nine-year high of $2.5 billion.

Even Warren Buffett changed his mind about gold. Previously, he
considered precious metals a useless asset. This year, his Berkshire
Hathaway Inc. [acquired][7] 20.9 million shares of one of the world's
largest gold mining companies - Barrick Gold Corp. (Canada).

However, demand in the main gold consuming countries, India and China,
has not been up to par this year. People sold their savings in gold or
pledged them when the precious metal rose to a record high in local
currencies. The high cost of the precious yellow metal and the economic
turmoil caused by the pandemic have crippled consumer demand. Therefore,
in the first half of the year, [jewelry purchases decreased in volume by
46%][8] compared to the same period last year. The reason is quarantine
and a decrease in the income of the population.

Investors will continue to fill the gap in demand. This year, exchange-
traded funds will accumulate 1205 tons of precious metal in their
reserves, three times more than in 2019. The figure may reach 1,362 tons
next year.

Central banks have been buying precious metals quarterly since early
2011. In the third quarter of this year, they became net sellers,
reducing reserves by 12.1 tons. Nonetheless, CBRs remain net buyers
annually as demand for the first three quarters was 220.6 tons. In all
likelihood, they will maintain this status in 2020, although the volume
of purchases will be less than in the previous two years. Russia has
suspended purchases, and China has not reported an increase in reserves
since September 2019.

## Gold Price Today

The yellow metal rose 17% in the first half of 2020 and another 10% in
July, and it reached a record high of $2073 per ounce on August 6. Since
then, an ounce of gold has dropped to $1,844 amid [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) of a coronavirus
vaccine. However, the euphoria about the vaccine is premature. The
pandemic is not leaving the agenda. Nevertheless, this year's yield on
the precious metal was in the range of 16-30%. Note that many forecasts
for 2020 assumed the growth of precious metal quotations to $1600-1700
per ounce in the event of increased geopolitical and economic
instability.

The economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic continued, and
increasing inflation expectations in April and May 2021 led to a lower
price. Overall, in January-March 2021, we could see a decline in the
price of gold due to US employment figures going up. Gold dropped by
4.7% to $1,774.80 per ounce on June 16, its lowest level since late
April. The pullback came after a statement from the Federal Open Market
Committee sounded an optimistic note on the recovery of the US economy.

The current price of gold is $1 824.35.



## Gold Price Prediction for 2021: What Do Experts Predict?

In May 2021, consumers from China showed great demand for gold due to
the beginning of the holiday and wedding season. Still, the escalation
of the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted purchasing in India - one of the
major global markets.

The gold price remaining below $1,800 per ounce indicates a “lack of an
immediate impetus to buy the yellow metal,” analysts at Canadian bank TD
Securities said in June 2021, “as the Fed clarified its reaction
function with respect to an upside scenario in inflation, which suggests
the Fed isn't behind the curve by any means.”

Speaking on the gold price outlook, [Amit Sajeja, Vice President][9] of
Research at Motilal Oswal, said, "Gold price is going through
consolidation, and the trend is expected to continue for the next month
till it is trading in the range of ₹48,300 ($646.34) to ₹49,500
($662.40) per 10 gm. However, I would advise gold [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s to look at
every correction as a buying opportunity, as gold’s price outlook in the
medium-term looks positive, and it may go up to ₹51,000 ($682.47) per 10
gm in the medium-term time-horizon."

[According to analysts at Australian bank ANZ][10], "Gold's upside looks
limited by rising yield and buoyant risky assets." ANZ's gold price
prediction says that the precious metal is expected to rise up to $2,000
per ounce by the end of September but then fall back to $1,900 by the
end of 2021 and $1,800 by mid-2022.

Analysts at Citibank, as well as ABN, noted that the gold price has
dropped below technical support at $1,750-1,765 per ounce, and their
year-end target of $1,700 per ounce, before ticking higher."

According to our forecast, in 2021, there should be a rise in the rate
of gold, but not above $2,000 per ounce. The following factors will
facilitate this:

  1. The increase in inflationary expectations and the weakening of the US currency will result from generous fiscal and monetary stimulus.

  2. An increase in investment demand and a gradual recovery in consumer demand in China and India will support the precious metal rate at a high level.

  3. Government bonds (government debt) will not play the role of defensive assets in the face of inflation and negative interest rates since they will cease to generate income.

At the same time, the opportunity cost of owning gold decreases. This
will increase the popularity of the precious metal in the eyes of
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s in 2021.

All Western countries are experiencing unprecedented growth in the money
supply. From the beginning of February to the end of October, the
aggregate volume of money supply in the United States increased from
$15.4 billion to $18.8 billion, an increase of 22%. In the United
States, the Eurozone, the United Kingdom, and Japan, the figure rose
15.7% from February to September 2020. Consequently, the risk of higher
inflation in 2021 is very high.

According to Wallet Investor, the closing price for 2021 will be
$1.895.41. The prognosis for the rest of the year is positive, and no
strong declines are expected.

The Economy Forecast Agency is not so optimistic, though. Its experts
expect a downtrend until October. The price will fall to $1,508. After a
little up trending in November and December, we will see the second
decline - the closing price in December will be $1,507.

## Gold Technical Analysis

To do a high-quality technical analysis of the XAUUSD, we'll analyze its
monthly chart first.

As shown in the gold price chart above, the [XAUUSD][11] has been in a
global bullish trend since 2001. Laying the Fibonacci grid over the gold
price pattern, we'll see some development stages of the gold trend's
lifespan. I've marked five of them in the chart above:

  * 1 — Area of peak values: the red zone going from 2.618 to 3.618 as per Fibonacci ratios. The price hasn’t remained in that area for long as the market is overbought.

  * 2 — Area of dynamic development: the blue zone going from 1.618 to 2.618. The gold price is highly volatile there and can fluctuate rapidly.

  * Areas 3 and 4 are price consolidation zones. Strong support/resistance levels are near the limits of those areas, and much effort is required to break them through.

  * 5 — Area of the buyers' last hope. If the price is here, a bullish trend is likely to end soon. However, the limits of that area can provide support to the buyers and result in pullbacks.

The XAU price is currently consolidating in the area of dynamic
development, which may indicate that the trend development stages
shifted up by one stage. Thus, a projected correction is unlikely to go
below the limits of Area 3, i.e., below 1400 - 1500 USD per ounce.

### Gold Forecast For Next Three Months

I've done a similar technical analysis of gold quotes using Fibo
channels on the weekly chart to make a forecast for the next three
months.

I've marked five areas on the XAUUSD's weekly price chart for a local
bullish trend that has been developing since the end of 2018. The price
is in the consolidation area, close to the ultimate fifth level, whose
lower limit coincides with Area 2 of the global trend.

As the chart above suggests, the current gold price is moving within a
descending triangle, confirming that the global area 2 turned into a
consolidation zone. Gold's future price will most likely continue
fluctuating within that triangle, in the range of 1680 - 1830 US
dollars. A fall in trading volumes and the MACD's cascading bullish
divergences support the idea of the price's consolidation on the current
levels.

### Long-Term Gold Analysis for 2021/2022

To estimate gold's potential in the coming years, we need to understand
the direction in which the [XAUUSD][12] will go upon the triangle's
completion. The price [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) analysis of various instruments in similar
conditions points to a likelier breakout to the upside. Once the
triangle's upper edge is broken, the price target will be located on the
limits of the second global area, at around 1950 - 2000 USD. Next, there
can be a small pullback, but if the buyer is strong enough, the price
may break through the limits between area 1 and 2, reach the previous
[historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) maximum at 2074 USD, and even update it. The next target will
then be the level of 2350 US dollars.

The chart above shows the range of XAUUSD price fluctuations for each
month based on the realistic gold forecast I've made. I've calculated
the expected trading range using Bollinger bands. The table below
presents the same values in a text format.

#### Long-term trading plan for GOLD

To finalize our XAUUSD technical analysis, I suggest making a trading
plan for exploiting projected growth in the range of area 2.

I've marked two long trades with blue lines in the chart above. The
first one can be opened at the current price, at around 1745 USD. The
second one is in the buyers' activity zone, at 1690 USD. Calculate each
position's volume in a way that excludes losing more than 3% of the
deposit when Stop-loss at 1575 USD is triggered. According to that
trading plan, profits should be fixed in two areas as well: the first
half of your position in gold can be closed at the projected price of
1820 USD. The rest of gold can be sold at 1905 USD. Then, if we are
lucky to have a pullback to the previous levels, the trading plan can be
repeated.

## Gold weekly price forecast as of 08.11.2021

The gold medium-term uptrend continues, the October high has been broken
through, and the price has broken out level 1805 and consolidated above.
The next upside target is level 1832. If the price breaks out level 1832
and consolidates above, it should reach Target Zone 2, 1874 - 1865.

It is relevant to enter new purchases this week if there is a
corresponding pattern. According to the pattern, one could enter
additional long trade with the first target at level 1832.

If the price doesn’t break out level 1832 and draws a false break out
pattern, one could enter a short trade in the correction with a target
at the nearest support level. The nearest support is at level 1805. The
next support is at 1762.

[][16]

### [XAUUSD][11] Trading ideas for the week:

  1. Hold up purchases. TakeProfit: 1832, Target Zone 2, 1874 - 1865. StopLoss: at breakeven.
  2. Buy at level 1805. TakeProfit: 1832, Target Zone 2, 1874 - 1865. StopLoss: 1785.

## Gold Price Forecast 2022

On the supply side, gold production is rebounding from the shutdowns
following the start of the Corona-crisis. Analysts expect that
production will expand through 2022, given that prices are well above
production costs. The World Bank forecasts prices to average 4% lower in
2021 and decline further in 2022.

The opening price is believed to be $1,902.21. The price will go up all
the way till December 2022. In July, the opening price will reach
$2,031.39, but it won’t be able to hold this position for long. However,
the price will be able to recover, so the closing price of the last day
in December will be $2,141.7.

January 2022 will begin with the opening price of $1,507. Until the end
of the summer, some ups and downs are expected. At the end of June, the
closing price is thought to be $1,424. However, after that, we can see
stable growth up to $1,682 - that is the closing price in December.

the growth will maintain till the end of the year, when the closing
price will be $2,257.

## Gold Price Forecast 2023

Overall, the price of gold in 2023 will go up, and no significant falls
are expected. However, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s should keep in mind that this growth
will be at a slow pace. There is good [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) for long-term [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s - the
volatility in 2023 is said to be low. Let's dive into the details.

The opening price in January will be $2,156.09. The whole year will show
stable growth with slightly slower speed in September and October. At
the end of June, the average price will be $2,275.44. The last day of
2023 will leave us with $2,403.78.

The opening price in 2023 will be $1,682. In April and June, two falls
are expected. By the beginning of July, the opening price will be
$1,864. A downtrend will start in November (the month will open with
$2,063 and close with $2,054), making the closing price in December
$2,014.

$2,257 will be the price at the beginning of 2023. By the middle of the
year, it will manage to go up to $2,346. The growth will continue to
make all [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s happy, and the 31st of December will congratulate the
world with a closing price of $2,497.

## Gold Price Forecast 2025-2030

Though it is hard to say for sure for such a long period of time,
experts from different resources concur that gold will continue rising.
However, they have opposite opinions about the speed of this growth.

The opening price in 2025 will be $2,668.17. The closing price in June
2025 will be $2,800.81, and it will continue going up - at the end of
December, the closing price will be $2,922.15. The first half of 2026 is
also nice and pleasant for gold [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s. The beginning of January will
bring $2,923.75. The end of June will meet us with $3,056.73.
Unfortunately, there is no further information about the gold price.

The Economy Forecast Agency gives information only till the end of
August 2025. The beginning of the year will be marked with a small
decline. The opening price in January will be $2,085. It will continue
falling till the beginning of April when it is going to reach $2,002.
The price will grow till the beginning of June when it becomes $2,139.
It won’t be able to hold that mark for a long time and will have fallen
to $2,109 by the end of July. However, it will go up again and will rise
up to $2,126 by the end of August.

2024 will end with a closing price of $2,944. The figures will go up
drastically, and by the middle of 2025, the price will reach $3,225. The

## How Has the Price of Gold Changed Over Time?

Below is a chart that shows how the price of gold changed over the past
ten years. In order to make our predictions and forecasts as accurate as
possible, it’s important to look back to such [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) data.

One of the biggest drivers of gold [is currency values][18]. Because
gold is denominated in dollars, USD can have a significant impact on the
price of gold. A weaker dollar makes gold relatively less expensive for
foreign buyers and may lift prices. On the other hand, a stronger dollar
makes gold relatively more expensive for foreign buyers, thus possibly
lowering prices.

The price at the beginning of 2019 was $1,413.75. Though it fell
insignificantly in April to $1,353.26, it continued going up till August
and became $1,601.35. However, in November, the price lowered to
$1,524.80. The reason for this was the falling gold demand in India.
Actually, it fell to its lowest level in three years. [The World Gold
Council (WGC)][19] explained that this was due to  domestic prices
climbing to a record against a backdrop of falling earnings in rural
areas.

The price was able to recover and rose up to $2,063.56 in August 2020.
[This peak][20] hasn’t been reached again yet. [The coronavirus
pandemic][21] and the unprecedented flow of money supply by government
stimulus triggered sharp buying in the bullion metal in both domestic
and global markets in 2020.

The price didn’t manage to maintain this high and fell to $1,840.38 in
November 2020. [Pfizer][22] was the main reason. The US-based
pharmaceutical corporation announced the Covid-19 vaccine [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/). They
made a surprising announcement regarding the status of their coronavirus
vaccine trial.

The price managed to recover a little bit, but that didn’t save it from
another fall in March 2021 - it fell to $1,742.68 as the dollar[
strengthened][23] after the jump in US private-sector jobs. “Gold looked
as if it was topping out,” Ross Norman, Chief Executive Officer at
Metals Daily, said. “Some profit-taking exacerbated the decline, and
gold will rebuild from here.” He was right - in May 2021, the price
became $1,904.76. Little did he know that the price would again go down,
reaching $1,771.60 because of problems with the [coronavirus in
India][24].

## Factors That May Affect the Price of Gold

Typically, traders associate fundamental analysis with the stock market,
not gold. While fundamental stock market analysts monitor certain
companies' financial statements, gold market analysts monitor
macroeconomic factors, political and economic world stability, and
competition from investment alternatives to forecast prices. Let's look
into five macroeconomic parameters that can influence the cost of the
main precious metal.

### 1\. Inflation

Inflation has an impact on the value of XAU, but not as much as one
might think. Most novice gold [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s believe that if inflation rises
in the US, then gold price should also go up since more inflation
dollars will have to be paid per ounce. However, in the long term, there
is no strong correlation between inflation and gold prices. This can be
seen from the chart below, which shows the inflation dynamics in the US
and gold prices.

This lack of a strong correlation can be explained by two reasons:

a) Gold is not a commodity. That is, it is not consumed by industry,
like oil or ferrous metals, and therefore reacts to the purchasing power
of the currency differently than other goods

b) During periods of economic and stock market growth, gold has to
“compete” for profitability and [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) attention. Moreover, during
such periods, inflation is usually at a high level.

### 2\. Currency Fluctuations

Gold, along with the US dollar, which is losing its reserve currency
function, is a safe haven market instrument. Therefore, if the exchange
rate of one of the currencies (for example, the dollar) depreciates
relative to the other reserve currencies, while the purchasing power of
buying gold in other currencies is preserved, then the logical
consequence is the rise in the price of gold relative to the depreciated
currency. The chart shows an inverse long-term relationship between the
US dollar index (white line) and the dynamics of gold prices (yellow
line).

### 3\. The Risk of a Recession Due to War

War or the threat of war is the most significant (after financial market
crises) source of uncertainty for [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s. Gold is best used as a safe
investment in times when [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are terrified, and war may well cause
such conditions in the market. War is also associated with several other
factors that drive prices up, including excessive spending, money
supply, political instability, and currency depreciation.

### 4\. Interest Rates

Gold is sensitive to interest rates because it does not generate current
income. Therefore, it is highly sensitive to alternatives in the stock
market that offer potential income, such as bonds or even stocks that
pay dividends. There is a noticeable, albeit not perfect, negative
correlation. When US government bond yields rise, the likelihood is high
that gold will trend sideways or even downtrend, while declining yields
tend to lead to very positive movements in gold prices.

For example, to combat the recession in the early 2000s, the Fed lowered
interest rates to very low levels, forcing long-term [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s to
withdraw from low-yield bonds and diversify their portfolios with gold.
This provided good support to the already rising gold prices.

### 5\. Supply and Demand

Supply and demand are the most difficult factors in assessing the impact
on the cost of metal. Large [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s in gold, including central banks,
the IMF, and leading funds, significantly impact the market. The actions
of these participants can substantially change the demand for gold
jewellery and investment instruments.

Accounting for the actions of these large players is an impossible task
for an ordinary private [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) who does not have access to the
disclosed information of all the players' data.

For a general understanding of the market balance, you need to know that
most of the demand for gold is more or less evenly distributed between
investment instruments and jewelry.

As an example, it is shown below that China and India (with strong
economic growth) have become major buyers of gold over the past two
decades to invest and create reserves and, therefore, have provided an
additional stimulus for price increases.

## Conclusion: Is Gold a Good Investment?

Not only is gold known for being a portfolio diversifier, but with
inflation fears on the rise, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s tend to turn to gold because it
is considered a good hedge against rising prices.

"During periods of systemic risk, both gold and the dollar tend to be
used as safe havens and may move in a similar direction," says Juan
Carlos Artigas, Head of Research, World Gold Council.

We maintain a long-term positive view on gold in 2021-2030.

As new initiatives of the world's central banks and governments to
support markets and economies are implemented in 2021, gold quotes will
resume their growth. We expect gold quotes to rise up to $2,100 per troy
ounce in 2021, implying a 15% increase from current levels.
