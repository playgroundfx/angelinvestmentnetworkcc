Euro is given green light. Forecast as of 11.02.2021Dmitri Demidenko

A seasonal decline in the number of COVID-19 cases, vaccination, and
global economic recovery driven by the US and China give the green light
to the [EURUSD][1] bulls. Let us discuss the Forex outlook and make up a
trading plan.

## Weekly euro fundamental forecast

The market is like a road. If something goes not according to the plan,
some people are stepping back. The primary investment strategy now
suggests that, amid universal vaccination, mass fiscal stimuli, and
ultra-easy monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), the US, along with China, will be the growth
driver for the global GDP. If so, the risk appetite will be high,
pressing down safe-havens, such as the US dollar. One of the signs of
the US strength is the growing inflation rate. However, a poor reading
of the US consumer price index discouraged some [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s.

CPI and core inflation rose by only 1.4% in January, although there was
much talk before the data release that the adoption of the $ 1.9 billion
stimulus package would overheat the economy. The growing money supply,
the Fed’s unwillingness to take away the punch bowl in the middle of the
party, and the expected boom in consumer spending should have
accelerated the US inflation. It is not the case now.

### Dynamics of US inflation

An essential element of the global economic rebound is the Fed’s
position. In December, the Federal Reserve projected the US GDP should
grow by 4.2% in 2021, and the interest rate should be at the current
level of 0%-0.25% at least through the end of 2023. Joe Biden's massive
fiscal stimulus and rapid vaccination should encourage the Fed to revise
the forecast up. According to Oxford Economics, US GDP will grow by 5.9%
this year, and the derivatives market expects the Fed to hike the
federal fund rate at the end of 2022.

### Dynamics of Fed and ECB interest rates and market expectations for
changes

In the current situation, it is imperative for the Fed that market
forecasts do not go even higher, and Jerome Powell is doing everything
possible to convince [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s that the US central bank will not
implement any changes in the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) for a long time. According
to the Fed Chair, the Fed’s members do not consider abandoning the
economic assistance by raising the interest rates or pulling back on the
QE. The Fed is still willing to put up with high inflation, as the
inflation surge should be temporary. In the last decade, disinflationary
forces have been affecting the global economy. The advanced economies
spared no effort to reach the 2% target, but they failed. Will anything
change after the pandemic? Powell does not think so.

By and large, the current market factors should support the euro growth.
The Fed is not going to abandon its ultra-soft monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), and the
seasonal recession of the pandemic and vaccinations strengthen the hope
for the rapid growth of the global economy. Furthermore, vaccinations
are essential. According to Israeli scientists, a vaccinated person
carries between 5% and 62% of the viral load. This means less serious
illness and a reduced chance of transmission of COVID-19, which is
extremely important both for the individual and humanity. Vaccination is
also important for the global economy and [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) plans.

### Weekly [EURUSD][1] trading plan

In my opinion, the [EURUSD][1] bulls are given the green light as the
investment ideas, based on the global economic rebound, popular in late
2020, are coming back to Forex. We can use the drawdowns to enter long
trades with targets at 1.221 and 1.225.
