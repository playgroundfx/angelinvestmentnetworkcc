Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 11.02.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

The XRPUSD market seems to have completed the triple zigzag; there is
forming a bearish impulse currently.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

In the most recent chart section, there is forming the final leg of the
large upward impulse. The bearish correction 4 completed as a triple
zigzag. Next, the market turned up and started rising. There is now
developing the bullish wave 5 that is composed of the sub-waves
[1]-[2]-[3]-[4]-[5]. The first two sub-waves have fished within the
indicated pattern, wave [3] is still developing. The price should be
rising to a level of 49600.00. Next, the market could be declining in
the corrective wave [4].

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

After the upward linking wave (X) had finished, the Ripple price sharply
dropped. There could be forming a down wave W as a bearish zigzag
[A]-[B]-[C]. There have completed the impulse wave [A] and the
corrective wave [B], which is a triple zigzag. There is forming the
initial element of the final impulse wave [C]. Wave [C] should finish
below the previous low, made by the linking wave (xx), at 0.382.

### Trading plan for **[XRPUSD][2]** today:

## Elliott wave Ethereum analysis

The hourly timeframe displays the final section of the large impulse
wave. The market has completed the horizontal correction 4 as a
triangle. Next, the price has started growing in impulse 5. Four out of
five legs must have finished in impulse 5. Therefore, the market should
be rising in the final upward wave [v] to a level of 1945.00. One could
enter long positions in the current situation.
