Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 17.11.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

The short-term euro downtrend continued, within which the Target Zone 2
1.1340 - 1.1322 was broken out.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

The oil resistance zone of ​​81.12 - 79.59 was held. Today the price
continued to fall. The target of the fall is the November 15 low in the
Target Zone ​​78.48 - 77.97. In case of the TZ breakout and price
consolidation below at the US session, the downtrend will continue with
the target in the Gold Zone 75.93 - 75.67.

Today it is reasonable for traders to hold down sales entered in the
resistance zone and open new short trades according to the pattern.

The short-term trend reversal up by breaking out the Intermediary Zone
and price consolidation above level 81.12 at the US trading session is
required for oil purchases.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

Hold down sales entered in the zone of 81.12 - 79.59. TakeProfit: 78.48.
StopLoss: at the breakeven.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

The gold Target Zone 3 1875 - 1871 was held. After that, the XAU price
began to fall. As a result, the short-term uptrend's key support 1858 -
1856 was broken out. Thus, the short-term trend reversed down. Now the
target for sales is the lower Target Zone 1839 - 1836.

It is profitable to enter new short trades on correction in the zone of
​​favorable prices 1870 - 1856. To enter trades, it is required that the
price enters the resistance zone and then forms a sell pattern. The
first target for taking profit is today's low.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

Sell according to the pattern in the zone of 1870 - 1856. TakeProfit:
1850, Target Zone 1839 - 1836. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

The short-term euro downtrend continued, within which the Target Zone 2
1.1340 - 1.1322 was broken out. Today traders tried to reach the Gold
Zone 2 1.1252 - 1.1243. It didn't work out the first time. As a result,
the price went into correction and tested the Additional Zone 1.1311 -
1.1307.

The Additional Zone is the first zone to search for sales according to
the pattern. The second zone to enter short trades is the Intermediary
Zone 1.1360 - 1.1351. The IZ also serves as the trend border.

Today it is profitable to consider new euro sales according to the
pattern in the above-mentioned margin zones. Consider today's low of the
day as the first target.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

  1. Sell according to the pattern in Additional Zone 1.1311 - 1.1307. TakeProfit: 1.1265, Gold Zone 2 1.1252 - 1.1243. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. Sell according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 1.1360 - 1.1351. TakeProfit: 1.1265, Gold Zone 2 1.1252 - 1.1243. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.
