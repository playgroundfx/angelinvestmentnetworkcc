Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 17.11.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

The Ripple price should soon start rising in the final leg of the global
triangle. Let us explore the market situation in more detail.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

The large impulse wave (A) has already finished. The Bitcoin price is
now declining in the new downward impulse of a smaller degree, namely in
its initial part. Two small sub-waves 1 and 2 may have completed, and
there is unfolding the beginning of the third wave. A small impulse [1]
must have finished, so the BTCUSD market should be rising in correction
[2] to a level of 64360.55.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 59612.00, TP 64360.55

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

The XRPUSD market continues developing the linking wave (X) as a
horizontal contracting triangle A-B-C-D-E. Wave D is currently unfolding
as a simple zigzag [A]-[B]-[C]. The price should go down to a level of
1.045, which is the support. Next, the market will be rising in the
final wave E as outlined in the chart. One could enter sell trades in
the current situation.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] **** today:

Sell 1.081, TP 1.045

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

The most recent section of the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) ETHUSD chart displays corrective
wave 4 completed as a zigzag [A]-[B]-[C]. Impulse wave [A] and
correction [B], composed of sub-waves (A)-(B)-(C), have completed. The
bearish impulse wave [C] has also finished. The Ethereum price should be
rising in sub-wave 5 to a level of 4673.00, marked by impulse sub-wave
[3], and higher.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Buy 4162.56, TP 4673.00
