Yen is at the crossroads. Forecast as of 17.11.2021Dmitri Demidenko

The weakening of the yen against the US dollar to the lowest levels for
more than four years looks logical. There are significant differences in
the economy and monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the United States and Japan. What's
in store for [USDJPY][1]? Let us discuss the Forex outlook and make up a
trading plan.

## Fundamental Japanese Yen forecast for six months

In Forex, as in life, there are random events, and there are logical
ones. The rise of [USDJPY][1] to the maximum levels since March 2017 is
logical. Different ways for the recovery of the US and Japanese
economies and different views of central banks on monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) are
sure signs of the yen's weakness. The JPY has lost more than 10% of its
value against the USD since the beginning of the year.

The 3% QoQ drop in Japan's GDP in the third quarter upset not only
Bloomberg experts, who predict a slower economic contraction of 0.7%,
but also Haruhiko Kuroda. The Governor of the Bank of Japan immediately
announced that he was not going to copy others. He doesn't care if most
central banks normalize or intend to normalize monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). Until
the 2% inflation target is reached, BoJ intends to use existing monetary
incentives and add new ones.

The BoJ's views are fundamentally different from those of the Fed. The
US regulator is going to end QE within eight months and start raising
the federal funds rate in the second half of 2022. At the same time, the
derivatives market expects two or three acts of monetary restriction
next year, while St. Louis Fed President James Bullard calls on the
central bank to act more aggressively. Otherwise, the Fed may lose
control over inflation.

Divergence in monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) contributes to the widening of the yield
spreads for the US and Japanese bonds. This leads to an overflow of
capital from Asia to North America and an increase in the [USDJPY][1]
price.

### Dynamics of [USDJPY][1] and differential of US and Japanese bond
yields

The USDJPY has closely approached the psychologically important level of
115, and different banks and investment companies have opposite views on
the pair’s further trend. JP Morgan doesn't believe the [USDJPY][1] will
continue growing on the federal funds rate hike expectations, as the Fed
will hardly raise the rates more than twice in 2022. Level 115 has been
a barrier for both bulls and bears for a long time, so the price will
hardly break it out easily.

Conversely, Daiwa Securities notes the US dollar uptrend is strong, and
the breakout of level 115 will move the pair to a new trading range.
Furthermore, the demand for greenback will increase with the price rise.
In general, most large banks and investment companies are bullish on the
[USDJPY][1]. UBS, HSBC, Bank of America, and Invesco Investment
recommend their clients to buy the pair.

### [USDJPY][1] trading plan for six months

I don’t think the [USDJPY][1] trend will radically change in the next
6-12 months. High inflation in the US will encourage the Fed to tighten
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) aggressively, while the Bank of Japan is likely to
maintain its ultra-easy monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) for a long time. Therefore, I
suggest the US dollar should be rising against the Japanese yen to 117
and 119. Hold long trades entered [at 113.3 and 113.7][2] and add up to
them on the corrections.
