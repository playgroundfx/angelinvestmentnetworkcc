Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 30.03.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

Euro price continues falling within a short-term downtrend.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

Oil reached its main target within a short-term uptrend. Target Zone
62.84 - 62.33 has been tested. Now the price is rolling down from the
resistance level and approaching strong intraday support in the
Additional Zone 60.95 - 60.83.

If traders' reaction to the Additional Zone can be observed, look for a
buy entry point with a target to update the day's high.

If the support is broken out, then there will be an opportunity to start
selling into the correction with the target in the Intermediary Zone
59.68 - 59.42.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

  1. Buy according to the pattern in Additional Zone 60.95 - 60.83. TakeProfit: 62.33. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. Sell when the Additional Zone 60.95 - 60.83 is broken out. TakeProfit: Intermediary Zone 59.68 - 59.42. StopLoss: beyond the local high.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

Today, gold will test the border of the short-term uptrend 1700. Look
for purchases within the trend. To enter purchases, wait for the pattern
to form. Consider level 1755 and the Target Zone 1786 - 1776 as targets.

Selling the gold requires a breakout of the Intermediary Zone 1705 -
1700, and price consolidation below at the US trading session. In this
case, the trend will reverse down, and the target for sales will be the
lower Target zone 1655 - 1645.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

Buy according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 1705 - 1700.
TakeProfit: 1755. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

Euro price continues falling within a short-term downtrend. Today,
traders reached the Gold Zone 1.1750 - 1.1742. If it is broken out, the
next target for sales will be Target Zone 2 1.1670 - 1.1653.

If the Gold Zone is held by traders, a correction will occur. A
correction is a chance to enter new euro sales with a target at a local
low. The Additional Zone 1.1784 - 1.1780 and the Intermediary Zone
1.1828 - 1.1820 are among the nearest resistances.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

Sell according to the pattern in Additional Zone 1.1784 - 1.1780.
TakeProfit: 1.1742. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.
