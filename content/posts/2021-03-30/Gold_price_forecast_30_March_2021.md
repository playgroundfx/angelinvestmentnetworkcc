China created problems for gold. Forecast as of 30.03.2021Dmitri
Demidenko

Last year gold price reached a [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) high, but in 2021, the
precious metal lost its shine. What was China's role? Let us discuss the
Forex outlook and make up a gold trading plan.

## Fundamental gold forecast for a week

Gold has not been able to go against the wind for long, although it
resisted rising Treasury yields and the strengthening US dollar. While
gold has traditionally been perceived as a hedge against inflation, it
should be understood that the expected surge in consumer prices reflects
economic growth. In addition, it is unlikely to be long-term.

Gold is on the verge of its first quarterly close in the red since 2018
amid rapid US vaccination rates, massive fiscal stimulus, and improved
US GDP forecasts. It seems that the market has finally believed the Fed,
which considers the potential surge in inflation to be temporary, and
turns a blind eye to the rapid rally in debt market rates. This fact
discourages [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/) buyers from acquiring the assets of specialized
exchange-traded funds and contributes to the first drop in [XAUUSD][1]
prices in three months.

### Monthly gold dynamics

A strong dollar and booming Treasury bond yields are highly damaging for
gold price. Whether the structural factors such as an aging population
and low productivity that have taken place over the past several decades
can prevent a further rally in US debt market rates or not, but the
rates are going up. It is likely that by the end of 2021, the yield on
10-year securities will rise to 2%. Even considering the costs of
hedging against currency risks, yield levels have been the most
attractive for foreign [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s since 2015.

### Treasury yield dynamics, including hedging

In my opinion, China played an important role in breaking the gold
uptrend. In 2020, China invested about $500 billion in public investment
to support its economy. This has led to an increase in imports of a
range of commodities from oil to steel. As a result of rising commodity
prices, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s began to think about accelerating inflation, which
created favorable conditions for gold.

In 2021, the situation has changed. China is focusing on reorienting the
economy from investment to consumption and fighting over-indebtedness.
With the largest economy in Asia accounting for about 60% of raw
materials demand, the correction in commodity market assets is
understandable. Nickel prices fell by 18% in March, cobalt - by 13%,
copper - by 9%. Even oil could not avoid a pullback. Such dynamics give
rise to doubts about the acceleration of inflation and puts pressure on
gold.

### Weekly gold trading plan

According to OANDA, if the gold breaks the support at $1,700 and $1,670
per ounce, the downward movement will be surprisingly fast. Shortly it
will be possible to observe the reaching of the $1600 mark. In the third
article in a row, I talk about breaking the gold uptrend and recommend
selling the precious metal in the direction of $1675 and $1640. [Hold
the shorts formed in the level of $1730][2] and continue to use the
growth of gold prices to add up to short positions.
