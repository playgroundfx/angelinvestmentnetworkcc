Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 30.03.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

Bitcoin and Ethereum are about to finish impulse sub-waves, so, there
could soon start a correction.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

The BTCUSD market continues forming the final part of the large bullish
impulse, wave 5. Wave 5 is composed of the sub-waves
[1]-[2]-[3]-[4]-[5]. There is now developing the middle part of the
impulse pattern, impulse [3]. Most likely, the price is now rising in
the last sub-wave (5). The market could continue growing to a level of
59860.00, which is the previous high. Next, the market could slightly
decline in the corrective sub-wave [4].

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 57472.00, TP 59860.00

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

The XRPUSD market continues forming the ending diagonal (C). After the
corrective down wave 4 completed as a double zigzag, there have finished
the impulse wave [a] and the bearish corrective wave [b] as a zigzag
(A)-(B)-(C). There is now developing the initial part of the impulse
wave [c], which could conclude the final, fifth leg of the diagonal at a
level of 0.645. The nearest target for purchases is level 0.600, marked
by wave 3.

completed the corrective wave 4 as a zigzag. Next, the market has
reversed and started forming the initial part of the zigzag-shaped wave
5. The first impulse wave [a] should complete at a level of 1890.00,
where correction (2) finished. Next, the market should decline in
