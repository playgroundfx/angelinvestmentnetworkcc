Dollar is always right. Forecast as of 30.03.2021Dmitri Demidenko

There is one step from great to ridiculous. Just as the euro was the top
favorite in early 2021, the US dollar seems to be the best-performing
currency in Forex. Will the euro bulls managed to gain their positions
back? Let us discuss the Forex outlook and make up a [EURUSD][1] trading
plan.

## Weekly US dollar fundamental forecast

The US dollar seems to be always at a profit. Whatever happens,
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s have arguments to enter dollar longs. The escalation of the
US-China conflict, including the resumption of the trade war, is a
reason to buy the greenback. Correction of the US stock indexes is a
reason to buy the greenback. New stimulus from Joe Biden's government
and the associated increase in reflation trade are reasons to buy the
greenback. However, the lack of flexibility could result in a loss.

The GDP growth difference between the US and the euro area in the first
quarter may reach 10%. The US manufacturing PMI will rise above 60, and
inflation will soon reach 3-4%. So, the [EURUSD][1] downtrend is natural
and will hardly end soon. Traders like to draw [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) parallels, and
the euro's failure to break through to $1.25 gives rise to sad memories
of 2017-2018.

Due to rapid vaccination roll-out and an additional $1.9 trillion fiscal
stimulus from Joe Biden, experts surveyed by IHS Markit upgraded the
forecast for the US GDP for 2021 from 4% to 6.3%, the Fed - from 4.2% to
6.5%. Furthermore, [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) shows that economists tend to underestimate
the expected growth during GDP expansion. With a new $3 trillion aid
package and a $2.9 trillion increase in US households' savings during
2020, the US GDP could expand even more. Likewise, the growth gap
between the USA and the euro area should also widen, which has always
supported the [EURUSD][1] bears.

### Dynamics of [EURUSD][2] and the ratio of expected GDP growth in USA
and euro area

The euro must have new advantages to change the trend, and the European
currency has yet more flaws than benefits. Germany’s unwillingness to
ratify the European recovery fund project, the third COVID-19 wave, the
increased volumes of the ECB asset purchases under the PEPP (in the week
ended March 25, the central bank acquired securities for €19 billion,
which is higher than the average value since the beginning of the
program), as well as the aggravation of the US-China relations, which
could result in a new round of the trade war, make it unprofitable to
buy the [EURUSD][1].

The dollar looks like the top performer, just as the euro did in early
2021. Forex situation changes very fast, and everything could turn
upside down at any moment. The dollar could lose its dominance very
quickly, but there are no reasons for it now. Moreover, the growth of
the US employment by 643,000 and a drop in unemployment to 6%, as
Bloomberg experts expect, should support the Treasury yields rally,
pushing up the USD.

### Weekly [EURUSD][1] trading plan

The March jobs report will be published on the last day of the quarter,
when the stock market is closed for the Good Friday holiday, which
increases the risk of unexpected market moves. Financial managers re-
balance the portfolios at that time, and the thin pre-holiday market
could swing up and down. It is dangerous to trade in such conditions,
and [EURUSD][1] consolidation around level 1.176 looks logical. If the
bulls fail to hold the price above this level, the euro will continue
falling, but I would wait and look.
