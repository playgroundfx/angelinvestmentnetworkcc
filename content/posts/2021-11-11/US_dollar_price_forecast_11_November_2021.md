Dollar is to win. Forecast as of 11.11.2021Dmitri Demidenko

A surge in the US inflation to 6.2% caused panic in financial markets.
Stocks crashed, Treasury yield has been up amid the expectations of the
Fed’s aggressive monetary restriction. How will this affect the
[EURUSD][1]? Let us discuss the Forex outlook and make up a trading
plan.

## Weekly US dollar fundamental forecast

The release of US consumer price data for October explains why [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s
are not interested in the question of whether the Fed will raise
interest rates. They are more concerned with how fast the federal funds
rate will be raised. Although San Francisco Federal Reserve President
Mary Daly said that the “eye-popping” inflation data should abate after
pandemic effects wane, and it’s too early to make adjustments to the
trajectory of interest rate changes. But the market doesn’t believe her,
and [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s seem to be right.

According to the Labor Department, consumer prices in October jumped to
6.2%, core inflation to 4.6%, which in both cases is the highest value
in more than three decades. The CPI has surpassed 5% for the fifth month
in a row and casts doubt on the Fed’s mantra about the temporary nature
of high inflation. The derivatives market expects that the central bank
will be forced to tighten its monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). CME derivatives give a
64% chance of raising the federal funds rate by June, up from a 51% pre-
consumer price data release. The chances of two rate hikes in 2022
increased from 63% to 80%, by three — from 29% to 49%. Therefore, the US
dollar has naturally strengthened.

The greenback was also supported by the rise in Treasury yields. For
2-year securities, it jumped at the fastest pace since March 2020 and
returned to the area of annual highs. A surge in inflation is not good
[news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) for debt obligations; in this scenario, the purchasing power of
coupons paid on bonds decreases, and the chances of the Fed’s monetary
tightening increase.

### Dynamics of Treasury yields

The rise in Treasury yields has been followed by the rising yields on
other countries’ bonds. In Canada, the overnight rate is now expected to
rise by 100 basis points in 2022, and even the ECB, according to
markets, may raise the deposit rate next year. This does not contradict
the opinion of the governor of the Bank of Austria, Robert Holzmann,
claiming that the ECB can completely finish the QE, including the APP,
by September. On the other hand, the European Commission is to publish a
forecast according to which inflation in the euro area will slow down
from 2.4% in 2021 to 2.2% in 2022 and 1.4% in 2023, which implies long-
term preservation of the ECB’s ultra-easy monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).

Therefore, the ECB remains patient while the Fed is forced to take
action. The US central bank has already expressed its doubts that the
surge in inflation will quickly subside. The Fed’s officials suggest the
inflation will remain high longer than previously thought. Investors
wonder how the Fed can afford to wait at this level of consumer prices.
And what exactly is the central bank waiting for? Is it Jerome Powell’s
re-election, perhaps?

### Weekly [EURUSD][1] trading plan

After all, the CPI surge sent the [EURUSD][1] down as was expected. The
[shorts][2] entered at the breakout of level 1.157 ahead of the US
inflation report seem to be profitable. The earlier indicated
[target][3] at 1.145 could soon be reached.
