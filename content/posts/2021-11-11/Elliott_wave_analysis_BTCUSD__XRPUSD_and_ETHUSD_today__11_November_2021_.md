Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 11.11.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

Bitcoin and Ethereum should be rising in impulses, and Ripple continues
forming the final leg of the double zigzag.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

The BTCUSD market is forming the first sub-wave of the simple bullish
zigzag (A)-(B)-(C), large impulse upwave (A). Sub-waves 1-2-3-4 have
completed in the (A) wave, the final fifth wave is still developing.
Horizontal corrective wave 4 of a smaller degree has recently finished
as a double three [W]-[X]-[Y], it is an element of the upward impulse
(5) of [5]. The Bitcoin price should go up in a small wave [5] to a
level of 73100.00, where wave 5 will be 50% of wave 3.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 67917.50, TP 73100.00

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

The XRPUSD chart displays the structure of the large linking wave (X),
with the final sub-wave unfolding inside as a double zigzag [W]-[X]-[Y].
The [X] is a flat (A)-(B)-(C). There is now unfolding the upward wave
[Y] as a double zigzag (W)-(X)-(Y). Impulse wave A, the first sub-wave
of the zigzag-shaped wave (Y), has completed. The market should be
declining in correction B; next, the price could be rising in the C
impulse to a level of 1.380, as outlined in the chart.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] **** today:

Buy 1.318, TP 1.380

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

The ETHUSD market is forming the impulse upwave [5] composed of sub-
waves (1)-(2)-(3)-(4)-(5). The first four parts of this pattern, sub-
waves (1)-(2)-(3)-(4), have finished, and the upward wave (5) is
forming. The price could go down a little in correction 4; next, it will
continue rising in sub-wave 5 to a level of 4930.00, as outlined in the
chart.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Buy 4796.78, TP 4930.00
