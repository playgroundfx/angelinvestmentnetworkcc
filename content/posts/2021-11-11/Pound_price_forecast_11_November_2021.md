Pound's positions are weak. Forecast as of 11.11.2021Dmitri Demidenko

The Bank of England disappointed [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s in November and is ready to
do it again if the UK jobs report is disappointing. Why would the
British regulator use hawkish rhetoric? Let us discuss the market
outlook and make up a [GBPUSD][1] trading plan.

## Weekly pound fundamental forecast

If a person lied once, they can believe him. It won't work the second
time though. And if later a person tells the truth, no one will accept
it either. The statement of the Bank of England, which claimed before
the November MPC meeting that it was ready to act, and then decided not
to raise the interest rate, [as expected][2], brought down the
[GBPUSD][1] price to 1.35. After that, the pound tried to recover, but
was pushed even lower to the lowest levels since December, due to the
release of US inflation data for October. The British central bank is
again talking about tightening monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), but will [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s
believe it a second time?

Markets rise on expectations and fall on disappointments. The good [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/)
in the form of a possible increase in the interest rate from 0.1% to
0.25% was taken into account in sterling prices thanks to Andrew
Bailey's hawkish rhetoric. This was followed by a sell-off on facts.
Also, a correction occurred again, provoked by the speeches of BoE
officials. The head of the Bank of England said that monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
will still be tightened, and the reason the Committee did not do this in
November is a lack of information. The decision, as I noted, was made
blindly, because there was about a half-month left until the important
UK jobs report.

As a result, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s continue to believe that the interest rate will
rise in 2021. They expect borrowing costs to rise to 1% by the end of
2022. This is slightly lower than the 1.25% projected before the
November MPC meeting, but still quite high. By comparison, CME
derivatives suggest that the federal funds rate will only rise to 0.75%
next year.

### Dynamics of expectations of interest rate changes

Why should the Bank of England constantly use hawkish rhetoric? Because
without it, the pound is doomed. The slowdown in the UK economy, fiscal
consolidation, high commodity prices and the return of the Brexit
problem makes pound positions extremely vulnerable. Its weakening is an
additional factor in favor of stimulating inflation, which the BoE would
not like.

According to the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, UK
GDP will slow down from 6.9% in 2021 to 4.7% in 2022 and to 1.7% in
2023. In the third quarter, economic growth rates fell to 1.3%, which is
slightly lower than the estimates of Bloomberg experts and the Bank of
England at 1.5%. It is currently 2.1% less than it was at the start of
the pandemic.

The prolongation of the conflict over Northern Ireland puts pressure on
the sterling. London is threatening to use Article 16 of the Brexit
Agreement, which any party can resort to if it believes the agreement
has caused serious economic, social or environmental difficulties.
Brussels promises to respond with an arbitration claim, tougher checks
at the border and even suspending the Agreement on Trade and
Cooperation.

### Weekly [GBPUSD][1] trading plan

Alas, the pound is still standing only thanks to the Bank of England,
which cannot always be trusted. At the same time, a strong UK jobs
report may inspire [GBPUSD][1] bulls to strengthen. At the same time,
focus on sales while the pair is trading below 1.346.
