Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 27.05.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency

All three cryptocurrencies are forming upward zigzags. The first two
parts must have completed within the zigzags; so, there should be
unfolding upward impulses.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

There is developing the initial part of the new down wave. There is
likely to be forming a bearish impulse, with sub-waves 1 and 2 completed
inside. There has also completed sub-wave [1] of wave 3. Within wave
[1], there is a truncated wave (5), as it is shorter than wave (3).
There is developing the corrective upwave [2] as a simple zigzag
(A)-(B)-(C). the price should be rising in the (C) impulse to a level of
48300.00, where wave [2] will retrace wave [1] by 61.8%.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 37575.50, TP 48300.00

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

There should be unfolding a large descending double zigzag composed of
sub-waves (W)-(X)-(Y). There has completed the first sub-wave, the
motive wave (W) as a simple zigzag A-B-C. There is developing the
linking wave (X), which could also be a zigzag A-B-C. The Ripple price
may rise to a level of 1.187 in the impulse wave C, as it is outlined in
the chart.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] today:

Buy 0.952 TP 1.187

## Elliott wave Ethereum analysis

There is forming the initial part of the impulse down wave. The first
sub-wave 1 must have completed as an impulse. There is developing the
upward correction 2 as a simple zigzag. The first two sub-waves [A] and
[B] may have completed, so the price could be rising in the impulse wave
[C] to a level of 3323.00. At this level, wave 2 will be 61.8% of wave
1.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:
