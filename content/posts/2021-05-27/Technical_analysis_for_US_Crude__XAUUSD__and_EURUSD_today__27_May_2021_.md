Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 27.05.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

Yesterday, a gold correction began, within which the Additional Zone
1901 - 1900 was broken out.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

Oil is trading in a correction to a short-term uptrend. Now traders are
testing Micro-zone 65.59 - 65.53. Holding the level and forming a buy
pattern will make the oil price grow and reach the resistance level of
66.21.

The breakout of the Micro-zone will lead to the test of the Additional
Zone 64.93 - 63.80. After this, it will be relevant to open a short
trade according to the rules of money management.

The Additional Zone is a stronger support. It is possible to enter
purchases at the beforementioned AZ according to the pattern with the
target at level 66.15.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

  1. Buy according to the pattern in Micro-zone 65.59 - 65.53. TakeProfit: 66.21. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. Sell when Micro-zone 65.59 - 65.53 is broken out. TakeProfit: Additional Zone 64.93 - 63.80. StopLoss: beyond the next local high.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

Yesterday, a gold correction began, within which the Additional Zone
1901 - 1900 was broken out. Now the Intermediary Zone 1890 - 1888 serves
as the traders' target.

The resistance zone of 1903-1902 was reached today. It is possible to
look for sales at this resistance with a target in the Intermediary
Zone. If the level of 1903 is broken out, then start looking for
purchases again.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

  1. Sell according to the pattern in Additional Zone 1903 - 1902. TakeProfit: Intermediary Zone 1890 - 1888. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. If the price breaks out the Additional Zone 1903 - 1902, buy. TakeProfit: 1910. StopLoss: beyond the local low.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

The euro price corrected down to the Intermediary Zone 1.2178 - 1.2169.
This is the border of the short-term uptrend. If traders hold the zone
and form a pattern, open a long trade with the target at level 1.2260.

If the price breaks out level 1.2164 and consolidates below it, the
short-term trend will reverse down. In this case, sell the euro with the
target at the lower Target Zone 1.2090 - 1.2072.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

Buy according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 1.2178 - 1.2169.
TakeProfit: 1.2260. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.
