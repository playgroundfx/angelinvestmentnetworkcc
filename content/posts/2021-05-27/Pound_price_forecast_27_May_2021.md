Pound's numerous growth drivers. Forecast as of 27.05.2021Dmitri
Demidenko

The British currency is ranked second after the Canadian dollar among
the best G10 performers of the year and hopes to surpass its main
competitor. But how? Let us discuss the Forex outlook and make up a
[GBPUSD][1] trading plan

## Monthly pound fundamental forecast

Everyone needs a rest. Markets are no exception. The fatigue that has
accumulated after the [GBPUSD][1] rapid rally during the first two
decades of May results in the pair's consolidation at the very end of
spring. Due to the small number of economic events, the pound prefers to
react to the situation following the [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) from the US. Investors digest
information about the FOMC reasoning for the US QE program tapering and
wonder if they should be afraid of repeating the story of the 2013 taper
tantrum?

Sterling is changing bullish drivers like a woman changes clothes. In
the second half of 2020, the pound has strengthened due to market
confidence that a Brexit agreement will be concluded. In the first half
of 2021, GBP rallied thanks to accelerated vaccinations, expectations of
faster GDP growth over the US and other peers, and the belief that the
Bank of England will begin to normalize monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) ahead of the
Fed. The list of the pound's advantages does not end there.

The exchange rate on Forex is determined by investment and trading
flows. For the companies and individuals that generate these flows, the
underestimation of the monetary unit and the assets denominated in it is
of great importance. The sterling is currently worth 6% and 13% less
against the US dollar and euro than before the 2016 Brexit referendum.
Its trade-weighted rate is 15% lower than its 40-year average.

At the same time, the [FTSE 100][2] P/E ratio is 13.8, while [S&P
500][3]'s is 21.4. Considering that a significant part in the structure
of the main UK stock index is occupied by shares of the banking, mining,
and energy sectors, which are sensitive to the global economic recovery,
we can safely speak about the increase in the attractiveness of
undervalued British assets and predict capital inflows to the country.
Moreover, according to forecasts by almost 300 Reuters experts, 17 major
world stock indexes will continue to rally in 2021, with most of them
increasing in double-digit numbers. This is bad [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) for the US dollar,
which usually falls due to the improved global risk appetite, and good
[news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) for the undervalued pound.

The Bank of England expects the UK economy to expand by 7.25% in 2021,
which is higher than the Fed and the National Association for Business
Economics forecasts for US GDP by 6.5% and 6.7%, respectively. Andrew
Bailey and his colleagues have already cut weekly asset purchases under
the QE program from £4.4bn to £3.4bn. Although Bank of England officials
avoid the phrase “QE program tapering”, a step towards normalizing
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) has been made.

### [GBPUSD][1] trading plan for a month

The abovementioned factors allow me to maintain a [GBPUSD][1] bullish
forecast. Its rollbacks in the direction of 1.4045-1.4065 and 1.398-1.4
should be used to enter long trades in the direction of the previously
announced targets at 1.433 and 1.45.
