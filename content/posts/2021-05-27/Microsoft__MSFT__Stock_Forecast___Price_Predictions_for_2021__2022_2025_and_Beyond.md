Microsoft (MSFT) Stock Price Prediction: Among the Best Tech PicksJana
Kane

Out of the mega-cap names ($500 billion-plus), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT)
stock performance in 2020 stood out the most. This came as a bit of
surprise, as during the same period, most stocks struggled to stay above
water. Not only did Microsoft increase its market value in 2020, but it
also provided outstanding quarterly revenue through the first quarter of
2021.

Most [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s would agree that [MSFT][1] isn't going away any time
soon. The range of products as well as subscription-based services form
a solid foundation to generate recurring revenue well into the future.

The article covers the following subjects:

On such a positive note, how high can Microsoft stock go in 2021? And in
10 years? Find out in this Microsoft stock price forecast!

The first time [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s could get their hands on Microsoft as a
publicly-traded company in 1986 under the leadership of Bill Gates. MSFT
share price was $21, which, adjusted for subsequent splits, was around
7.2 cents.

In 2014, longtime Microsoft executive Satya Nadella became the third CEO
in the company's [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/), succeeding Steve Ballmer. The current price on
28.05.2021 for an MSFT share is 249.69 USD.

## What Will Affect Microsoft's Price in 2021 and Beyond?

Broadly speaking, most stocks are affected by the same set of factors,
including supply and demand, company [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) and performance, ongoing
domestic and international events, and [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) sentiment.

For this section, though, we'll take a more detailed look at a few
fundamental factors affecting MSFT stock projections.

### New Products

Out of a wide range of developments, here are a few areas to get excited
about:

  * Surface Duo phone: A phone with a price tag of $1,399.99 sounds like an expensive proposition compared to the iPhone 12's $729-$999 price range. But the new device supposedly brings together the absolute best of Microsoft in partnership with Google.

  * Windows 10X: A new version of Microsoft's OS, specially designed and [optimize](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/17/added-genetic-algorithm-for-trading/)d for dual-screen devices.

  * SQ1 custom Arm chip: A laptop chip developed in partnership with Qualcomm.

  * MetaOS: A single mobile platform with a consistent set of work and play services.

  * Revisited Universal Search: Made people-centric and not tied to any particular device.

  * The Intelligent Edge: Cloud intelligence for IoT and more.

  * Cloud PC: Desktop-as-a-service offering.

As higher earnings drive stock prices up, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are curious to
observe the success of each product launch. This applies not only to a
long-term investment but also to stock trading activity.

### Acquisitions

Recent and upcoming acquisitions can also shed light on where the stock
will head. Assuming Microsoft takes them in the right direction, here
just a few niche examples of where the company is attempting to
strengthen its positions:

  * Microsoft Cloud Healthcare with Nuance to provide an AI layer at the point of delivery;

  * Gaming with ZeniMax Media to deliver Bethesda exclusives on Xbox and PC, and Discord to focus on creators and communities;

  * Social media space with TikTok (if the Oracle deal fails) to host the network in the US.

### Ability to Sustain Demand

The use of cloud services was so high in 2020 that Microsoft had been
slowing some "non-essential" Office 365 services. That strong demand
will likely continue, following commercial wins with private companies
and a $10 billion deal with the U.S. Defense Department. As long as
Microsoft consistently scales to meet demand, the stock quote should
increase.

## MSFT Stock Forecast for 2021: Analysts Recommendations

Top analysts shared their [Microsoft stock price targets][2] and
notified their clients of their Buy or Sell ratings.

### Brent Thill, Jefferies Financial Group

[Brent Thill][3] at Jefferies Financial Group lowered his price target
from $300.00 to $290.00 in a recent report. The analyst noted that the
move was a valuation call. The firm currently maintains the Strong Buy
rating on the stock.

### John McPeake, Rosenblatt Securities

 ****

[John McPeake][4] at Rosenblatt Securities initiated coverage of the
software giant with a Strong Buy rating. The analyst's target price is
set at $301. He noted that Microsoft has unmatched assets and the
world's largest developer ecosystem, which is a compelling argument for
future price growth.

### Keith Weiss, Morgan Stanley

###  ****

Morgan Stanley analyst[Keith Weiss][5] thinks the stock offers [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s
an opportunity and reiterated with his rating that the stock is a Buy
right now. He also took his target price up to $300, from $290. In a
research note, the analyst asserts that Microsoft's exposure to the
public cloud addressable market, collaboration, data, machine learning,
and security should all contribute to a positive financial outlook.

### Robert Majek, Raymond James

[Robert Majek][6] from Raymond James was impressed by Microsoft's
earnings, with the bulk of its outperformance coming from gaming and
Azure. He added that MSFT remained a tough stock to bet against while at
the same time maintaining his Strong Buy and raising his price target to
$290 from $275.

### Raimo Lenschow, Barclays

 ****

Last but not least, we share the future outlook for Microsoft by[Raimo
Lenschow][7]. The analyst maintains a Strong Buy rating while increasing
the target price from $269 to $288.

## Technical Analysis of Microsoft Corp.

What is the future of [Microsoft stocks][8] according to the technical
analysis? You can see on the chart that MSFT is going through a healthy
retrace. Still, this seems to match the previous bullish pattern, so an
upper breakout is possible.

MSFT could potentially slide further down into the bottom of the green
channel. But a price sitting between the 20/50MA or slightly below the
50MA could indicate an opportunity to enter (assuming you're bullish on
a stock).

The Microsoft stock projection is positive based on bullish divergence
with the TTM Squeeze indicator — the price moved higher, while the
indicator moved lower.

## Microsoft Stock Forecast for 2022

The MSFT forecast for 2022 sees the projected stock price moving from
the $279-$284 range to $329-$333. Such a positive start goes in line
with all of the bullish predictions for the previous year.

Microsoft has a significant share in the growing cloud business market.
By 2022, Gartner expects the public cloud services market to reach
$397.4 billion, up from $270 billion in 2020. Not to mention,
Microsoft's involvement in the Internet of Things industry could tap
into another prosperous territory — by 2022, IoT spending is expected to
exceed $1 trillion globally.

Microsoft's Azure will prove an important milestone next year. It is
predicted to replace the Office productivity suite as the company's
largest source of revenue. This will signify a successful transition
from on-premises software to cloud-based services, opening up more doors
for stock price growth.

## Microsoft Stock Forecast for 2023

Based on the [Microsoft][1] forecast for 2023, it appears the company
could continue to gain steam. Starting at $333-$339 per share, it could
reach $383-$387 by the end of the year. A steady upward move over the
next few years is exactly what long-term [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are looking for in
such a stock.

Microsoft reinvented how it works with partners and doesn't bat an
eyelid that its partners drive 95% of its commercial revenue.

As shared by Microsoft's One Commercial Partner Group, estimated growth
in the digital transformation market of up to $4.5 trillion by 2023
feels achievable. This will be driven by partners helping customers with
the migration to and hosting of cloud services.

Microsoft's current trend still revolves around partnerships with
software companies. As they bring their solutions to market, Microsoft's
standing in the cloud solution market will strengthen through 2023 and
beyond.

## Microsoft Stock Forecast for 2025 Through 2030

The 5-year forecast for the company looks as optimistic as all other
ones we've covered. A $50 rise over the year is unlikely to be
accompanied by explosive spikes. Based on [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) probability,
Microsoft should be consistent in 2025 price performance.

An interesting fact about Microsoft is that the company plans to become
carbon negative by 2030. Share prices of carbon-intensive companies tend
to be more sensitive to emissions-related [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/). And with public and
government pressure, it's a reasonable and possibly profitable decision
to turn to carbon reduction and removal technologies.

Another interesting social and regulatory pressure concerns wage
inflation and growing annual labor costs. The United States will face
the biggest "wage premium" in 2030, subjecting companies to
significantly increase workforce expenses. But for Microsoft
specifically, the costs will hardly make a dent in the company's
expected earnings or affect stock forecasts in any way.

## Timeline of Microsoft Price Changes in Recent History

To give our Microsoft stock forecast more context, let's look at its
price [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) over the last few years.

Justified by a 48% growth in revenues, [MSFT][1] price was steadily
rising from 2017 to the start of 2020. Revenue growth rose from $97
billion in 2017 to $143 billion in 2020. The stock price grew from
$62.64 (January 3, 2017) to $185.35 (February 10, 2020).

During this period, the company focused more on Cloud services, making
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s hopeful about the same trend continuing in the future.

Shares of Microsoft have alternated between outperformance and
underperformance over the past year. Why is [MSFT][1] stock down during
some periods? The answer will probably not surprise you.

When the [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) of the coronavirus outbreak and a rapid increase in new
cases broke out, the Microsoft stock price was impacted just like any
other financial asset. In a matter of a few weeks, the price fell from
$190.65 (February 11, 2020) to $135 (March 16).

 _Source:[Yahoo Finance][12]_

After a short lagging period, the stock started to outperform again. In
Q3 and Q4 2020, the company saw increased demand in cloud usage as
customers turned to remote working on a [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) basis. The demand for
Windows OEM, Surface, and Gaming drove the price first to $213.67 in
June and then to $228.91 in August.

In the same year, Microsoft surpassed its pre-Covid high of $190. The
most recent peak closed at $263.19 (April 27, 2021).
