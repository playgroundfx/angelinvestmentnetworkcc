Dollar pricks up its ears. Forecast as of 27.05.2021Dmitri Demidenko

Investors are focused on the speeches of the Fed’s and ECB’s officials.
US central bankers have changed the tone. How will it affect the
[EURUSD][1]? Let us discuss the Forex outlook and make up a trading
plan.

## Weekly US dollar fundamental forecast

If you want to understand the markets better and achieve success in
trading, learn to listen. Although FOMC officials continue to talk about
the temporary nature of the inflation surge, they have begun discussing
the term of tapering the QE. According to Fed Vice Chairman Randal
Quarles, __ _t_ he disappearance of the basic effects of PCE growth is
unlikely to press the inflation below the target at the end of 2021,
which makes the decision to taper the QE justified. The hawkish stance
of the Fed officials and the inability of [EURUSD][1] consolidated above
the important level of 1.226 made [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s exit the euro longs, sending
the pair back below the base of figure 22.

According to Bloomberg research, the main driver of the rise in
commodity prices, which further fuels inflation, is not the leading
growth of demand over supply, but a speculative factor. It is linked to
the stimulus policies of governments and central banks, and the longer
quantitative easing programs remain, the more difficult it will be for
the Fed and other regulators to curb inflation.

The central banks of Canada, Norway, and New Zealand understand this,
the Fed, of course, too, but the influence of the latter on financial
markets is so great that if Jerome Powell and his colleagues begin to
actively talk about the normalization of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), the taper
tantrum of 2013 will immediately surface. Therefore, the Fed is starting
to prepare [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s for tapering the QE from afar and, judging by the
stabilization of the [S&P 500][2] and Treasury yields, it is doing well.

The ECB is also aware of the harm of excessive monetary stimulus, but
the ECB officials prefer to avoid talks about reduction in the PEPP pace
for another reason. Unlike the USA, Canada, and Norway, the euro-area
inflation hasn’t reached the target, so [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s will not seriously
take the discussions about tapering the European QE. That is why the
member of the ECB Executive Board, Fabio Panetta, says that the euro-
area economy still relies on the oxygen provided by both monetary and
fiscal [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/); it is far from the point of self-sustained growth. Euro-
area bond yields were down, as well as the [EURUSD][1].

### Dynamics of bond yields in Germany and Italy

Germany can still afford the bond yields growth from a negative to a
zero level. However, the growth of Italian yields will press down the
economic recovery.

### Weekly [EURUSD][1] trading plan

I believe the speeches of the Fed’s and ECB’s officials could only
hinder the euro strengthening versus the dollar rather than turn down
the [EURUSD][1] uptrend. The euro bulls still find support in the global
economic recovery, Fed’s willingness to buy out the Treasuries, China,
Germany’s elections, and other factors suggesting the euro rally
continue. Therefore, if the euro goes down to $1.215, $1.212, and $1.208
and rebounds from the supports, it will be relevant to enter longs.
