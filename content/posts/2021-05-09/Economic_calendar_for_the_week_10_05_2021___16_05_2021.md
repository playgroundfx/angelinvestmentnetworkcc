Economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the week 10.05.2021 – 16.05.2021Jana Kane

##  **Review of the main events of the Forex economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the
next trading week (10.05.2021 – 16.05.2021)**

 **Trading on key Forex [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/): next week we expect the publication of
important macro statistics from Australia, China, the UK, Germany, the
United States, as well as speeches by the heads of the central banks of
the UK and Canada.**

The dollar fell sharply last Friday after the release of data from the
US labor market that did not meet the expectations. The country's Labor
Ministry reported that the number of non-farm jobs in April rose by
266,000 (forecast was +978,000), while unemployment, instead of the
expected decline, rose to 6.1% from 6% in March.

The expectations of the soon upcoming curtailing of the Fed's stimulus
program amid rapid improvement in economic data and rising inflation
have now declined significantly.

Obviously, the Fed's caution amid growing optimism in the economy was
justified.

President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis Neel Kashkari,
speaking on Bloomberg after Friday's employment report, noted that
planning for monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) should be based on evidence, not forecasts.

The DXY dollar index fell by 1.1% last week, thus declining to February
levels. At the same time, the American stock indices closed the last
week with another gain. Despite the weak data from the labor market,
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are optimistic about the prospects for the American economy,
and the weak report from the Ministry of Labor only adds to their
confidence that the leaders of the Fed, as promised earlier, will not
begin to curtail the stimulus program and will not start raising
interest rates before the end of 2023.

Next week, financial market participants will pay attention to the
publication of important macro statistics from Australia, China, the UK,
Germany, the United States, as well as to the speeches of the heads of
the central banks of the UK and Canada.

 **Traders should pay attention to the publication of the following
macro indicators:**

 ***during the coming week, new events may be added to the [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) and
/ or some scheduled events may be canceled**

 ****GMT time**

###  **Monday, May 10**

###  **01:30 AUD Retail Sales Index**

This indicator is published monthly by the Australian Bureau of
Statistics and estimates total retail sales. The index is often
considered an indicator of consumer confidence and reflects the health
of the retail sector in the near term. A rise in the index is usually
positive for the AUD; a decrease in the indicator will negatively affect
the AUD. The previous value of the index (for February) was -0.8%. If
the data turns out to be weaker than the previous value, the AUD may
sharply decline in the short term; if they are above the previous
values, the AUD is likely to strengthen. Forecast: +1.4% in March.

###  **Tuesday, May 11**

###  **01:30 CNY Consumer Price Index (CPI)**

The National Bureau of Statistics of China will release another monthly
data reflecting the dynamics of consumer prices in China. The rise in
consumer prices could trigger an acceleration in inflation, which could
force the People's Bank of China to take measures aimed at tightening
fiscal [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). Increased growth in consumer inflation may cause
appreciation of the yuan, while a weak result will put pressure on the
yuan.

China's economy, according to various estimates, is already the largest
in the world, pushing the US economy into second place. Therefore, the
publication of important macroeconomic indicators of this country has a
significant impact on world financial markets, primarily on the
positions of the yuan, other Asian currencies, the dollar, commodity
currencies, as well as on Chinese and Asian stock indices. China is the
largest buyer of raw materials and a supplier of a wide range of
finished products to the world commodity market.

In January 2021, the growth of the consumer inflation index was +1.0%
(-0.3% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)), and in February +0.6% (-0.2% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)).

Deterioration of macroeconomic indicators, including a decrease in
consumer inflation, may negatively affect the positions of the yuan, as
well as commodity currencies such as the Canadian, Australian, and New
Zealand dollars. To a greater extent, this concerns the Australian
dollar, since China is Australia's largest trade and economic partner.

According to the forecast, the consumer price index is expected to
decline in April by -0.2%, but an increase of +1.0% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/).

The growth of the consumer inflation index will positively affect the
quotes of the yuan, as well as commodity currencies, primarily the
Australian dollar. However, a relative decline in CPI may negatively
affect them.

###  **14:30 GBP Speech by Head of the Bank of England Andrew Bailey**

Financial market participants expect Andrew Bailey to clarify the
situation regarding the further [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the UK central bank.
Volatility during the speech of the head of the Bank of England usually
rises sharply in the quotes of the pound and the London Stock Exchange
FTSE index if he gives any hints of tightening or easing of the Bank of
England's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). Perhaps Andrew Bailey will also provide
clarification on the Bank of England's decision on the interest rate
last week and will touch on the state and prospects of the British
economy after Brexit and the partial lifting of quarantine restrictions
due to the coronavirus. If Bailey does not touch on monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
issues, the reaction to his speech will be weak.

###  **Wednesday, May 12**

###  **06:00 GBP UK GDP for Q1 (preliminary estimate)**

GDP is considered to be an indicator of the overall health of the
British economy. The upward trend in GDP is considered positive for the
GBP. The UK's GDP was one of the highest in the world until 2016, when
the Brexit referendum was held. In the future, its growth slowed down,
and with the onset of the global coronavirus pandemic, the growth rate
of the British GDP went into negative territory altogether.

The UK GDP is forecast to grow 0.5% in Q1 2021 (after falling -19.8% in
Q2 and rising + 1.3% in Q4 2020). The main factors that can force the
Bank of England to keep rates low are weak GDP and labor market growth,
as well as low consumer spending. If the GDP data turns out to be worse
than the forecast, it will put downward pressure on the pound. Strong
GDP report will strengthen the pound.

###  **06:00 EUR Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) in Germany
(final release)**

This index is published by the EU Statistical Office and is calculated
on the basis of a statistical method agreed between all EU countries. It
is an indicator for assessing inflation used by the Governing Council of
the ECB to assess the level of price stability. A positive result
strengthens the EUR, a negative one weakens it.

The preliminary estimate for April was: +2.1% (against +2.0% in March,
+1.6% in January and February, -0.7% in December and negative values
​​in the second half of 2020) in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/). If the data turn out to
be better than the forecast, the euro may strengthen in the short term.
The growth of the indicator is a positive factor for the euro. The data
indicate that inflation in Germany is accelerating, which is positive
for the euro. The data worse than the forecast and the previous value
will negatively affect the euro.

###  **09:00 GBP Speech by Head of the Bank of England Andrew Bailey**

Volatility during the speech of the head of the Bank of England usually
rises sharply in the quotes of the pound and the London Stock Exchange
FTSE index if he gives any hints of tightening or easing of the Bank of
England's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). Perhaps Andrew Bailey will also provide
clarification on the Bank of England's decision on the interest rate
last week and will touch on the state and prospects of the British
economy after Brexit and the partial lifting of quarantine restrictions
due to the coronavirus. If Bailey does not touch on monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
issues, the reaction to his speech will be weak.

###  **12:30 USD Consumer Price Index (excluding food and energy)**

Consumer Price Index (CPI) determines the change in prices of a selected
basket of goods and services for a given period and is a key indicator
for assessing inflation and changes in consumer preferences. Food and
energy have been excluded from this indicator to provide a more accurate
estimate. A high value strengthens the US dollar, while a value weakens
it. In March 2021, the value of the indicator was at +0.3% (+1.6% in
annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)). Forecast for April: +0.3% and +2.3% (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)),
which indicates some improvement in the situation after the fall of the
index in March and April 2020 amid the coronavirus pandemic. If the data
turns out to be weaker than the forecast, the dollar is likely to
respond with a short-term decline. Better-than-forecast data will
strengthen the dollar.

###  **Thursday, May 13**

In most European countries, banks will be closed for the celebration of
the Catholic Ascension Day. Trading volumes will be reduced.

###  **15:00 CAD Speech by Tiff Macklem, Governor of the Bank of
Canada**

The Canadian economy, as well as the entire global economy, slowed down
in 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic. Earlier, Tiff Macklem said that
the Canadian economy is quite stable. However, the situation has changed
rapidly, and not for the better. It will be interesting now to hear
Macklem's opinion on the sustainability of the Canadian economy and the
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the central bank.

If Macklem touches on the topic of the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the Bank of
Canada, the volatility in the quotes of the Canadian dollar will rise
sharply. His tough tone will help strengthen the Canadian dollar. The
soft rhetoric of Macklem's speech and the propensity for soft monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) will negatively affect the CAD quotes.

Probably, he can also provide some guidelines for [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s on the eve
of the next meeting of the Bank of Canada, which will be held on June 9.

###  **16:00 GBP Speech by Head of the Bank of England Andrew Bailey**

Volatility during the speech of the head of the Bank of England usually
rises sharply in the quotes of the pound and the London Stock Exchange
FTSE index if he gives any hints of tightening or easing of the Bank of
England's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). Perhaps Andrew Bailey will also provide
clarification on the Bank of England's decision on the interest rate
last week and will touch on the state and prospects of the British
economy after Brexit and the partial lifting of quarantine restrictions
due to the coronavirus. If Bailey does not touch on monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
issues, the reaction to his speech will be weak.

###  **12:30 USD Retail sales. Retail control group**

This report (Retail Sales) reflects the total sales of retailers of all
sizes and types. Changes in retail sales are the main indicator of
consumer spending. The report is a leading indicator, and in the future
the data may be greatly revised. A high result strengthens the US
dollar, a low one weakens it. A relative decrease in the indicator may
have a short-term negative impact on the dollar, while an increase in
the indicator will have a positive effect on the USD. In the previous
month (March), the indicator increased by +9.7% (after rising by +7.6%
in January and falling by -2.9% in February), which indicates that the
improvement in this sector of the American economy is still unstable
after partial lifting of strict quarantine restrictive measures in a
number of states. Outlook for April: +1.0%, which is likely to have a
positive effect on the USD if the forecast is confirmed.

Retail sales is the leading indicator of consumer spending in the United
States showing changes in retail sales. The Retail Control Group metric
measures volume across the entire retail industry and is used to
calculate price indices for most products. A strong result strengthens
the US dollar, and vice versa, a weak report weakens the dollar. A
slight increase in indicators is unlikely to accelerate the growth of
the dollar. The data worse than the values ​​of the previous period
(+6.9% in March, -3.5% in February, +8.7% in January) may negatively
affect the dollar in the short term. Forecast for April: +0.8%.

###  **14:00 USD University of Michigan Consumer Confidence Index
(preliminary release)**

This indicator reflects the confidence of American consumers in the
economic development of the country. A high level indicates economic
growth, while a low level indicates stagnation. Previous values ​​of the
indicator: 88.3 in April, 84.9 in March, 76.8 in February, 79.0 in
January 2021. An increase in the indicator will strengthen the USD,
while a decrease in the value will weaken the dollar. This indicator is
expected to be released in May with a value of 89.5. There is a steady
trend towards a gradual recovery in the growth of the indicator, which
is positive for the USD. The data worse than the forecast may negatively
affect the dollar in the short term.
