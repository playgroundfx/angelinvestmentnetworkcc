Litecoin Price Predictions: How It could go in 2021 and BeyondJana Kane

Litecoin was up by more than 140% in 2020, despite a recent drawdown
that reduced the asset to about $50 per LTC. The Litecoin price has been
through a lot from its launch – going up and down. Its price started at
about $3 per LTC and has gone through a number of bubble cycles or "alt
seasons."

These contributed to a significant rise in the price before a minor
correction occurred. These price corrections do nothing to counter
Litecoin's strong price trajectory. Long-term, the outlook suggests that
Litecoin's potential is extremely high. Eventually, Litecoin closed 2020
at $126.23 (on Coinmarketcap). Will the price of Litecoin go up this
year and in the years to come? Let's find out!

The article covers the following subjects:

## A Bit of Litecoin History

Litecoin ([LTC][1]) is a so-called digital peer-to-peer currency
integrated into open-source software. Technically, the Litecoin project
is very similar to the Bitcoin system. Litecoin production and
transmission are based on an open-source encryption protocol. There is
no central control. With this in mind, all transactions, balances, and
expenses are managed by a peer-to-peer network. Litecoin is created on
the basis of a cryptological hash function, which in turn generates
blocks. Litecoin can be exchanged for Bitcoin and fiat money. The
processing in question usually takes place via online exchanges
([cryptocurrency exchange](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/best-cryptocurrency-exchange/)s).

Litecoin was created by a former Google employee, Charlie Lee, in 2011.
The cryptocurrency was created based on the Bitcoin protocol but differs
in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of the hash algorithm used. Furthermore, it also differs in
hard caps, block transaction times, and some other factors. Litecoin was
released via an open-source client on GitHub on October 7, 2011. On
October 13, 2011, 5 days later, the Litecoin network went live.

Lee's goal was to create a light version of Bitcoin with Litecoin.
Developers have always stated that you can consider Litecoin to be the
silver version of Bitcoin. Litecoin differs from Bitcoin in the
prioritization of the transaction confirmation rate, which is
approximately 2.5 minutes per block. However, the reality is that
Litecoin users will have to wait up to about 30 minutes for their
transaction to be processed due to network congestion.

## Why Is Litecoin an Attractive Investment Asset?

Litecoin is especially faster at handling payments than Bitcoin and is
an excellent, proven complementary alternative. It's a very cheap,
super-safe highway for making payments - especially when it comes to
micro-transactions, like, for example, when paying for a cup of coffee.
In addition, the Litecoin community is working on the implementation of
all kinds of new fintech gadgets that are actually intended for Bitcoin.
Litecoin is now working on the implementation of the lightning network
protocol and applications for [smart contract](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/smart-contract-on-blockchain/)s and privacy (including
confidential transactions & MimbleWimble). Litecoin is certainly light
and cheap, but above all in good hands with fantastic ambitions.
Litecoin has a bright future as a classic and reliable altcoin.

Most [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s see Bitcoin as gold and Litecoin as silver. Litecoin was
developed as an alternative to Bitcoin and developed as a lightweight
that solved some shortcomings of Bitcoin. It is a classic altcoin with
more than 6 years of experience and development behind it. Software
updates and new tech can be easily added to Litecoin.

As with Bitcoin, there is also a built-in scarcity. In total, only 84
million Litecoin can be mined. Litecoin can be considered a much cheaper
and faster alternative. In fact, Litecoin is underestimated relative to
other cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is slower and more expensive to use
compared to Litecoin.

The fact that Litecoin is fast and cheap has advantages, especially
since people in third world countries without bank accounts can still
get Litecoin cheaply and quickly. Litecoin is a superior alternative to
fiat money when compared to Ethereum. Ethereum was not developed as
money, but it can certainly be used as such. You could rather consider
Ethereum to be crypto gas.

In addition, Ethereum is a much more difficult concept to grasp than
Litecoin. Litecoin is just digital p2p money with a built-in scarcity
that actually works faster as a transaction medium. This makes adoption
much easier and does not require much knowledge. Simply install the
wallet app on your smartphone, and you will have your own Swiss Litecoin
bank account with which you can actually conduct transactions almost
immediately. As the popularity and price of Bitcoin increase and,
therefore, the transaction costs rise, cheaper and faster alternatives
will be sought. This is Litecoin, baby.

## Other Interesting Facts

Litecoin has made a lot of progress and has even been included as a
means of payment in Venezuela's mainstream international payments
system. Via the Remesas remittance platform, foreigners can send
Litecoin to family members and friends in Venezuela who receive Bolivars
in their local bank account through Remesas. A commission of 15% is
charged, which means that the government in Venezuela secretly collects
Litecoin.

Another interesting fact is that the Litecoin Foundation has a 9.9%
share in the German WEG bank. The Litecoin Foundation has received this
as a donation from the Swiss [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) company TokenPay. Together they
have almost a 20% share in this conservative German bank, mainly for
real estate [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s. Litecoin can thus be recognized in the long-term
as a possible cryptocurrency for buying real estate in Germany? But we
digress, so let's not dive too deep into the matter and see how the coin
develops.

## Litecoin Price Analysis

Despite it not being a bullish period for cryptocurrencies until around
October 2020, Litecoin has performed reasonably well compared to its
competitors. Charlie Lee is clearly doing really well; he finally
introduced confidential transactions (CT). Like the privacy coins ZCash
and Monero, LTC’s confidential transactions will prevent replaceability,
scalability, and privacy issues.

 The acceptance rate is also quite high. Very recently, the Litecoin
logo was even advertised on the UFC mat during a famous fight. It was a
real eye-catcher. Furthermore, a new shopping center in Singapore with
an ATM that accepts both Bitcoin and Litecoin has been installed.
Litecoin's price prediction is very optimistic in the opinion of
experts.

Experts expect Litecoin to have a bright future in 2021 due to all
integrations and partnerships. In addition, the Litecoin community is
very active, with all the upcoming developments. They will, of course,
keep the enthusiasts informed. Litecoin clearly has the potential to
rise further and is certainly a tough competitor for the other cryptos.

If Litecoin can break above its current price and hold on in the long-
run, the Litecoin forecast says it will finally retest its all-time
high. The maximum height for the Litecoin /US dollar rate is likely to
remain below $300 for much of the next year. What will Litecoin do in
the next 5 years?

## Litecoin Price Predictions by Crypto Experts

The cryptocurrency market is very volatile, which means that predicting
reliable prices of cryptocurrencies is indeed one of the most difficult
things to do. Let’s have a look at some recent expert publications
regarding their statement and LTC prediction. They may give us food for
thought about LTC:

### Trading Beasts

A technical analysis performed by Trading Beasts predicted that by the
end of 2020, LTC might reach around $47 and that it is good for
investment in the long run. We now know that LTC closed December 31st,
2020, at $126.23 (on Coinmarketcap). That’s quite higher than predicted!

### Wallet Investor

Wallet Investor always has been frank and conservative in predicting all
cryptocurrencies. They have again come out with a conservative
prediction for Litecoin, where they stated that LTC might reach $22.95
by the end of last year. We guess no one expected the BTC boom! Shh. We
didn’t either.

### Long Forecast

According to a published Long Forecast research, the price of Litecoin
should have reached $55 by the end of 2020. Their forecast was a bit
more optimistic than the previous two, but still, they underestimated
the power of Litecoin.

### CoinPrice

Finally, someone who believed in LTC! CoinPrice predicted that Litecoin
might reach as high as $124 by 2020. As we have seen from the previous
expert outlets, this was quite an optimistic prediction, but they stood
by it and were the most accurate of them all! Nice work on that
analysis, CoinPrice!

## Litecoin Technical Analysis

Lately, Litecoin has been following a flag pattern. After reaching $160
on January 3rd, the cryptocurrency had two bearish days and dipped down
to about $150. Let’s look at what’s happening behind the scenes.

LTC followed three flag patterns consecutively, which doubled its price
from $80 to $160. If Litecoin fulfills flag and pole post-consolidation,
its price could reach $185. If the RSI breaks below the overbought zone,
however, its price will go down.

As seen in the 4-hour chart below, the MACD switched from bullish to
bearish, as did the [Parabolic SAR](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/parabolic-sar.html). This shows that, currently, there is
a negative market trend and that there is an expected drop further.
Thus, the 20-period SMA is critical in holding up the price.

There is a lack of strong resistance barriers – thus, LTC’s price has
enough space to fulfill the flag pattern. When we take a look at the
IOMAP (in/out of the money around price), we can see that LTC has a
positive future.

## Litecoin Price Prediction: 2022 -2023

The LTC price prediction is performed based on the fact that it is the
5th most appreciated cryptocurrency in the world. With its low
transaction costs and fast confirmations, LTC is really becoming the new
global payment standard for consumers and businesses worldwide. Litecoin
also reassures traders that costs are likely lower than they thought.
The processing fees are far less than those incurred by credit cards and
other forms of payments. Even the integration is free!

As Litecoin is steadily gaining more popularity, the acceptance ratio
might also increase. It is already high compared to the other newcomers.
We predict that the price is going to climb pretty high in the years
2022 and 2023, when it may have the power to reach the 900 dollar mark.

## Long Term Litecoin Price Prediction: 2025-2030

The third halving for Litecoin is set to take place in 2023. In doing
so, block rewards would be halved to 6.25 LTC. This incites Litecoin
enthusiasts to trade and invest as the halving process causes the
currency to appreciate in value. Litecoin could even excel above its
competitors to become one of the most traded cryptocurrencies.

As such, the prediction for Litecoin by 2025-2030 is that its value
could reach $1200. Keep in mind that such long-term price forecasts are
indicative in nature. Forecasts for such a long time are very
approximate.

## How Has the Price of Litecoin Changed Over Time?

Today, LTC is trading at $127.96. On the current CoinMarketCap [ranking](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/crypto-exchange-ranking/)s,
Litecoin ranks #5, with a market cap of $9,957,064,586 (January 3rd,
2021). The circulating supply is 66,230,155 LTC, while the maximum stock
is 84,000,000 LTC coins. The Litecoin price hit its all-time high of
$375.29 on December 19, 2017. But in order to make the most reliable
cryptocurrency predictions, it's important not just to look ahead but
also to look back at the previous price performance of Litecoin. Below
you'll see how Litecoin performed over the years of its existence:



## Is Litecoin a Good Investment?

The [Litecoin][1] price should remain a sought-after asset for the
coming year as well. In the past three months alone, the currency is up
120 percent. Even if short-term gains remain likely, the price should
target its 2019 high, around $145, in the medium and long term. Only
when the said high has been successfully reached do I see further upside
potential.

The coronavirus pandemic is likely to remain at the heart of the markets
in 2021. In response to the massive support of central bankers from the
world's major central banks, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are increasingly looking for a
hedge to counter value risk. Against this backdrop, Litecoin, Bitcoin,
and other top cryptocurrencies are likely to continue to attract
attention.

If Litecoin can break above its current price and hold on in the long-
run, the Litecoin forecast says it will finally retest its all-time
high. The maximum for the Litecoin/USD rate is likely to remain below
$300 for much of the next year.
