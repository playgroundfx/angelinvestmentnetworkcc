Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 11.01.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

The Ripple seems to have finished the downtrend, and there is forming
the beginning of an uptrend.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

The BTCUSD market is forming the bullish impulse 5, namely, its final
leg. There is now developing the impulse sub-wave [5] composed of the
sub-waves (1)-(2)-(3)-(4)-(5). The first four elements of the wave [5]
have completed, and there is forming the final impulse (5). The market
may have finished forming the bearish correction (4) that is an element
of the third impulse wave. Therefore, the price should continue rising
in wave (5). An approximate trajectory of the Bitcoin future price trend
is outlined in the chart.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 35603.00 TP 50000.00

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

The XRPUSD market completed the large down triple zigzag. Next, the
price turned up and started forming a new uptrend. There should be
developing wave (1) that is likely to be a leading diagonal because the
end of correction 4 is higher than the end of wave 1. The market should
be running up in wave 5 to a level of 0.460 in the next few days, as it
is outlined in the chart.

### Trading plan for **[XRPUSD][2]** today:

Buy 0.278, TP 0.460

## Elliott wave Ethereum analysis

The ETHUSD market continues rising in the bullish impulse wave C. There
is currently developing the final sub-wave [5] that has completed four
sub-waves out of five. The market seems to have completed the upward
impulse 3; next, the price went down in correction 4, which may also
have completed. Therefore, the Ethereum price should be rising in the
impulse wave 5 to a level of 1580.00

### Trading plan for  **[ETHUSD][3] **today:

Buy 1108.45, TP 1580.00
