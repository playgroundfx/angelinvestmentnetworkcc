GBP/USD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 19/06/2020 –
26/06/2020Alex Geuta

## [GBP/USD][1] is correcting, still likely to grow. Estimated pivot
point is at a level of 1.2350.

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions above the level of 1.2350
with a target of  1.2880 – 1.3150 once the correction has finished.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
1.2350 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of 1.2069
– 1.1635.

 **Analysis:** Supposedly, the fifth wave of larger degree V finished
developing on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame, with wave  (С) of V completed and
the first wave (1) developing inside. On the H4 time frame, wave 1 of
(1) formed, a local correction is completed in the form of wave 2 of
(1), and wave 3 of (1) started developing. Apparently, the first wave of
smaller degree  i of 3 has formed on the H1 time frame and a local
correction is nearing completion in the form of wave ii of 3. If the
presumption is correct, the pair will continue to rise to the levels of
1.2880 – 1.3150. The level of 1.2350 is critical in this scenario as the
breakout will enable the pair to continue declining to the levels of
1.2069 – 1.1635.
