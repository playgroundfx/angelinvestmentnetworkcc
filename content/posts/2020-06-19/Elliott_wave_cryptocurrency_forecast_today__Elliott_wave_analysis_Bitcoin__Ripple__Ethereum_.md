## Elliott wave forecast for BTCUSD, ETHUSD, XRPUSD for today

###  **Elliott wave[BTCUSD][1] analysis**

 **![LiteForex: Elliott wave cryptocurrency forecast today. Elliott wave
analysis Bitcoin, Ripple, Ethereum.][2]**

There is developing the global upward wave A that is a five-wave
impulse. Four out five parts of this impulse have completed. Corrective
wave [4] is a skewed triangle (A)-(B)-(C)-(D)-(E), as its lines are
directed as the major trend. Next, the market is likely to have formed
the first two small waves (1) and (2) that are the elements of the final
impulse wave [5]. The price should be rising in the near future in sub-
waves (3)-(4)-(5) to a level of 10800.

###  **Elliott wave[XRPUSD][3] analysis**

 **![LiteForex: Elliott wave cryptocurrency forecast today. Elliott wave

The XRPUSD market is forming the global upward plain zigzag (A)-(B)-(C),
where the (B) correction has recently completed as a bearish double
zigzag. Currently, there is likely to be developing a new bullish trend
that may be an impulse. Presumably, two small sub-waves (1) and (2) have
completed, so the price should be rising in the third wave over the next
few days.

###  **Elliott wave[ETHUSD][5] analysis**

The ETHUSD market is developing the upward impulse wave A. The first
four parts of this wave have completed, and the final upward wave [5] is
now developing. There is likely to have completed the corrective wave
(4) as a bearish zigzag. Now, the market is moving up in the initial
phase of impulse (5). The price could be rising to a level of 263.00. An
approximate trajectory of the Ethereum future price movement is outline
in the chart.
