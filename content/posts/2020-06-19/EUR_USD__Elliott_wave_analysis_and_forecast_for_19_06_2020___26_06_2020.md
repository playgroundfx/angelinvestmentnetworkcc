EUR/USD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 19/06/2020 –
26/06/2020Alex Geuta

## [EUR/USD][1] is correcting, still likely to grow. Estimated pivot
point is at a level of 1.1096.

 **Main scenario:** long positions should be considered above the level
of 1.1096 with a target of 1.1495 – 1.1605 once the correction has
formed.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
1.1096 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of 1.1019
– 1.0769.

 **Analysis:** Supposedly, a descending correction of larger degree
finished developing on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame in the form of wave 2 and
the third wave 3 started developing. On the H4 time frame the first
counter-trend wave 1 of (3) is forming, with wave iii of 1 forming
inside. On the H1 time frame, apparently, the third wave of smaller
degree (iii) of iii of 1 formed and a local correction is developing in
the form of wave (iv) of iii of 1. If the presumption is correct, after
correction, the pair will continue to rise to the levels of 1.1495 –
1.1605. The level of 1.1096 is critical in this scenario. Its breakout
will allow the pair to continue falling to the levels of 1.1019 –
1.0769.
