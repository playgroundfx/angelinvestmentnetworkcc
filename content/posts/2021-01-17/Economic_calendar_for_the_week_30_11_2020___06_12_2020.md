Economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the week 30.11.2020 – 06.12.2020Jana Kane

##  **Review of the main events of the Forex economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the
next trading week (18.01.2021 – 24.01.2021)**

 **Trading on key Forex [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/): next week we are expecting the publication
of important macro statistics from Australia, China, US, Germany,
Eurozone, Great Britain, Canada, New Zealand, as well as the results of
the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) meetings of the central banks of Japan, Eurozone,
Canada, and China**.

The statements of the head of the Fed Jerome Powell on maintaining low
interest rates for a long period of time made last Thursday put pressure
on the dollar, albeit only in the short term. Powell said it was too
early to talk about a revision of the central bank's soft [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/),
including a $120 billion a month bond buyback program. "The economy is
far from our goals," Powell explained.

Last Friday, the dollar resumed its growth, and the DXY dollar index
rose by about 0.5% by the end of the week to the level of 90.70.

The dollar, in particular, is receiving support from the growing yields
on US government bonds and from the sell-off on the US stock market.
Gold and oil quotes also declined last week, and gold continued with the
fall that began the previous week.

Investors continue to withdraw from defensive assets. But where are they
investing the money since the market for risky assets is also showing a
decline? Is it really the dollar? If so, then perhaps a turning point in
the negative dynamics of the dollar is coming right now.

Powell tried to reassure [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s, but how long will that last?

It is also possible that the fears of the continuing expansion of the
coronavirus pandemic contribute to the strengthening of the dollar. In
China, the growth in the number of new cases has reached a 10-month
high, not to mention the difficult situation in the UK and Europe
introducing new lockdowns.

Next week, financial market participants will pay attention to the
publication of important macro statistics from Australia, China, US,
Germany, Eurozone, Great Britain, Canada, New Zealand, as well as the
results of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) meetings of the central banks of Japan,
Eurozone, Canada, and China.

 **Traders should pay attention to the publication of the following
macro indicators:**

 ***during the coming week, new events may be added to the [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) and
/ or some scheduled events may be canceled**

 ****GMT time**

###  **Понедельник 18 Января**

In the United States, banks and exchanges are closed for the Martin
Luther King Jr. Day. Trading volumes during the American trading session
will be low.

###  **02:00 CNY China's GDP for the 4th quarter**

The National Bureau of Statistics of China will present data on GDP
growth in the 4th quarter.

In the 2nd quarter, China's GDP grew by +11.5% (+3.2% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)),
in the 3rd - by 2.7% (+4.9%, respectively), after a decrease of -6.8%
(-9.8% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) in the 1st quarter.

China's GDP is expected to grow by +3.2% (+6.1% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) in the
4th quarter of 2020.

China is the largest buyer of raw materials and a supplier of the widest
range of finished goods to the world commodity market. According to some
reports, China is already the first economy in the world, pushing the
American economy to second place. Therefore, the publication of
important macroeconomic indicators from China can have a strong impact
on the entire financial market.

The relative decline in GDP may negatively affect the yuan quotes, as
well as the quotes of commodity currencies and currencies of the Asia-
Pacific region, since it may indicate a slowdown in the growth rate of
the Chinese economy.

The growth of the indicator will have a positive effect on the Chinese
yuan, as well as on the world stock indices, primarily Asian ones, as
well as on the quotes of commodity currencies such as the New Zealand
and Australian dollars. China is the largest trade and economic partner
of Australia and New Zealand and a buyer of commodities from these
countries.

Therefore, positive macro statistics from China may also have a positive
effect on the quotes of these commodity currencies.

###  **02:00 CNY Retail Sales Index**

This index is published monthly by the National Bureau of Statistics of
China and measures total retail sales and cash receipts. The index is
often considered an indicator of consumer confidence and economic well-
being and reflects the health of the retail sector in the near term. A
rise in the index is usually positive for the CNY; a decrease in the
indicator will negatively affect the CNY. The previous value of the
index (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) was +5.0% (after an increase of +8% in the last
months of 2019 and a fall of -20.5% in February 2020). Forecast: In
December, retail sales in China rose by +5.5% (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)), which
speaks of an intensifying recovery after a strong fall in February-March
this year. If the data turns out to be even better, the CNY will
strengthen even more.

###  **Tuesday, January 19**

###  **07:00 EUR Harmonized Consumer Price Index (HICP) in Germany
(final release)**

This index is published by the EU Statistics Office and is calculated on
the basis of a statistical method agreed between all EU countries. It is
an indicator for assessing inflation used by the Governing Council of
the ECB to assess the level of price stability. A positive result
strengthens the EUR, a negative one weakens it. In May, the HICP index
(in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) increased by +0.5%, in June by +0.8%, in July - by 0%,
and in September it decreased by -0.5%. Forecast for December: -0.7%.

Since this is the second, final estimate, which coincides with the first
estimate (-0.7%), the euro is unlikely to strongly react to the
publication of this indicator. If the data turn out to be better than
the forecast, then the euro may strengthen in the short term. The growth
of the indicator is a positive factor for the euro. The data suggests
that inflationary pressures are still low in Germany. The data worse
than the forecast and the previous value will negatively affect the
euro.

###  **09:00 EUR Euro Area Bank Lending Survey**

The survey by EU financial experts on the state of the bank lending
system is carried out 4 times a year. The main goal of the survey is to
obtain expanded information on the conditions of bank lending in the
Eurozone.

The data obtained are used by the ECB management when making decisions
on the bank's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). This report may cause increased
volatility in the euro quotes and on the European stock market at the
time of its publication if it contains unexpected conclusions regarding
the [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of lending to businesses and households in the Eurozone.

###  **Wednesday, January 20**

###  **01:30 CNY The People's Bank of China's decision on the interest
rate**

Since May 2012, the People's Bank of China has been steadily cutting
interest rates in support of Chinese manufacturers. The last time in
2020 the bank cut the rate in April (by 0.20% to 3.85% at the moment).

In 2020, amid international trade conflicts and a slowdown in the global
economy, the world's largest central banks took the path of easing their
monetary policies in order to support national economies and increase
the competitiveness of goods exported from these countries.

The People's Bank of China is also in line with this process. The
depreciation of the yuan became especially relevant in the last 2 years,
when the confrontation between the two most powerful economies in the
world began. One of the measures to mitigate the negative consequences
of increased duties on the import of Chinese goods into the United
States was the depreciation of the national currency of China. This
measure was intended, among other things, to maintain the same volumes
of imports of Chinese products to the United States, which would cost
American buyers less due to the difference in the rates of the national
currencies of the United States and China.

Now another strong negative factor has been added to this - the
coronavirus pandemic.

Probably, at this meeting, the People's Bank of China will keep the
interest rate at the same level of 3.85%, although a rate cut is also
possible.

However, if the People's Bank of China makes unexpected statements or
decisions,  volatility may increase throughout the financial market.
Investors will also be interested in the bank's assessment of the
consequences of the coronavirus pandemic for the Chinese economy and its
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) in the near future in this regard.

###  **07:00 GBP Consumer price index. Core consumer price index**

Consumer price index (CPI) reflects the dynamics of retail prices for a
group of goods and services that make up the British consumer basket.
The CPI is a key indicator of inflation. Its publication causes active
movement of the pound in the foreign exchange market, as well as the
FTSE100 index on the London stock exchange.

In the previous reporting month (November), the growth of consumer
inflation (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) amounted to +0.3%.

Forecast for December: +0.5% (annualized). This value is unlikely to
provide significant support to the pound. The indicator value below the
forecast could provoke a weakening of the pound, as low inflation will
force the Bank of England to adhere to a soft monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).

Core Consumer Price Index is published by the Office for National
Statistics and determines the price change of a selected basket of goods
and services (excluding food and energy) for a given period. It is a key
indicator for assessing inflation and changes in purchasing preferences.
A positive result strengthens the GBP, a negative result weakens it.

In September, Core CPI (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) increased by +1.3%, in October
- by +1.5%, in November - by +1.1%. The publication of the indicator is
likely to have a positive effect on the pound if its value is higher
than the forecast and the previous value. Forecast for December: +1.3%
(annualized). The indicator reading below the forecast and previous
values ​​may provoke a weakening of the pound.

###  **13:30 CAD Consumer price indices in Canada**

Core Consumer Price Index (Core CPI) from the Bank of Canada reflects
the dynamics of the retail prices of the corresponding basket of goods
and services (excluding fruits, vegetables, gasoline, fuel oil, natural
gas, mortgage interest, intercity transportation, and tobacco products).
The target inflation rate for the Bank of Canada is in the range of
1-3%. The rise in CPI is a harbinger of a rate hike and a positive
factor for the CAD. Core CPI rose in November by +1.5%, in October and
September by +1.0% (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)). If the data for December turns out
to be worse than the previous values, it will negatively affect the CAD.
The data better than the previous values will strengthen the Canadian
dollar.

###  **15:00 CAD Bank of Canada's decision on interest rate. Bank of
Canada's accompanying statement. Bank of Canada's Monetary Policy
Committee Report**

The Bank of Canada will decide on the interest rate. In March, the bank
lowered the rate 3 times, bringing it to the level of 0.25%, to mitigate
the economic damage from the novel coronavirus pandemic.

In an accompanying statement, the central bank of Canada said that the
decision "aims to support the financial system, which plays a central
role in lending to the economy, as well as to create a foundation that
will allow the economy to return to normal." The central bank also said
in a press release that the spread of the coronavirus and the plummeting
global oil prices combined are weighing heavily on Canadians and the
Canadian economy.

In fact, quantitative easing and a significant cut in the interest rate
should help weaken the national currency.

The impact of the coronavirus on the Canadian economy and the country's
labor market (in March, unemployment rose to 7.8% from 5.6% in February,
and the number of employed, as reported by Statistics Canada, fell by
1.01 million), as well as weak housing market put pressure on the Bank
of Canada towards further easing of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).

However, the Bank of Canada is expected to keep its interest rate at
0.25% at its meeting on Wednesday.

Tough tone of the accompanying statement by the Bank of Canada on rising
inflation and the prospects for further tightening of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
will cause the Canadian dollar to strengthen. If the Bank of Canada
signals the need for a soft monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), the Canadian currency will
decline.

###  **16:15 CAD Press conference of the Bank of Canada**

During the press conference, the head of the Bank of Canada Tiff Macklem
will explain the bank's position and assess the current economic
situation in the country. If the tone of his speech is tough on the
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the Bank of Canada, the Canadian dollar will
strengthen in the foreign exchange market. If Macklem speaks out for
maintaining a soft monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), the Canadian currency will decline.
In any case, during his speech, high volatility in the CAD quotes is
expected.

###  **Thursday, January 21**

###  **00:30 AUD Employment rate. Unemployment rate**

The employment rate reflects the monthly change in the number of
Australian citizens employed. The growth of the indicator has a positive
impact on consumer spending, which stimulates economic growth. A high
value is positive for the AUD, while a low value is negative. Forecast:
in December, the number of employed Australian citizens increased by
50,000 (after falling by 607,400 in April, by 264,100 in May and by
90,000 in November).

Also at the same time, the Australian Bureau of Statistics will publish
a report on the unemployment rate - an indicator that estimates the
ratio of the unemployed population to the total number of able-bodied
citizens. The growth of the indicator indicates the weakness of the
labor market, which leads to a weakening of the national economy. The
decline in the indicator is a positive factor for the AUD. Forecast:
unemployment in Australia in December was at 6.7% (against 6.8% in
November, 7.0% in October, 6.9% in September, 6.8% in August, 7.5% in
July , 7.4% in June, 5.2% in March, 5.1% in February). In general, the
indicators are still not positive. However, in other large economies,
the labor market has deteriorated on an even larger scale due to the
coronavirus.

The leaders of the RBA have repeatedly stated that, in addition to the
situation in international trade, the Australian economy and the central
bank's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) plans are influenced by the indicators of the
level of household debt and expenditures, the growth of workers'
salaries, as well as the state of the country's labor market.

In November 2020, the RB of Australia cut its key interest rate by
another 0.15% to a new all-time low of 0.1% due to the coronavirus. In
the opinion of the RBA management, an unemployment rate of 4.5% or lower
is required to raise wages and accelerate inflation to the target range.
Unemployment in the country is not declining, and a return of inflation
to the middle of the target range of 2-3% is not even in the distant
horizon.

The AUD is unlikely to react positively to the publication of data from
the country's labor market. If the values ​​of the indicators turn out
to be worse than forecast,  the Australian dollar may significantly
decline in the short term. Better-than-expected data will strengthen AUD
in the short term.

###  **03:00 JPY Bank of Japan's decision on interest rate. Bank of
Japan's press conference and comments on monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)**

The Bank of Japan will decide on the interest rate. At the moment, the
main rate in Japan is in negative territory, amounting to -0.1%. Most
likely, the rate will remain the same. If it is cut and deepens into
negative territory, such a decision will cause a sharp decline in the
yen in the foreign exchange market and an increase in the Japanese stock
market. In any case, during this period of time, a jump in volatility is
expected in trading in the yen and in the Asian financial market.

Since February 2016, the Bank of Japan has kept the deposit rate at
-0.1%. The target yield for 10-year bonds is currently around 0%. In
2020, the Bank of Japan set an annual target for [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/) purchases of 12
trillion yen and expanded its coronavirus-affected business aid program
to 110 trillion yen from 75 trillion yen. Under this program, companies
can obtain loans without collateral and at zero interest rates. The goal
of the program is to support commercial companies whose bankruptcy rates
have skyrocketed in Japan in recent months due to the coronavirus
pandemic. A recent accompanying statement from the Bank of Japan said
that the bank's management will continue to "increase the monetary base
until inflation stays above 2%." “We will not hesitate to take
additional mitigation measures if necessary,” the bank also
traditionally said in a statement.

During the press conference, the head of the Bank of Japan Haruhiko
Kuroda will comment on the bank's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). The Bank of Japan
continues to adhere to its super-soft monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). As Kuroda has
stated on several occasions, "it is appropriate for Japan to patiently
continue with its current loose monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)." Markets usually react
noticeably to Kuroda's speeches. He will probably again touch upon the
topic of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) during his speech, which will cause an increase
in volatility not only in the yen trade, but also throughout the Asian
and global financial markets.

If the bank's executives decide that the Japanese economy is stable and
the momentum of inflation towards the 2% target is not diminishing, they
will refrain from changing [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).

###  **06:00 JPY Bank of Japan Press Conference**

During the press conference, the head of the Bank of Japan Haruhiko
Kuroda will comment on the bank's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). Despite the measures
taken earlier by the bank to stimulate the Japanese economy, inflation
remains low, production and consumption are falling, which negatively
affects export-oriented Japanese producers. Markets usually react
noticeably to Kuroda's speeches. If he touches on the topic of monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) during his speech, volatility will increase not only in the yen
trade, but throughout the Asian and global financial markets.

###  **12:45** **EUR ECB's rate decision**

The ECB will publish its decision on the key rate and on the deposit
rate. The ECB's tough stance on inflation and key interest rates
contributes to the strengthening of the euro, while the soft stance and
rate cuts weaken the euro. In September 2019, the European Central Bank
lowered its key interest rate on deposits by 0.1% to -0.5% for the first
time since March 2016 and began buying bonds worth 20 billion euros a
month, renewing the so-called quantitative easing program. According to
the ECB leaders, the balance of risks for the economic prospects of the
Eurozone "is still shifted to the negative side", and "until inflation
is in line" with the target level, which is just below 2%, the rate will
remain low. Now inflation in the Eurozone is stubbornly holding around
1%, and the new forecasts of the ECB on rates and the QE program can be
seen as a signal of the inclination to further soften [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).

Besides Brexit, trade conflicts, factors of political instability in
Europe, as well as the growing coronavirus pandemic, due to which
European countries are forced to impose new quarantine restrictions that
negatively affect economic activity, are the main threats to the
European economy. Back in March 2020, the ECB signaled the possibility
of [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) easing, and the bank's representative admitted that the bank's
management could lower the already negative interest rates even more.

Probably, following the results of this ECB meeting, the key interest
rate will remain at the same level of 0%. The ECB's rate on deposits for
commercial banks is also likely to remain at -0.5%. At the same time,
there is a possibility that at this meeting the ECB will announce a new
economic stimulus program, which will put pressure on the euro.

###  **13:30 EUR Press conference of the ECB**

During the press conference, a surge in volatility is possible not only
in the euro quotes, but also in the entire financial market if the ECB
leaders make an unexpected statement. Similar previous decisions by the
ECB on interest rates and subsequent press conferences have moved the
euro rate by 3-5% in a short time. The ECB leaders will assess the
current economic situation in the Eurozone and comment on the ECB's rate
decision.

The soft tone of the statements will have a negative impact on the euro.
Conversely, the tough tone of the ECB leaders on the central bank's
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) will strengthen the euro.

###  **21:45 NZD CPI (Consumer Price Index) for the 4th quarter**

Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a key indicator for assessing inflation
that reflects the dynamics of retail prices for a group of goods and
services that make up the consumer basket. A positive result strengthens
the NZD, a negative one weakens it. Previous CPI values (YoY): +1.4% in
Q3, +1.5% in Q2, +2.5% in Q1 2020. A relative decrease in the indicator
may negatively affect the NZD quotes.

###  **Friday, January 22**

###  **00:30 AUD Retail Sales Index**

Retail Sales Index is published monthly by the Australian Bureau of
Statistics and measures total retail sales. The index is often
considered an indicator of consumer confidence and reflects the health
of the retail sector in the near term. Index growth is usually positive
for the AUD; a decrease in the indicator will negatively affect the AUD.
The previous value of the index (in November) was +7.1% after falling by
-17.7% in April. If the data for December turns out to be weaker than
the previous value,  the AUD may sharply decline in the short term. If
the data turns out to be higher than previous values, the AUD is likely
to strengthen.

###  **08:30 EUR Germany's Manufacturing PMI by Markit Economics
(preliminary release). Composite PMI by Markit Economics (preliminary
release)**

Germany's Manufacturing PMI is an important indicator of the business
environment and the overall health of the German economy. This sector of
the economy forms a significant part of Germany's GDP. A result above 50
is considered positive and strengthens the EUR, one below 50 - as
negative for the euro. Forecast for January (preliminary release): 58.0.
Previous values ​​of 58.3 in December, 57.8 in November, 58.2 in October
against 34.5 in April, 45.4 in March, 48 in February, 45.3 in January
indicate an acceleration of business activity in this sector of the
German economy after slowing down in early 2020. The growth of the
indicator above 50 and the previous value is likely to support the euro
(in the short term). The data worse than the forecast and especially the
value of 50 will have a negative impact on the euro.

Composite PMI is an important indicator of the business environment and
the overall health of the German economy. A result above 50 is
considered positive and strengthens the EUR, one below 50 - as negative
for the euro. Forecast for January (preliminary release): 50.4 against
52.0 in December, 51.2 in November, 55 in October against 17.4 in April,
35 in March, 50.7 in February, indicating continued recovery the German
economy after its fall in early 2020, albeit at a slower pace. The
publication of this indicator with the specified expected value is
likely to support the euro. The data worse than the forecast and below
the value of 50.0, as a rule, have a negative impact on the euro.

###  **09:00 EUR Composite Manufacturing PMI by Markit Economics
(preliminary release)**

Eurozone's Manufacturing PMI is an important indicator of the health of
the entire European economy. A result above 50 is considered positive
and strengthens the EUR, below 50 - as negative for the euro. Forecast
for January (preliminary release): 47.8 vs. 49.1 in December, 45.3 in
November, 50.0 in October vs. 13.6 in April, 29.7 in March, 51.6 in
February, 51 , 3 in January, which is unlikely to have a positive effect
on the euro, even despite the relative growth of the indicator. If the
data turns out to be worse than forecast,  the euro may fall sharply in
the short term.

###  **09:30 GBP UK's Services PMI by Markit Economics (preliminary
release)**

UK's Services PMI is an important indicator of the health of the UK
economy. The service sector employs most of the UK's working-age
population and accounts for approximately 78% of GDP. Financial services
are still the most important part of the services industry. If the data
turns out to be worse than the forecast and the previous value,  the
pound is likely to drop sharply in the short term. The data better than
the forecast and the previous value will have a positive impact on the
pound. At the same time, the result above 50 is considered positive and
strengthens the GBP, below 50 - as negative for the GBP.

Previous values ​​of the indicator: 49.4 in December, 47.6 in November,
51.4 in October, after falling to levels of 29.0 in May, 13.4 in April,
34.5 in March. Preliminary forecast for January: 45.3.

###  **13:30** **CAD Retail Sales Index**

Retail Sales Index is published monthly by Statistics Canada and
estimates total retail sales. The index is often considered an indicator
of consumer confidence and reflects the health of the retail sector in
the near term. A rise in the index is usually positive for the CAD; a
decrease in the indicator will negatively affect the CAD. The previous
value of the index (in October) was +0.4% after falling in March by
-9.9%, in April - by -25% and growth in May by +18.7%. If the data for
November turns out to be weaker than the forecast +0.2%, the CAD may
decline in the short term.
