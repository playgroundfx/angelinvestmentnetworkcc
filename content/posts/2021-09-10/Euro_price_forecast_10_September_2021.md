Euro: Is tapering real? Forecast as of 10.09.2021Dmitri Demidenko

The ECB President has used all her eloquence to convince [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s that
a decision to slow the pace of asset buying under the PEPP didn’t amount
to tapering. Do the [EURUSD][1] traders believe? Let us discuss the
Forex outlook and make up a trading plan.

## Weekly euro fundamental forecast

In 1980, Margaret Thatcher claimed that  “the lady is not for turning”
to indicate that she was not going to reverse her economic policies.
“The lady isn’t tapering,” Lagarde said at a [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) conference following
the ECB decision, which should have finally convince [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s of the
ECB's unwillingness to withdraw its monetary stimulus. Lagarde stressed
that the decline in PEPP purchases in the fourth quarter is merely a
reversal of the decision to accelerate purchases under the PEPP the ECB
had taken in March. This is reca[Libra](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/libra-creator/)ting the PEPP, not tapering. Do
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s believe the ECB president? Based on the [EURUSD][1] moves,
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are not fully convinced.

The long-awaited decision on PEPP was accompanied by an increase in GDP
forecasts for 2021 from 4.6% to 5% and inflation from 1.9% to 2.2%. At
the same time, the ECB expects a slowdown in consumer prices in the euro
area to 1.7% in 2022 and 1.5% in 2023, which implies that the ultra-easy
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) will remain for a very long time. The ECB will hardly
raise the rates until the end of 2023.

Despite the expected by Bloomberg experts reduction in the asset
purchases pace under the PEPP from €80 billion to €60 billion, the ECB
will continue to buy the entire volume of net bond issues issued by the
countries of the currency block. Of its total value of € 1.85 trillion,
about € 500 billion remained unspent, and the decision to complete the
program, according to Lagarde, will be made by the Governing Council in
December. The ECB should announce its verdict on the APP potential boost
from the current €20 billion per month in the same period.

The fact that the ECB hasn’t announced an increase in the asset
purchases under the ECB standard QE in September allowed the [EURUSD][1]
bulls to consolidate the price above the support 1.18 and drive it
higher towards the target at 1.1845 suggested in the [previous
article][2]. The euro bulls interpreted the ECB actions relative to the
PEPP as a taper, and markets will see it as a step towards the beginning
of QE tapering.

Based on the divergence in monetary policies, the euro should be going
down. European QE will continue for a very long time, and the ECB will
hardly raise the rates before the end of 2023. The Fed is willing to
hike the federal funds rate in 2022. Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta
President Raphael Bostic believes the Fed will pull back on its asset-
buying campaign in 2021, though he does not expect a decision in
September. The FOMC member Michelle Bowman says the weak August jobs
report will not throw off the central bank’s plan to scale back its
monthly bond purchases later this year.

### Weekly [EURUSD][1] trading plan

I suppose the [EURUSD][1] should be consolidating in the medium term.
Bulls are supported by economic expansion, and bears are encouraged by
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). If the price breaks out the resistance at 1.1845, it
could go higher towards 1.188. If the euro breaks out the support at
1.18, it should go back to 1.175 and 1.17.
