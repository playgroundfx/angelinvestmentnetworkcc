Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 10.09.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

Yesterday, the oil price updated a September 7 low.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

Yesterday, the oil price updated a September 7 low, but the short-term
uptrend's key support has not been broken out. The zone of 67.87 - 67.17
serves as the key support. Continue to look for buy patterns with the
target at the level of 70.33.

If the level of 67.17 is broken out, the trend will reverse down. In
this case, it will be possible to consider oil sales with a target in
the lower Target Zone 65.32 - 64.81.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

Open buy positions according to the pattern in 67.87 - 67.17.
TakeProfit: 70.33. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

Today the idea to trade the correction up to the Intermediary Zone 1805
- 1803 yielded profits. The Intermediary Zone serves as the short-term
downtrend's key resistance. As long as this zone is held, look for sales
according to the pattern with the target at September 8 low.

If the price breaks out the Intermediary Zone upside, the trend will
reverse up. In this case, look for gold purchases with a target in the
upper Target Zone 1827 - 1823.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

Sell according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 1805 - 1803.
TakeProfit: 1782. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

Yesterday's ECB decision on the interest rate and Christine Lagarde's
press conference did not significantly affect the euro/dollar rate. As a
result, the short-term uptrend's key support was held. Today continue to
look for euro purchases according to the pattern with the target at the
September 3 high + Gold Zone 1.1936 - 1.1928.

Selling the euro requires a breakout of the Intermediary Zone and
closing of the US trading session below. In this case, the short-term
trend will change to a down, and the target for sales will be the lower
Target Zone 1.1733 - 1.1715.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

Buy according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 1.1820 - 1.1812.
TakeProfit: 1.1908. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.
