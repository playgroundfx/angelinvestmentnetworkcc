GBPUSD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 10.09.2021 –
17.09.2021Alex Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions from corrections above the
level of 1.3599 with a target of 1.4050 – 1.4241.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
1.3599 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of 1.3400
– 1.3157.

 **Analysis:** Daily chart: the first wave of larger degree (1) is
formed and a downside correction continues forming as wave (2). Wave А
of (2) appears to be completed on the H4 chart. Wave B of (2) is forming
at the moment, with wave of smaller degree с of В unfolding inside.
Apparently, the third wave (iii) of с continues developing on the H1
chart. If the presumption is correct, the pair will continue rising to
the levels of 1.4050 – 1.4241. The level of 1.3599 is critical in this
scenario as its breakout will enable the pair to continue declining to
the levels of 1.3400 – 1.3157.
