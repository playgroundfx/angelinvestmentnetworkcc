USDCHF: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 10.09.2021 –
17.09.2021Alex Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions from corrections above the
level of 0.9103 with a target of 0.9370 – 0.9473.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
0.9103 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of 0.9018
– 0.8924.

 **Analysis:** [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) chart: presumably, a descending first wave of
larger degree (1) of 5 is formed and an ascending correction is now
developing as second wave (2) of 5. There's wave C of (2) developing on
the H4 chart, with wave i of C formed and a corrective wave ii of C
completed as part of it. The third wave iii of C appears to be forming
on the H1 chart, with wave of smaller degree (i) of iii and wave (ii) of
iii completed, and wave (iii) of iii developing as part of it,
supposedly. If the presumption is correct, the pair will continue to
rise to the levels of 0.9370 – 0.9473. The level of 0.9103 is critical
in this scenario. Its breakout will allow the pair to continue falling
to the levels of 0.9018 – 0.8924.
