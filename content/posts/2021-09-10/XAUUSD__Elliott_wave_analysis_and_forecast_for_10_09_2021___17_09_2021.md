XAUUSD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 10.09.2021 –
17.09.2021Alex Geuta

 **Main scenario:** long positions will be relevant above the level of
1676.71 with a target of 1915.00 – 2075.27 once a correction is formed.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
1676.71 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of
1602.20 – 1490.37.

 **Analysis:** an ascending third wave of larger degree (3) formed on
the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) chart, and a descending correction developed as the fourth
wave (4), supposedly. Apparently, the fifth wave (5) started forming on
the H4 chart, with wave 1 of (5) forming inside. The first counter-trend
wave of smaller degree i of 1 formed on the H1 chart, and a local
correction is developing in the form of wave ii of 1. If the presumption
is correct, the pair will continue to rise to the levels of 1915.00 –
2075.27 once the correction is over. The level of 1676.71 is critical in
this scenario as a breakout will enable the pair to continue declining
to the levels of 1602.20 – 1490.37.
