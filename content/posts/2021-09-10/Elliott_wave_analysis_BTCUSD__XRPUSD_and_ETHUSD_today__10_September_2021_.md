Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 10.09.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

The cryptocurrency pairs covered in the article should be forming the
third sub-waves in the bearish impulses.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

The BTCUSD market completed the upward corrective wave [B]. Next, the
market turned down and started declining, forming a new bearish impulse.
There have completed sub-waves 1 and 2, and the market is moving down in
wave 3. The Bitcoin price should soon reach the previous low of
41800.00, marked by sub-wave 1. Next, the market will continue
declining. One could enter sell trades in the current situation.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Sell 46793.66, TP 41800.00

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

The XRPUSD market must have completed the long-term linking wave (X).
Next, there started a new bearish wave. There should be unfolding a
bearish impulse. Sub-waves 1 and 2 seem to have finished. Wave 1 is an
impulse, and wave 2 is a correction, completed as a double zigzag
[W]-[X]-[Y]. Therefore, the Ripple price should go down in impulse 3 to
a level below 0.950, marked by wave 1. It is relevant to sell under the
current conditions.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] **** today:

Sell 1.138, TP 0.950

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

The ETHUSD market is developing the initial part of the new bearish
wave, which has started after corrective wave B completed. There must be
unfolding an impulse. So far, there have completed the first two legs of
the impulse, impulse 1 and correction 2, which is a double three
composed of sub-waves [W]-[X]-[Y]. The market must have started
declining in sub-wave 3, and the price should go down to a level below
2895.00, marked by impulse 1. One can enter sell trades in the current
situation.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Sell 3477.28 TP 2895.00
