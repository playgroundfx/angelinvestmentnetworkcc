Euro grows on rumors. Forecast as of 30.08.2021Dmitri Demidenko

Jerome Powell said nothing that could inspire [EURUSD][1] bulls, but the
pair's quotes grew all the same. Might the reason be a forecast for
European inflation? Let’s discuss that and make a trading plan.

## Weekly fundamental forecast for euro

Like the gold price depends on what the Fed thinks about inflation and
not inflation itself, the dollar rate depends on how the market
interprets Powell's statements and not his statements. The Fed president
didn't voice concern about Delta, saying the US economy had every chance
to return to full employment despite the short-term risk. He made a
hawkish statement that a QE taper would most likely start in 2021.
However, Treasury yields slumped, stock indexes grew, and [EURUSD][1]
quotes rocketed to 1.18.

Powell had found the right words to convince [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s that monetary
stimuli would be withdrawn slowly, so his address at Jackson Hole was
taken as market-friendly. The Fed chair underscored that inflation was
temporary and there was no connection between QE withdrawal and the
beginning of a federal funds rate hike as the central bank had set quite
a different criterion for increasing borrowing costs. That's good [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/)
for high-risk assets, but why the euro is growing isn't quite obvious.

The Fed's intention to normalize monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) and the ECB's passivity
raised the discount on the overnight rate to borrow the euro instead of
dollars earlier in August to the highest since 2020. To finance a carry
trade, the euro rate is -0.48%, and the dollar rate is +0.09%. In 2021,
carry trades funded by the euro produced returns for 17 out of 23
emerging currencies. Using the USD delivered losses for 15 of them.

The euro and the yen are currently the main funding currencies, and the
global risk appetite's boost is supposed to weaken them. At the same
time, treasury yields are falling, which doesn't let the dollar spread
wings. However, [EURUSD][1] bears will be able to claw back losses if US
labor stats exceed expectations.

Bloomberg experts forecast that non-farm payrolls will grow by as little
as 750 thousand in August. That's more than in most months of the year
but less than in June and July when the increase was +1 million.

### US employment dynamics

### Weekly trading plan for [EURUSD][1]

Moderate US employment forecasts and expectations of the eurozone's
consumer prices boost to 2.8%, their highest since 2012, support
[EURUSD][1] bulls as much as Jerome Powell's address at Jackson Hole.
The "buy the euro on rumors and sell it on facts" principle might be
realized once European inflation data are out. Weak data on Chinese
business activity and strong US employment stats can pressure the main
currency pair. On the whole, the [EURUSD][1]'s failure to hold above
1.18 will point to the buyer's weakness and become a reason for sales.
