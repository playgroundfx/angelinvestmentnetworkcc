Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 30.08.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

Cryptocurrency pairs continue forming bullish impulses, with the finals
sub-waves unfolding inside.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

The hourly BTCUSD price chart displays the structure of the corrective
up wave [B], composed of the sub-waves (A)-(B)-(C). There is developing
the final subwave (C) as an impulse composed of sub-waves 1-2-3-4-5,
with the final wave 5 unfolding inside. Sub-waves [1]-[2]-[3]-[4] have
completed, and the final sub-wave [5] has recently started developing.
The price could go up to a level of 51100.00, following wave [5].

wave [4] as a regular zigzag (A)-(B)-(C). There is unfolding the initial
part of the final wave [5]. There should soon form sub-waves
