##  **Elliott wave forecast for BTCUSD, ETHUSD, XRPUSD for today**

###  **Elliott wave[BTCUSD][1] analysis**

analysis Bitcoin, Ripple, Ethereum][2]**

In the upward impulse wave currently unfolding, there is forming a long
corrective wave (4). It is developing as a zigzag A-B-C, where A is an
impulse, B is a triple zigzag. Wave C is also a five-wave impulse that
hasn’t yet completed. The market should be moving down in the sub-waves
[3]-[4]-[5] to a level of 10516.68, as it is outlined in the chart. This
level is the previous low made by the bearish impulse wave A.

The XRPUSD market continues moving in the uptrend. The chart displays an
impulse wave that is composed of the sub-waves 1-2-3-4-5. There have
completed impulses 1 and 3, and correction 2, which is a double zigzag.
The market is now forming correction 4 that is likely to complete as a
double three [w]-[x]-[y]. In the near future, the price should be
declining in the final zigzag (y) to a level of 0.252. When the
corrective movement ends, the market could be rising.

###  **Elliott wave[ETHUSD][5] analysis**

The ETHUSD market is about to finish the corrective wave (4) within the
bullish impulse [5]. It signals that the market should continue rising
in the final wave (5). Correction (4) has completed as a horizontal
contracting triangle a-b-c-d-e. Therefore, the price should be rising
next in wave (5) to a level of 420.00. After that, there should start a
new downtrend.
