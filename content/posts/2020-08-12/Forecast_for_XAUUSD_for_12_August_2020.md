Forecast for XAU/USD: precious metals fell into disgraceDmitri Demidenko

## Fundamental forecast for gold for today

### Gold may drift apart from the sector’s other assets



The market can punish for excessive self-confidence. As long as the
dollar was weak and the US bond yield wandered near its historic highs,
gold didn’t complain about the lack of bullish forecasts. Alas! Precious
metals fell into disgrace once the bond market rates grew on the
Treasury’s increased debt issuance, better macro statistics, lower
number on new COVID cases in the US, and Russia’s intention to start
using the first vaccine.

Gold registered the worst one-day evolution in 7 years, pulling down
silver, platinum, and palladium too.

[As I supposed][1], the signal of [XAU/USD][2]’s correction was good US
data on the labor market. The [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s were truly surprised when the
employment rate grew amidst the worsening epidemiological situation and
slow lockdown lifting. They are sure that the Democrats and the
Republicans have agreed about fiscal stimulus despite all related
hardships. Add the record low number of new cases in the past four weeks
and positive [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) about the vaccine, and the bears’ euphoria about
treasuries becomes more understandable. The rates went up, gold
collapsed.



### Gold and bold yields evolution

What’s next? This situation is painfully similar to 2011. The [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s
were disappointed that inflation hadn’t grown on the Fed’s enormous
liquidity volume, and gold tumbled.

Today, no one knows where consumer prices will go. Inflation is usually
related to a strong economy, while [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s doubt that the US GDP
should return to the trend fast. Citigroup believes that gold may have
risen to $2,400 by the end of 2020, and BofA Merrill Lynch forecasts
growth to $3,000 within 18 months, thinking that financial repressions
and a weak dollar are still there. So, the bulls in gold must be
confident. But I think it’s time to re-estimate this asset’s potential.

The precious metal became part and parcel of investment portfolios. Its
share didn’t often go below 1% or above 1.2% in the past five years. On
average, its share was 1.09%. As the stock market’s cap is growing, it’s
42 thousand tons or $200 trillion. Gold found its place and is likely to
consolidate at $1,700-2,100 per ounce in the medium or long term.

Investors should probably consider other metals whose share in
industrial use is higher than gold’s one. For example, the car
industry’s fast growth makes platinoids interesting. The Fed has bought
out $224 billion bonds issued by car manufacturers. It’s more than in
any other economic sector. The EU intends to spend $61 billion on
projects tied to climate-friendly measures.

Since [platinum’s][4] and [palladium’s][5] shares in the production of
autocatalysts are high, I recommend buying them with targets at $1,050
and $2,280 per ounce.
