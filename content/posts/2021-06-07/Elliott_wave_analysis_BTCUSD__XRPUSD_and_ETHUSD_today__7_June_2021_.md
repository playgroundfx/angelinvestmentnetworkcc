Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 07.06.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

All cryptocurrencies are expected to continue to rise. Let's consider
each pair in more detail.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

The BTCUSD market, most likely, is now forming an upward corrective wave
[2]. Perhaps it takes the form of a simple zigzag (A) - (B) - (C), where
(A) and (C) are impulses, and (B) is a horizontal corrective wave
unfolding as a contracting triangle A-B-C-D-E. This triangle may already
be fully completed, so the impulse (C) is expected to develop shortly.
It may complete near level 44500.00. At this level, wave [2] will reach
the Fibonacci level of 50% of wave [1].

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 36689.49, TP 44500.00

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

The XRPUSD market is developing an upward linking wave (X), which can
take the form of a simple A-B-C zigzag. Impulse wave A is completed,
correction B also seems to be formed. Wave B is a sideways pattern,
namely a double zigzag [W] - [X] - [Y]. Thus, the initial part of the
final impulse wave C is currently unfolding. It is expected to complete
near level 1.153. At this level, wave (X) will reach the Fibonacci level
of 38.2% of wave (W).

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] today:

Buy 0.964, TP 1.153

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

The ETHUSD market is forming an upward corrective wave 2 as a simple
zigzag [A] - [B] - [C]. An impulse wave [A] is completed as well as the
bear correction [B], which is a double zigzag. Impulse wave [C] is still
unfolding, more precisely, its last part which is sub-wave (5). It is
assumed that within wave (5) prices will rise to the level of 3340.00.
At this level, wave 2 will reach the Fibonacci level of 61.8% of wave 1.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Buy 2781.62, TP 3340.00
