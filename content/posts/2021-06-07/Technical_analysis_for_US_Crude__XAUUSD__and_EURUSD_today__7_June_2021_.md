Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

After updating the local high on Friday and reaching the Gold Zone 69.73
- 69.46, the oil price is now trading in the correction.

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

After updating the local high on Friday and reaching the Gold Zone 69.73
- 69.46, the oil price is now trading in the correction. The probable
target of the correction is the test of the Additional Zone 68.51 -
68.38. After testing the Additional Zone, look for purchases according
to the pattern with a target at the day's high.

If the Gold Zone is broken out, the next trend target will be Target
Zone 2 72.64 - 72.11.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

Buy according to the pattern in Additional Zone 68.51 - 68.38.
TakeProfit: 69.81. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

On Friday, gold price broke out the Intermediary Zone 1880 - 1878 and
the short-term trend reversed up. However, the medium-term chart shows a
medium-term downtrend. As a result, there was a clash of interests
between short-term buyers and medium-term sellers.

In this situation, I recommend waiting for the test of the key support
1873 - 1871 and looking for a buy pattern. If the pattern does not
appear, but a breakout of the zone occurs, then go back to sales.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

Buy according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 1873 - 1871.
TakeProfit: 1895. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

Last week, a short-term euro downtrend continued. Also, a “1-2-3” sell
pattern was formed in the Intermediary Zone 1.2229 - 1.2220.

On Friday, the price corrected to this pattern. The price tested the
resistance level of 1.2173.

Today, look for sales from level 1.2173, as well as from the
Intermediary Zone 1.2200 - 1.2192. The target for sales will be the
lower Target Zone 1.2090 - 1.2072.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

Sell according to the pattern in the zone of 1.2200 - 1.2173.
TakeProfit: Target Zone 1.2090 - 1.2072. StopLoss: according to the
pattern rules.
