Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 15.06.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

EURUSD is correcting within a short-term downtrend.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

The short-term oil uptrend continues with the target in the Target Zone
2 72.64 - 72.11. Another high was set yesterday, after which a
correction began. As a part of the correction, the support zone 70.78 -
70.71 was reached. The price didn't break out the zone, so look for
purchases according to the pattern in the beforementioned support zone.

If the support zone 70.78 - 70.71 is broken out, then the correction
will continue with the target at the Additional Zone 70.11 - 69.98.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

  1. Buy according to the pattern in Micro-zone 70.78 - 70.71. TakeProfit: 71.41. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. Sell when level 70.71 is broken out. TakeProfit: Additional Zone 70.11 - 69.98. StopLoss: beyond the local high.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

Gold is testing the short-term downtrend's key resistance 1869 - 1867.
Enter sales according to the pattern with a target at yesterday's low.
After updating yesterday's low, the target will be the Gold Zone 1835 -
1833.

If the Intermediary Zone 1869 - 1867 is broken out upside and the price
closes higher at the US session, then the short-term trend will reverse
up. In this case, look for gold purchases with a target in the upper
1894 - 1889 Target Zone.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

Sell according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 1869 - 1867.

correction is the Additional Zone 1.2141 - 1.2136. After the test of the
Additional Zone, it will be profitable to look for sales again according
to the pattern with the target at level 1.2096.
