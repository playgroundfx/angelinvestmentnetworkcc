Aussie is a role model. Forecast as of 15.06.2021Dmitri Demidenko

Since the beginning of March, the [AUDUSD][1] pair has spent most of the
time in the consolidation range of 0.76-0.78. Why is this happening, and
will the important events of the week ending June 18 be able to push the
pair out of the beforementioned range?

## Weekly Australian dollar fundamental forecast

The market, like a child, in most cases does not need our advice, but
our examples. Australia serves as the best example that the Fed is right
about the temporary nature of inflation. The country's economy and labor
market have managed to fully recover to pre-recession levels. However,
this did not lead to higher wages or accelerated consumer prices. The
RBA still pursues the ultra-easy monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), which discourages the
[AUDUSD][1] bulls from going ahead.

### Australian economic recovery

Even though most of the time since the beginning of March, AUDUSD has
been in a trading range of 0.76-0.78, traders have not lost faith in the
Australian dollar. Hedge funds hold net AUD longs of 20,509 futures
contracts and sincerely hope the RBA will join the central banks in
Canada, Norway, and New Zealand in declaring monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
normalization. In July, Philip Lowe and his colleagues will decide on
the fate of the QE program. At the June meeting, the RBA officials
outlined an action plan, including various [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) for adjusting the QE
program: from moving to buying securities with longer circulation
periods to introducing a dependence of transaction volumes on data flow
and economic prospects.

The RBA is not going to raise the cash rate until 2024 when inflation is
expected to stay in the 2-3% range for a long time. Given the
acceleration of consumer prices in the US, the Fed will theoretically
take a step towards monetary restriction first, which is a bearish
factor for [AUDUSD][1].

### Dynamics of inflation and rates in Australia and the USA

A strong commodity market creates favorable conditions for the
Australian dollar, while Canberra's tensions with Beijing are a major
deterrent to AUD purchases. It should be understood that a significant
part of the positive [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) from China contributed to the accelerated
economic growth in Australia over the past two decades. At the same
time, the diplomatic conflict and the trade war, forcing Australia to
conclude free trade agreements with Japan, South Korea, Indonesia and
the UK, and thus diversify the existing risks, do not positively affect
country's GDP.

Thus, [AUDUSD][1] bulls are supported by the full recovery of the
Australian economy and labor market, a strong commodity market, and
expectations of the RBA's adjustments to the Australian QE. The bears
are supported by a faster acceleration of inflation in the US than in
Australia, as well as the conflict between Canberra and Beijing. The
balance between negative and positive [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) leaves AUDUSD in a
consolidation range of 0.76-0.78. Will the Fed meeting, Philip Lowe's
speech, and the Australian employment data change the situation?

### Weekly [AUDUSD][1] trading plan

In my opinion, it will be possible to enter [AUDUSD][1] mid-term
purchases if the pair rises above 0.78. Its fall below 0.7685 will
increase the risks of short-term sales.
