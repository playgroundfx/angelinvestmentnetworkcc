Dollar fastened the safety belt. Forecast as of 15.06.2021Dmitri
Demidenko

The Fed managed to calm down the market, convincing [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s of the
temporary nature of high inflation in the US and a slow pace of the
monetary normalization. Under these circumstances, any doubts
immediately affect the [EURUSD][1]. Let us discuss the Forex outlook and
make up a trading plan.

## Weekly US dollar fundamental forecast

Everything turned upside down in the financial markets. In March, the
growth in the Treasury yield resulted in the US dollar strengthening. In
June, everything is exactly the opposite. US bond yields are falling,
the greenback is growing. It looks like buying the rumor and selling the
[news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/). In early spring, expectations of inflation acceleration led to
Treasuries sell-offs. As soon as consumer prices soared to 5%, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s
began to exit Treasury shorts, which allowed 10-year bonds to show the
best weekly performance in a year.

### Dynamics of Treasury yields

The US bond market does look a little too calm. Since 1985, with the
current core inflation rate of 3.8%, the yield on 10-year Treasuries has
never dropped below 6%, and now it hovers around 1.5%. Consumer prices,
excluding food and energy prices, have jumped by 8.2% Y-o-Y over the
past three months. Consumer inflation expectations for the coming year
have hit a record high of 4%, according to New York Fed research, and
rates on debt liabilities are still low. Is it a paradox? No, it isn’t!
It's just market confidence in the Fed. The dovish stance of the Fed’s
officials seems to be an announcement that it is time to fasten the
safety belts, a smooth landing begins. It calms the financial markets.
Isn’t it a reason for the new all-time highs hit by the US stock
indexes?

The Fed has convinced [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s of the temporary nature of high
inflation and slow monetary normalization. Until recently, the markets
expected that tapering of the $120-billion quantitative easing program
would begin only at the start of 2022. Only rumors that this process,
like the process of raising the federal funds rate, could go faster
lured [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s back to the US dollar.

About 40% of 51 Bloomberg experts expect the Federal Reserve to make its
first step towards reducing asset purchases pace in August; 24% of
respondents predict that this will happen in September. Rumors that the
tapering of the QE may begin earlier than previously expected, and
already at the meeting on June 15-16, the central bank should signal an
interest rate hike, not in 2024, but in 2023, have sent the [EURUSD][2]
to the bottom of figure 21. In March, 4 FOMC officials expected the
interest rate hike in 2022, 7 - in 2023, the rest - in 2024. More than
half of economists surveyed by Bloomberg believe that the median
forecast for the rate hike will shift to 2023 this summer. The reason is
higher inflation estimates and a better outlook for US employment and
GDP.

### Weekly [EURUSD][2] trading plan

The Fed, which is willing to avoid the repetition of the taper tantrum
of 2013, has been acting correctly so far. However, it will have to take
active steps already in June. The economic data challenge the Fed’s
willingness to maintain the ultra-easy monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) for a long time
until there are actual reports, not only forecasts. I do not expect the
Fed to act aggressively and prefer to buy the [EURUSD][2] when the price
is above 1.213 or rebounds up from the support at 1.2045.
