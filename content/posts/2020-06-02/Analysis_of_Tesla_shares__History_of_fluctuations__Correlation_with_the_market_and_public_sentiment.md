Tesla is Bitcoin of the stock market. Part 1Mikhail Hypov

##  **Analysis of Tesla. Correlation with the market and dependence of
the stock rate on Musk’s tweets. Global scenario of future
fluctuations.**

In January 2020 I made a forecast for [Tesla][1] stock which you can
check [here][2]. The share price was around 524 USD then.

The January forecast is displayed in the chart above.

Correlation with the market and public sentiment][4]

And here you see the actual market state, up to early June 2020. On the
whole, the forecast can’t be called “unsuccessful”, but the targets were
objectively underestimated because the actual results turned out to be
better than expected. Even if the dynamics of stock movements partly
coincides with the wave structure, these are different levels on the
whole. So, the long-term scenario must be corrected.

It took me much time to find out the reason of that mistake. Finally, I
gained a clear insight into the situation which I’d like to share with
you. Let’s start.

To take the right decision, competent [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s check a company’s
reporting, the dynamics of its financial indicators over a few years and
its board members. They also analyse the market, learn about the
company’s plans and gain other important clues.  This type of [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s
is in the minority. They usually are governors of large hedging funds
and owners of so-called “long money” or “intelligent money”. It’s
important to observe those [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s’ behaviour and try to understand
their motives because they are indicative of future many-year trends. To
sum up, it’s fundamental factors and a long-term investment span that
are crucial to success in the classic stock market.

However, [Tesla][1] is a pattern-breaker. Elon Musk is someone who loves
shocking behaviour and publicity. He often appears in public and turns
presentations of new and future products into a show.  His management
team stays in the background and many don’t even know it exists. So,
Elon Musk’s personality is strongly linked to his companies. His
personal success or failures therefore affect the quotes of [Tesla][1],
Musk’s only publicly listed company.

Because ordinary people can easily access the market and because Elon
Musk has been such an attention whore, [Tesla][1] price is a Musk
confidence index. I’m going to prove it now.

[Tesla][1] outran such giants as BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Ford Motor in
January 2020 and ranked second after Toyota Motor. Then it was obvious
the company stock price had nothing to do with its fundamental
indicators.

![LiteForex: Analysis of Tesla shares. History of fluctuations.
Correlation with the market and public sentiment][5]

The [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) of hype around [Tesla][1] starts with Musk’s presentation of
the future Cybertruck. The show didn’t go smooth as we know: the
Cybertruck windows shattered after having been struck by a steel ball
during demonstration of their shatter-proof qualities.

That event was associated with a 7% slump in the company’s shares.

![LiteForex: Analysis of Tesla shares. History of fluctuations.
Correlation with the market and public sentiment][6]

That slump also confirmed that lots of private [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are guided by
Musk’s public performances and not by the company’s fundamental
indicators. Elon Musk’s excuses and publication of a successful shatter-
proof test the following day didn’t save the situation.

The stock started growing only after Musk’s Cybertruck was spotted near
the Nobu restaurant ([photo source][7]).

![LiteForex: Analysis of Tesla shares. History of fluctuations.
Correlation with the market and public sentiment][8]

Obviously, Elon Musk hadn’t been using the prototype for personal needs
and that drive was a well planned viral marketing action. On the one
hand, it cost nothing. On the other hand, it heated the craze and hit
the sceptics who had asserted the car would never be seen in the
streets.

![LiteForex: Analysis of Tesla shares. History of fluctuations.
Correlation with the market and public sentiment][9]

The photos were published on 9th December 2019 and since that day a
strongest bullish trend had started.![LiteForex: Analysis of Tesla
shares. History of fluctuations. Correlation with the market and public
sentiment][10]

The stock approached the psychological level of 1,000 USD twice, but the
coronavirus panic had its effect and the price started falling together
with the stock market.![LiteForex: Analysis of Tesla shares. History of
fluctuations. Correlation with the market and public sentiment][11]

The chart above shows that [Tesla][1] price started falling
simultaneously with the market (the chart shows the S&P500 index for
comparison). We see that [TSLA ][1] fluctuations are two times bigger,
which proves again the presence of many unqualified [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s who bought
Tesla on hype. The chart also shows that Tesla started recovering
positions 5 days before the index did even if their fall had occurred on
the same day.

The growth started on 19th March, right one day before Musk
[tweet][12]ed about COVID-19: “Based on current trends, probably close
to zero new cases in US too by end of April”.  Musk’s fans must have
taken this message as a signal to buy, which they did.

Correlation with the market and public sentiment][13]

But the H1 chart above shows that buying volumes soared and calmed down
within 1 hour in an absolutely dead market in a bearish trend just 1 day
before the above tweet. It’s hard to imagine that someone except Musk
himself or his people should want to buy those huge volumes of Tesla
stock in those circumstances.![LiteForex: Analysis of Tesla shares.

sentiment][14]

Another example of manipulation is when Musk announced that [Tesla ][1]
share’s price was too high ([original tweet][15]).![LiteForex: Analysis
of Tesla shares. History of fluctuations. Correlation with the market
and public sentiment][16]

It occurred on 1st May (red arrow no 2 in the chart above) while a sell-
off started one day earlier. Was that a coincidence too? I don’t think
so.![LiteForex: Analysis of Tesla shares. History of fluctuations.
Correlation with the market and public sentiment][17]

We’re witnessing another stock price growth now, which has exceeded
general market movements. Obviously, this growth isn’t supported by
fundamental reasons. The optimism comes from [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s who believed Elon
Musk again after the successful launch of Crew Dragon. You may wonder
what it has to do with [Tesla][1]. Nothing!

This fact just like all the previous cases only shows that [Tesla][1]’s
stock price is crowd-dependent and doesn’t depend on fundamental
factors. It rather reflects the Musk confidence index and has nothing to
do with his car company.

So, what kind of a future is in store for Tesla and where are the
trading targets located?

My next analytical article will deal with these questions.
