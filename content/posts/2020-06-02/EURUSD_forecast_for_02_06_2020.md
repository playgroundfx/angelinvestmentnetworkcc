Euro: save Rome or dieDmitri Demidenko

## ECB tries to prove that Italy’s central bank is strong enough to
support the economy during the pandemic

When the market is too optimistic, the good [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) is eagerly discussed
and the bad [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) is ignored, I start thinking that it is the right time
to exit. While Donald Trump is considering retaliatory measures to China
because of Hong Kong, the S&P 500 is growing despite the deepest
recession of the US economy since the Great Depression, the increase in
the unemployment towards 20%, and the gloomy forecasts of the
Congressional Budget Office. The CBO has lowered its GDP projection for
2030 made up in January by $15.7 trillion, suggesting the US economy
should shrink by 5.6% in 2020, and the US economic recovery should take
several years.

The S&P 500 is just one growth driver among several ones encouraging the
[EUR/USD][1] bulls. During the stress in the financial markets,
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s turned to safe havens, first of all, the greenback and
Treasuries. However, once the global economies are being reopened,
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are lured back to risky assets. The USD index has been falling
over the past few days, the 30-year Treasury yield reached its highest
level since March 20. Nonetheless, the US-China trade relations are
still uncertain. According to Bloomberg's source familiar with the
matter, China has told state-owned firms to halt purchases of farm
products from the United States after Washington said it would eliminate
special treatment for Hong Kong to punish Beijing. China may not meet
the obligations under the phase 1 trade deal signed in January.

The euro is also growing amid the French-German fiscal stimulus offer,
the announcement of the European Commission about issuing bonds worth
€750 billion, and the hopes for the expansion of the ECB’s €750 billion
Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme. Investors expect that Italy’s
bond yields continue falling, and the Italy-German yield gap will be
narrowing, which should finally defeat the Eurosceptics. Christine
Lagarde is going to save Rome, and Italy is often compared with Japan.
The same aging of the population, the same endless struggle for
inflation growth...Nevertheless, Japan has its central bank, and the ECB
has to prove that Italy's central bank is also strong.

In addition to the QE boosting, the ECB may also start purchasing fallen
angels and reinvesting incomes from the long-term asset-purchase
program.

The fiscal and monetary stimulus push the [EUR/USD][1] up and make banks
revise their projections. HSBC sees the pair at 1.1 in late 2020, up
from the previous forecast of 1.05, amid the drop in the risk of the
euro-area breakup. Furthermore, the forecast of Bloomberg experts also
suggests the EUR/USD be at 1.1.

Nonetheless, the French-German plan hasn’t been approved yet, and the
[EUR/USD][1] bulls could be set back as the ECB is not taking active
measures right now. These facts, as well as the escalation of the US-
China trade war, may force [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s to start exiting longs. After all,
the euro can still rise above $1.115.
