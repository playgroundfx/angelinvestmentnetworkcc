Short-term forecast for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 19.10.2020Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for day traders.

Euro continues to be bearish. It formed a false breakout last week.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

Oil is testing strong resistance at Target Zone 5 [41.67 - 40.92]. If it
is broken, the next target along the trend will be Target Zone 6 [49.17
- 48.42].

If the resistance is not broken, there will be a correction to the key
support area [37.34 - 36.72].

The short-term trend is upward. Last week, oil was trading in a range
between 41.24 and 39.27 levels. The close of the week happened near the
resistance.

The target for the trend is the upper Target Zone [42.56 - 42.01]. I
recommend holding longs up to the target or looking for new targets
based on correction according to the patterns.

To consider oil shorts, traders need to change the trend to a downtrend.
This will happen if the Intermediary Zone [38.85 - 38.6] is broken.

### [USCrude ][1]trading ideas for today:

Buy on correction from the trend line. TakeProfit: Target Zone [42.56 -
42.01]. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

For gold, the medium-term downtrend continues. The key resistance is
located at the levels [1951.0 - 1941.7]. The area of profitable prices
for shorts is between the levels [1951.0 - 1913.1]. I recommend looking
for a pattern for shorting gold from the area of favourable prices.

Let's go to a chart of a smaller timeframe and analyze the local
impulse. The trend is up in the chart. The target is Target Zone [1951.0
- 1941.7].

Now the bulls are trying to break through the local resistance
Additional Zone [1911.3 - 1908.7]. If successful, look for a long entry
point at the zone retest.

If AZ is held, the Intermediary Zone [1880.7 - 1875.4] will be tested -
the key support for the trend. Look for longs from it in this case.

### [Gold][2] trading ideas for today:

  1. Buy at the retest of Additional Zone [1911.3 - 1908.7] after breakout and consolidation. TakeProfit: Target Zone [1951.0 - 1941.7]. StopLoss: below the next local low.

  2. Buy according to the pattern from Intermediary Zone [1880.7 - 1875.4]. TakeProfit: Target Zone [1951.0 - 1941.7]. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

The euro is still bearish. It formed a false breakout pattern last week.
This week. I recommend looking for shorts according to the pattern with
the target in Target Zone 2 [1.1611 - 1.1591].

The short-term trend changed to a downtrend last week. The target for
shorts is now the lower Target Zone [1.1631 - 1.1611].

Today I recommend looking for euro shorts from strong resistances:
Additional Zone [1.1752 - 1.1746] and Intermediary Zone [1.1816 -
1.1804]. Wait for a test of the zones, look for a pattern and sell.

If any zone is broken upward with further consolidation, there will be
an opportunity to open longs up to the next margin zone.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

  1. Sell according to the pattern from Additional Zone [1.1752 - 1.1746]. TakeProfit: Target Zone [1.1631 - 1.1611]. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. In case the Additional Zone [1.1752 - 1.1746] is broken out - buy at a retest. TakeProfit: Intermediary Zone [1.1816 - 1.1804]. StopLoss: below the next local low.
