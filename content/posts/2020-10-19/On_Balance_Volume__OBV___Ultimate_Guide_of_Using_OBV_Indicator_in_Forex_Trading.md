On Balance Volume: How to Use OBV Indicator GuideMikhail Hypov

This article is a step by step guide to the On Balance Volume indicator.
You will learn what is obv, [how to](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-trading-how-to/) use the obv indicator, [how to](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-trading-how-to/) custom
the obv settings and interpret the signals to buy and sell.

The OBV indicator is a technical tool used to anticipate the price moves
based on the trading volumes. It confirms the ongoing trends, spots the
pivot points, and support/resistance levels. The on-balance volume is
quite simple and user-friendly.

This indicator was originally designed for work in the stock market,
later it has been successful used by Forex traders. The creator of this
indicator believed that the main driving force in the market is the
volume. The OBV indicator is efficient in trading almost all Forex
instruments.

The article covers the following subjects:

Traders can employ the OBV indicator in the analysis of stock charts,
futures, and cryptocurrencies. The OBV is also well-combined with other
technical tools. I will cover all the aspects of trading with the OBV in
this review.

## What is On Balance Volume (OBV) Indicator

The On Balance Volume indicator measures the volume changes to make
price predictions. It is based on the theory that a significant price
movement always follows a sharp change in the trading volume. For
example, when large traders invest in an asset, the trade volume
increases. The asset price will also rise some time later.

You can read detailed instructions on adding indicators to the MT4
charts in the article [[Bollinger Bands](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/bollinger-bands.html) Indicator in Forex Explained][1].

The On Balance Volume is displayed at the bottom of the chart. The OBV
line goes up when the price grows and goes down when the price falls. A
sharp move of the indicator suggests big traders are stepping into the
market. A smooth movement indicates that other traders are entering the
market.

I offer a brief description of the On Balance Volume so that you can
understand how the obv works.

OBV:

  * The OBV is a momentum indicator that measures the volume changes to predict price movements.
  * The OBV shows the sentiment of big traders and the crowd to predict a bullish or bearish momentum.
  * The OBV calculation formula is as follows: if the current closing price is higher than the last closing price, the current obv is added to the previous value. When the previous close is higher than the current, the current volume is subtracted from the prior value.
  * The OBV doesn’t consider the price movement intensity.

The On-Balance Volume OBV indicator is the best in trading markets. In
this case, it spots the pivot points or the trend continuation signals.
The OBV indicator performs well in the short-term timeframes. The reason
is the natural volatility that may affect the indicator signals.

### OBV Indicator History

The [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) of the Balanced Volume indicator goes back to the 1940s. In
1946, stock analysts  Woods and Vignola developed a technique, called
initially "continuous volume" , that became the On Balance Volume
prototype.

Later on, the On-Balance Volume indicator was developed by a prominent
financial analyst, Joseph E. Granville. Granville believed the trade
volume to be the main driver of the financial markets. He popularized
the OBV technique in his book _New Key to Stock Market Profits_.
Granville compared the trade volume to the steam that is driving the
market engine.

Later on, the OBV tool was more and more widely used. The Forex OBV
indicator appeared with the popularization of currency trading. It has
become so popular among forex analysts that it is now included in the
standard list of technical analysis tools.

## How does On Balance Volume Indicator Work

The indicator looks like the simplest graph with a signal line.

It does not show overbought and oversold levels like many oscillators
and its absolute value does not matter here.

What does On-Balance Volume indicator tell you?

The OBV indicator sends the following signals:

  *  **Trend confirmation.** If the curved line goes up following the price rise or down following the price fall, the ongoing trend is likely to continue.
  *  **Trend reversal (divergence).** A buy signal, bullish reversal, appears when the indicators line goes up amid the downtrend of the price chart. A sell signal appears when the OBV line goes down amid the uptrend in the price chart.
  *  **Level breakout.** This signal works in a similar way when the price chart breaks out key levels. The breakout of the OBV key level is often followed by a sharp price momentum in the direction corresponding to the breakout.
  *  **A sharp surge in volumes.** If you see a sharp rise in the indicator line, it signals that big traders are entering the market. A strong on balance volume momentum is a trend reversal signal if it goes against the trend. It confirms the trend continuation when the obv indicator and the price chart are going in the same direction.
  *  **Crossing the Moving Average.** If the on balance volume line breaks through the MA upside, it is a buy signal. When the OBV breaks through the MA downside, it is a sell signal.

Besides, all the above signals do not contradict each other, they often
appear all at once, which could serve as additional confirmation.

The above chart is an example of how the OBV signals work together. The
purple line marks a common bearish divergence. You see that the OBV
indicator doesn’t confirm the uptrend indicated in the price chart.

At the reversal point, there is a strong indicator momentum. I marked it
with the red arrow. This signal means strong selling pressure, which
confirms that the uptrend should soon turn down.

Amid this sharp price movement, the chart breaks out the red line in the
OBV window. So, there is another bearish signal. Along with the entire
down move, starting from the very beginning of the price fall, the
indicator is following the price chart, confirming the bear trend
continuation. I marked it with the blue arrow.

So, there is almost the entire range of signals. Each next signal
confirms the prior one.

### How to install, run, and custom the OBV indicator?

You don't have to look for the OBV indicator MT4 download on the
Internet. The On-Balance Volume indicator is among standard technical
tools available on most trading platforms. So, the OBV must already be
in your trading terminal.

You can find the On Balance Volume in the Indicators/Volume folders and
add the tool by double-clicking on it.

Next, you will see the settings window. The Parameters section is
elementary. You can set the price chart, which the indicator formula is
applied to (Open, Close, and so on), set the line color, and add highs
and lows.

Default settings will suit will, so you do not have to change anything.
To confirm the settings, press the OK button at the bottom of the chart.

## OBV Indicator Calculation & Formula

I shall briefly describe how the OBV indicator formula is calculated.
The on balance volume formula is as follows.

If the current closing price is higher than the previous closing price:

 **OBV = Previous OBV + current volume**

If the current closing price is higher than the previous closing price:

 **OBV = Previous OBV - current volume**

If the current closing price is equal to the previous closing price:

 **Current OBV = Previous OBV**

 _As an example, let us assume that in the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) chart, yesterday’s
volume was 4064. The price continues growing today, and the volume is
203 points._

 _Therefore, the total OBV value by the end of the day will be:_

 _OBV = 4064 + 203 = 4267_

It is not convenient to calculate On Balance Volume manually. You’d
better employ the MT4 tools. To make the OBV formula as clear as
possible, I prepared a calculation model in Excel.

>  **You can download the Balance Volume(OBV) Indicator Excel
Sheet[here][2]. **

If you have problems with the OBV excel sheet, refer to the step-by-step
guide in the [Bollinger Bands](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/bollinger-bands.html) Excel section in the article [Bollinger
Bands Indicator in Forex Explained][1].

It is very easy to use the OBV Excel sheet.

You enter the values in the corresponding pink columns over the needed
period – the closing price and the trade volume.

The values written in the pink columns are just an example. You should
delete them when you work with the excel sheet. If you do not know the
volume level, you can find it out using a common tool Volume. You enter
the values for each bar separately.

The table contains a formula for 25 bars. If you need to carry out the
analysis over a longer period, just stretch the table below.

On the right side of the table, there are the price and the on-balance
volume charts. They will be recalculated automatically after you enter
new values into the table. With the help of these charts, you will be
able to carry out the same analysis as in the trading terminal.

## Online Balance Volume Indicator Interpretation: Reading the Charts

 **On balance volume is a momentum indicator.** It considers only the
movements up or down.

An essential analysis element is a comparison of the On Balance Volume
line movements and the price changes. I presented examples of such
analysis above.

### OBV Divergences

Divergences are quite common signals. Divergence occurs when the
indicator and the price chart co in opposite directions. There can be
bullish and bearish divergence.

I covered the divergence signals in detail in the article Divergence and
Convergence in Forex. The OBV divergence works in the same way as with
other technical tools.

Let study a few examples of the obv divergence indicator:

Purple lines in the above chart mark divergence. Note that the price
chart indicates a downtrend while the on balance volume line starts
rising gradually. Finally, the trend reverses, and a bullish trend
starts (red line).

A bear divergence occurs in the opposite situation. The price chart
rises, the obv line goes down. An alternative is the sideways movement
of the OBV in a bull trend. In both cases, the signal means a soon price
reversal, and a bearish trend starts.

The chart schematically displays a bearish divergence (purple lines).
The price chart goes up while the on balance volumes are gradually
declining. Later, the trend turns down (red line).

There is a special technical tool designed to spot divergences quickly.
It is TrueT OBV Divergence Indicator.

The TrueT OBV Divergence analyzes the last 300 visible bars and paints
diverging lines in the On Balance Volume window. A great benefit of this
tool is the alert signaling divergence and many additional settings
compared to the classical version.

### OBV Trend Confirmation

In trading with the trend, it is important to understand if the ongoing
trend is exhausting or it will continue. Here, we can use the OBV trend
confirmation signal.

When the bullish trend is developing, the OBV indicator hits higher
highs. The same is in the opposite situation. The bear trend is
confirmed when the obv lows are getting lower.

The green line in the above chart marks a bullish trend. The OBV line
also demonstrates an uptrend. Therefore, while the line is getting up
the uptrend strength is confirmed.

### OBV Breakout

A typical trading signal is the breakout of the support or resistance
line. It signals the current trend is strong, and it should continue.

There are also false breakouts when the price breaks out the support or
resistance line for a short time and then goes back.

 **The technical indicator OBV** helps one spot such breakouts. Traders
use the obv breakouts to filter false signals.

The principle of spotting false breakouts is based on the trend
confirmation techniques. A strong trend is always accompanied by the obv
line moving in the same direction. When the trend is false, the obv line
is going in the opposite direction.

To check the strength of the breakout of the support and resistance
levels, you need to draw a similar line on the On Balance Volume chart.
If the OBV line also breaks through the levels, the breakout is true. If
it doesn’t, there is a false breakout. You should also remember that the
obv signals usually happen a few bars before the price movement.

The green lines in the chart mark the support levels to the price and
the OBV indicator. The red arrow marks the breakout point. The on volume
balance, however, is going down.

It means the smart money (large traders) do not take part in the price
movement. So, the trend is unlikely to continue, and the breakout is
false.

## How to Trade Forex with On Balance Volume Indicator

So, we have studied how the OBV indicator forex works, [how to](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-trading-how-to/) read OBV
signals, and [how to](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-trading-how-to/) interpret the on volume balance chart. Now, we shall
see [how to](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-trading-how-to/) trade the OBV in Forex. Traders use this indicator both to
predict the trend reversals and to confirm the trend continuation.

The [BTCUSD][3] chart above displays the common bearish divergence. It
signals the trend reversal. So, we open a short position after there is
a confirming signal.

We enter a trade when the first relatively long black candlestick
finishes. It is clear from the chart that the trendline is not broken
out, but the indicator already goes down at the bar’s close.

So, the indicator delivers the sell signal, and we can enter a short
trade (blue horizontal line).

A stop loss is set a little higher than the most recent local high (red
line).

A take profit is approximately equal to the stop loss (green line).

Soon, the [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) price drops sharply and crosses the take profit level,
and the trade is exited automatically.

There is also an alternative trading scenario. When the [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) price
goes down to the first target at the distance of the stop loss, we move
the stop loss to the breakeven.

To take the profit, we expect the reversal signal of the obv indicator
[bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/). The signal appears when the resistance level is broken out (red
section of the chart) and the classical bullish divergence (green
sections). The [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) obv indicator signal is confirmed when there
appears a long white candlestick (marked with the red arrow). When the
candlestick closes, we can exit the short trade and enter a long.

Let us explore [how to](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-trading-how-to/) trade trend reversals on the example of the
[IBM][4] shares.

The chart shows a clear divergence between the price chart. This bearish
divergence signals a soon trend reversal. The confining signal to enter
a short is when the [IBM][4] price goes below the trendline, and the
indicator breaks out the support level. Note, the On Balance Volume
serves as a filter and confirms the trendline breakout with a slight
delay.

When the signal is confirmed, we look at the difference between the
opening and closing prices. The next bar closes with a down gap, which
is another bear signal. We enter a short by market.

A stop loss is set according to the common principle, a little higher
than the local high (red line in the chart). We shall take the profit
manually when the opposite reversal signal appears. Thus we have a
higher risk of a loss, but the potential profit is also bigger this way.

As you see from the above chart, the [IBM][4] price goes down after we
enter a short. There is forming a bear wedge that signals a reversal.
Such a pattern usually ends with a bear divergence. The price is going
as expected.

I should note that the trendline breakout in the On Balance Volume
window occurs a little earlier than in the chart. I take the profit once
the breakout bar closes. I mark this bar with an arrow and the exit
point with a green line.

### Intraday Trading with OBV

Intraday trading is similar in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of spotting and reading the OBV
signals. The values of the OBV indicator do not depend on the period,
unlike other, more popular oscillators. The difference is in the
timeframes. Intraday on balance volume trading strategy suggests trading
in the charts from M5 to M30.

I take the [USDJPY][5] five-minute chart as an example.

There is a very unusual divergence when the indicator breaks through the
highs, but the price chart doesn’t. This divergence is not typical for a
bull trend. I can explain it with the features of the on balance volume.
Despite the high trading volume, the price doesn’t break through the
high, which means selling pressure from large traders.

Such type of divergence is quite common in the minutes’ charts, where
the trade volume in a short period is important.

All the rest with OBV intraday trading is the same as in the examples I
described above.

We are waiting for a confirmation signal from the price chart and on-
balance volume. The uptrend should change relative to the previous bars,
and the trend line will be broken. We enter a trade at the close of the
signal candlestick.

Due to the high volatility within the day and the abundance of false
signals, we set a take profit level at a fixed distance twice as long as
that of the stop loss. The stop loss is set at the local high.

In the case of the bullish reversal in intraday trading OBV, the
strategy is the same. The only difference is that the stop loss is set
at the local low.

The above chart displays a good example. There is an untypical
divergence. It looks like an expanding bullish formation. However, the
price breaks through the local lows in the expanding formation, and the
situation is the opposite in our example.

I should note that the OBV signals do not always work out; it is clear
in minute timeframes. The red circle marks such a false signal, where
the On Balance Volume line doesn’t react to the price rise. But the
uptrend continues.

### Trading with On Balance Volume OBV and Moving Average indicators

You can combine the On Balance Volume with other technical analysis
indicators to filter and confirm signals to buy or sell. This way, you
can increase the performance of your obv indicator strategy and have
more winning trades. You can use the OBV and [Stochastic][6] or trend
indicators. One of the trend indicators, the [Bollinger Bands](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/bollinger-bands.html) indicator,
is covered in this [article][1].

Now, I would like to give an example of a successful obv trading
strategy. It is the obv indicator with moving average mt4. You know that
the MA is a lagging indicator. To reduce the time lag, I recommend using
the [EMA][7] and the OBV indicators together.

To trade the MA and OBV forex strategy, you need to add two exponential
moving averages with periods 34 and 12.

Entry conditions:

  * The OBV diverges from the price chart. Or the price and the indicator line stop close to the support or resistance level.
  * To enter a buy trade, the EMA 12 should break through the EM 34 upside. To enter a sell trade, the fast EMA breaks the slow EMA downside.
  * The stop loss is set close to the next local high/low.
  * As the exponential moving average is an additional signal filter, I recommend setting the take profit at a distance equal to the stop loss. You can also exit the trade manually when the fast EMA breaks through the slow EMA in the opposite direction.

Let see how this strategy works on the example of the [EURUSD][8] chart:

The purple lines in the chart connect the highs of the candlesticks and
the OBV peaks. There is a divergence, and so, we can anticipate a trend
reversal.

The initial interpretation of the signal confirms the trend line
breakout in the on balance volume window. As expected, the fast EMA 12
breaks through the slow EMA 34 downside a little later (red circle).
When there opens the bar immediately after the crossing, we enter the
trade (blue horizontal line). A stop and loss and a take profit are set
according to the trading strategy rules (green line).

The sideways trend is indicative here, I marked it with the red oval.
You know that MAs often send false signals in trading flat, and this
results in a loss. OBV helps us avoid a loss.

It is clear from the above chart, the indicator does not rise during a
flat and does not cross the resistance level (the blue line). This
allows us to hold the position and the market and not to close it too
early.

As a result, the profit is taken at the TP level (green line).

## Advantages & Limitations of OBV Indicator

The OBV has some advantages and flaws we should consider when trading
with the on-balance volume indicator.

 **Advantages:**

  * The calculation formula is very simple, and it is easy to use.
  * The obv delivers diverse signals of trend continuation or trend reversal. They are the OBV line direction, divergence with the price chart, breakout of the important levels, or the trendline.
  * The time lag is very short if any. In most cases, the OBV signals are early.
  * The signals in medium-term timeframes are entirely accurate.
  * It doesn’t repaint.

 **OBV limitations:**

  * A surge in trading volume can result in an unreasonably sharp jump of the indicator and give a false signal.
  * It doesn’t suit low-volatility instruments with low trade volumes.
  * In short-term timeframes, the signals can be mixed by the natural volatility or the price noise. In this case, the On Balance Volume can send false signals.
  * You need a long trading [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) to carry out the market analysis effectively. 

 _ **Important!**_

 _The On Balance Volume doesn’t consider the strength of the price move.
It could be an advantage in some cases. For example, the signals are not
distorted by the new releases. In other cases, it is a limitation._

 _For example, if the sharp price rise is confirmed by a hardly
noticeable move of the OBV line, an inexperienced trade could see it as
a reversal signal._

## Recommendations on trading with the OBV

Considering the OBV indicator description and the above information, I
want to sum up and give some tips on using the On Balance Indicator:

  * Take advantage of the instrument, filter false reversal signals, check the trend strength.
  * Сonsider all divergences in the OBV indicator and the price chart, not just common divergences. Also, use breakouts of the key levels and other chart patterns in the Balance Volume window.
  * OBV oscillator is a good complement to both trend indicators of technical analysis and oscillators. If your strategy doesn't take volume readings into account, this tool can be a great addition.
  * Avoid using indicator signals on low liquid assets and short timeframes. Do not use it on timeframes less than M15.
  * On Balance Volume is efficient for different investment assets: currency pairs, cryptocurrency, stocks. But it is ineffective in short timeframes due to price noise. Therefore, professionals prefer to trade the OBV on charts of M15 and longer.
  * OBV signals cannot be the basis of a trading strategy and must be confirmed by signals from other technical analysis tools.

The On Balance Volume is not that popular among technical analysts and
traders. The signals are not clear at first sight; you need to be able
to spot signals and interpret them correctly. So, do not waste time and
open a demo account in a couple of clicks. Apply the information from
the article to practice to develop your skills and start trading like a
professional.
