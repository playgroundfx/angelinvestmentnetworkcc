Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 19.10.2020Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I suggest entry signals
to trade each cryptocurrency.

At the moment, all the major cryptocurrency pairs continue rising in the
final fifth wave. Thus, I recommend looking for longs.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

 ****

Bitcoin continues forming the final wave (Y) of the double zigzag. It is
composed of sub-waves A-B-C. At the moment, we see the last bullish wave
C forming which take the form of a five-wave impulse consisting of sub-
waves [1]-[2]-[3]-[4]-[5]. There are fully formed sub-waves
[1]-[2]-[3]-[4]. The final wave [5] has recently started developing.
Most likely, the growth will continue to the level of 12062. This is the
maximum which was set by the upward corrective wave (B).

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 11444.25, TP 12062.00

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

In the last section of the chart, we see corrective wave B forming,
which is part of the descending triangle A-B-C. Wave B takes the form of
a simple zigzag [a]-[b]-[c]. An impulse wave [c] is currently
developing. Its corrective wave (4) seems to have completed its pattern;
it is a double three. In the near future, we will see the price rise in
wave (5) to the level of 0.260. At this level, the magnitude of the
entire correction B will be 38.2% along the Fibonacci lines from the
bearish impulse A.

### Trading plan for **[XRPUSD][2]** today:

Buy 0.240, TP 0.260

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

 ****

ETHUSD continues to build a downtrend, which takes the form of a zigzag
A-B-C. Corrective wave B, which has an extended structure of a double
zigzag [W]-[X]-[Y], has not yet been fully completed. Now wave [Y] is
forming as the last part part of the indicated figure - bullish impulse
(C). Most likely, in the short term, the market will move up in wave 5
to the level of 394.20, which is the previous high marked by wave [W].

### Trading plan  **[ETHUSD][3] **today:

Buy 372.88, TP 394.20
