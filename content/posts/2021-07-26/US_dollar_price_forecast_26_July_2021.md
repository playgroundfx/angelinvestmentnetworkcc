Dollar is to face a storm. Forecast as of 26.07.2021Dmitri Demidenko

This week [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s expect the publications of the GDP and inflation
data in the USA and the euro area, the Fed meeting, and the IMF
forecasts. The last week of July is busy in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of economic events, so
increased [EURUSD][1] volatility is expected. Let us discuss the Forex
outlook and make up a trading plan.

## Weekly US dollar fundamental forecast

Markets are convinced that the delta variant of COVID-19 will not hinder
the US economic recovery. However, some [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s prefer to be cautious.
According to BofA, net purchases of bonds by global hedge funds
increased by $8.4 billion in the week ended July 21. Among stock, the
most demanded were technology and healthcare. Reflation trade seems to
be much over and needs to be reversed, so the Fed has a reason to
suspend the tapering of the monetary stimulus.

According to Wall Street Journal forecasts, the US GDP was up by 8.5% in
the second quarter and exceeded $19.2 trillion recorded in late 2019.
The OECD believes that at the end of 2022, the US economy will be even
larger than it could have been without a pandemic due to the fiscal
stimulus. However, the US economic data have been rather disappointing
recently, which is reflected in the decline of the economic surprise
index and lower Treasury yields.

Another evidence of the US economic downturn is the PMI data. The
composite purchasing managers index fell short of the forecast of 63.7
for the second consecutive month, declining to 59.7 in July, although it
remains [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/)ly high. In the euro area, conversely, the PMI
increased to 60.6, up from the previous 59.6. This has been the best
performance in 2021, preventing the [EURUSD][1] from falling below
1.1755. I think [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s should not be confused by such positive data.
First, most of the success is related to the services sector, while the
manufacturing sector is slowing down. Second, business expectations for
the year ahead dipped to a five-month low, down from an all-time high in
June

The Delta variant and economic problems allow the ECB to maintain the
monetary stimulus. Likewise, the same problems could increase the number
of FOMC doves. The latter claim that the USA is far behind full
employment, and the inflation surge should be temporary. Furthermore,
new strains of COVID-19 increase uncertainty.

It could seem that the US dollar should strengthen amid a busy economic
[calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) this week, but things are not that simple. The talks about
tapering the US QE, the GDP rise to 8.5%, and continuous PCE rally can
well encourage the [EURUSD][1] bears. Nonetheless, the Fed has reasons
to be patient, and the euro-area economy features quite an improvement.

### Weekly [EURUSD][1] trading plan

This week is going to be busy in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of economic events, and the
[EURUSD][1] is likely to jump up and down. As long as the euro is below
$1.1825, bears control the market. The price could break out the support
at 1.1755 and continue falling. If the euro goes up to $1.1825, it could
be further corrected up to $1.188. In this case, after short-term
purchases, it will be relevant to enter short trades on the price
rebound from the resistance levels.
