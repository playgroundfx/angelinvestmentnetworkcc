Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 26.07.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

Ethereum and Ripple are rising in the bullish impulses, which have not
yet completed and should continue unfolding.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

The BTCUSD market is developing the corrective wave [B] as a double
zigzag (W)-(X)-(Y). The first two legs of this formation, sub-waves (W)
and (X) have completed. There is now unfolding the bullish wave (Y) as a
zigzag A-B-C. Impulse wave A seems to have completed. Therefore, there
should be developing correction B and impulse C, as outlined in the
chart. The C wave should be shorter than the A wave and finish at a
level of around 38910.00, where wave (Y) will be 123.6% of wave (W).

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 38246.00, TP 38910.00

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

The XRPUSD market continues forming the horizontal pattern as a flat
A-B-C. Wave A is a zigzag [A]-[B]-[C]. Corrective wave B is a triple
zigzag [W]-[X]-[Y]-[X]-[Z]. Wave C, like in all flats, has the impulse
structure; it has not yet finished. There is now unfolding the middle
leg of the final sub-wave [5] in the C impulse, that is sub-wave (3).
Wave (3) should end at a level of around 0.667. After the indicated
level is reached by the price, the price should be corrected down in
sub-wave (4). Afterwards, the market will resume rising in the final
sub-wave (5), as outlined in the chart.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] **** today:

Buy 0.647, TP 0.667

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

The ETHUSD market continues rising in corrective wave B, which is
unfolding as a zigzag [A]-[B]-[C]. Wave [A] is a leading diagonal,
corrective wave [B] is a bearish triple zigzag (W)-(X)-(Y)-(XX)-(Z). The
market is now rising in the final impulse wave [C]. The price should be
soon corrected down in a small sub-wave (4) and continue rising in sub-
wave (5), as outlined in the chart. The entire wave [C] should end at a
level of 2425.00, where wave [C] will be equal to wave [A].

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Buy 2295.63, TP 2425.00
