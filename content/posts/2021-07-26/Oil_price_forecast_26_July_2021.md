Oil is not exhausted. Forecast as of 26.07.2021Dmitri Demidenko

There is a growing sentiment in the market that the [best time](https://www.fixpro.org/post/forex-best-time-to-trade/)s for the
US economy and oil are over. The first reached its peak in April-June,
which cannot but affect black stuff. How? Let us discuss the Forex
outlook and make up a [Brent][1] trading plan

## Quarterly oil fundamental forecast

Oil is rightly called the world economy's health indicator. When the US
faced a 2-month recession in 2020, the value of WTI fell below zero for
the first time in [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/). Then a rapid recovery began. In 2021,
[Brent][1] and [WTI][2] added 50% to their value against the backdrop of
a rapid increase in demand, a rapid reduction in reserves accumulated
during last year's lockdowns, efficient OPEC+ activity and a shortage in
the physical asset market. In mid-summer, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s' optimism began to
fade, but how quickly the crowd is buying out the fall suggests that the
oil hasn't been exhausted.

As the Delta spreads across the planet, China uses an administrative
power to restrain price growth, OPEC+ increases production, the Fed
talks about withdrawing monetary stimulus, contributing to the USD
strengthening, and the number of Baker Hughes drilling rigs peaks since
April 2020, signaling a recovery of U.S. manufacturers, you start to
wonder if the time has come for [Brent][1] and [WTI][2] correction?
That, in fact, oil did, dropping at the end of the second decade of July
by 10% from the recent highs.

The bears did not rejoice for long. A rapid decline was replaced by an
equally fast rally amid BofA forecasts of a price rise to $100 per
barrel and a number of optimistic [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/). [Brent][1] at a price below $ 70
is cheap, therefore the number of buyers is increasing, however, such
changes lead to increased volatility, making us doubt the bright future
for oil. It is unlikely that it will be able to grow as fast as it did
in the first half of the year.

### Dynamics of oil volatility

 _Source: Wall Street Journal._

While COVID-19 infection rates have reached 2-month highs and curfews
and other restrictions are being imposed in Asia, it is highly doubtful
that the US and Europe will return to lockdowns. The demand for gasoline
in the US has already fully recovered, oil reserves continue to decline,
the volume of passenger air traffic in Europe is 2/3 of the pre-pandemic
level, and an increase of 400 thousand bpd per month to the previous
OPEC+ production is a drop in the ocean. Moreover, OPEC+ can revise its
strategy at any time.

As for China, which sold 22 million barrels of strategic reserves and
introduced tough measures regarding the use of import quotas by oil
refiners, these are most likely temporary difficulties. Usage of
administrative power cannot break the market, sooner or later it will
return to the trend.

### Quarterly [Brent][3] trading plan

In my opinion, the time of volatility has come to the oil market. The
pullbacks are getting deeper, the rally is not as rapid as before, the
risks of consolidation are growing. However, who said that under such
conditions it is impossible to make money on oil? Buy cheaper, sell
more. This principle is more relevant than ever. I do not support BofA
and do not believe that [Brent][1] will be trading at $100 per barrel
(at least not this year), but I do not refuse the [previously][4] set
targets in the zone of ​​$80-85. The recommendation for Brent is to buy
on price falls.
