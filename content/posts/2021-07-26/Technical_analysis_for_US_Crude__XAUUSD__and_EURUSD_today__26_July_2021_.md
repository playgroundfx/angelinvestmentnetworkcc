Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 26.07.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

Right from the opening of the trading session on Monday, the oil began
to correct to a short-term uptrend.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

Right from the opening of the trading session on Monday, the oil began
to correct to a short-term uptrend. At the moment, the traders are
testing the strong support Additional Zone 70.83 - 70.70. If the zone is
held, then enter oil purchases with a target at the day's high.

If the Additional Zone is broken out, then it will be possible to enter
sales with the target in the Intermediary Zone 69.47 - 69.20.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

Buy according to the pattern in Additional Zone 70.83 - 70.70.
TakeProfit: 72.10. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

Gold is correcting to a short-term downtrend. The target of the
correction is the Intermediary Zone 1814 - 1812. As part of the
correction, the traders reached a strong resistance level 1809, which
can stop the price growth for some time.

Today it is profitable to look for gold purchases in the zone of 1803 -
1796 with a target at the day's high + Intermediary Zone.

It will be possible to sell gold after the breakout of support level
1795.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

Buy in the zone of 1803 - 1796. TakeProfit: 1809, Intermediary Zone 1814
- 1812. StopLoss: 1794.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

Last week the euro traders were unable to break out the strong support
of 1.1762 - 1.1753. If the price doesn't decline, then sooner or later
it will go up. This is a market law. Now the price is rising and
correcting to a short-term downtrend.

As part of the correction, the traders are breaking out the Micro-zone
1.1778 - 1.1776. Therefore, expect a further price movement to the
Additional Zone 1.1803 - 1.1798. Look for Euro purchases.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

It will be relevant to wait for the price consolidation above level
1.1780 to enter purchases. TakeProfit: Additional Zone 1.1803 - 1.1798.
StopLoss: below the nearest local low, or at level 1.1771.
