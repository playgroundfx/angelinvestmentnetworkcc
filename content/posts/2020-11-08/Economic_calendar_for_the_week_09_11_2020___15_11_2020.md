Economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the week 09.11.2020 – 15.11.2020Jana Kane

##  **Review of the main events of the Forex economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the
next trading week (09.11.2020 – 15.11.2020)**

 **Trading on key Forex [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/): next week we are expecting the publication
of important macro statistics from China, Great Britain, Germany, the
US, as well as the results of the meeting of the central bank of New
Zealand.**

An extremely eventful week has ended. The US stock indices rose again,
and despite the decline on Friday, the last week was the most successful
period for them since April. In the United States, counting of votes
continues, and Trump has promised to sue right up to the Supreme Court.
Uncertainty around the US presidential election is likely to hold back
the further growth of stock indexes for some time, which will give the
dollar a respite after its strongest decline in the previous days.

At the same time, the number of cases of Covid-19 in the United States
continues to grow, and difficulties may arise in the matter of approving
additional stimulus measures.

These two factors, even if Biden wins, could slow the growth of stock
indices and force [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s to pay attention to the defensive dollar
again.

Next week, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s will pay attention to the publication of important
macro statistics from China, Great Britain, Germany, the United States,
as well as the results of the meeting of the central bank of New
Zealand.

 **Traders should pay attention to the publication of the following
macro indicators:**

 ***during the coming week, new events may be added to the [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) and
/ or some scheduled events may be canceled**

###  **10:35 GBP Speech by the Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey**

In his speech, Andrew Bailey, who took over as Governor of the Bank of
England on March 16, 2020, replacing Mark Carney, will likely clarify
the bank's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) decision last week. It is likely that he will
also touch on the state and prospects of the British economy, which has
been badly affected by the coronavirus pandemic and is on the verge of
Brexit, which can still happen without a trade deal.

Financial market participants will also expect him to clarify the
situation regarding the further [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the UK central bank. If Andrew
Bailey gives any hints about tightening or easing of the Bank of
England's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) in the near future, volatility will sharply
increase in the quotes of the pound and the London Stock Exchange FTSE
index during his speech. If he does not touch upon the issues of
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), the reaction to his speech will be weak.

###  **01:30 CNY Consumer Price Index (CPI)**

The National Bureau of Statistics of China will release another monthly
report reflecting the dynamics of consumer prices in China. Rising
consumer prices could trigger an acceleration in inflation, which could
force the People's Bank of China to take measures aimed at tightening
fiscal [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). Increased growth in consumer inflation may cause
appreciation of the yuan, a weak result will put pressure on the yuan.

China's economy is the second largest in the world after America's.
Therefore, the publication of important macroeconomic indicators of this
country has a noticeable impact on world financial markets, primarily on
the positions of the yuan, other Asian currencies, the dollar, commodity
currencies, as well as on Chinese and Asian stock indices. China is the
largest buyer of raw materials and supplier of a wide range of finished
products to the world commodity market.

In January 2020, the growth of the consumer inflation index amounted to
+1.4% (+5.4% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)), and in May - the value of the CPI index
decreased to -0.8% (+2.4% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)).

Deterioration in macroeconomic indicators, including a decrease in
consumer inflation, may negatively affect the positions of the yuan, as
well as commodity currencies such as the Canadian, Australian, and New
Zealand dollars. To a greater extent, this applies to the Australian
dollar, since China is Australia's largest trade and economic partner.

According to the forecast, another acceleration in the growth rate of
the Consumer Price Index is expected in October: +0.3% (+1.8% in annual
[terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) against +0.2% (+1.7% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) in the previous month.

The rise in the consumer inflation index will have a positive effect on
the quotes of the yuan, as well as commodity currencies, primarily the
Australian dollar. However, the relative decline in CPI may negatively
affect them.

###  **07:00 GBP Report on the average wages of the British citizens for
the last 3 months. Unemployment rate**

On a monthly basis, the UK Office for National Statistics (ONS)
publishes a report on average earnings covering the last 3 months with
bonuses and without bonuses.

This report is a key short-term indicator of the dynamics of changes in
the level of wages of employees in the UK. Wages growth is positive for
the GBP, while a low reading is negative. Forecast: November report
suggests that average wages with bonuses increased over the last
calculated 3 months (July-September) by +0.6% (against 0%, -1.0%, -1.2%,
-0.3%, +1.0%, +2.4%, +2.8%, +3.1%, +2.9%, +3.2%, +3.2% in previous
periods); without bonuses - increased by +1.2% (against +0.8%, +0.2%,
-0.2%, +0.7%, +1.7%, +2.7%, +2.9%, +3.1%, +3.2%, +3.4%, +3.5% in
previous periods). Thus, the expected data is still below the average.
If the data turns out to be better than forecast, the pound is likely to
strengthen in the foreign exchange market in the short term. The data
worse than the forecast will negatively affect the pound.

Also at this time, data on unemployment in the UK are published. It is
expected that in the 3 months from July to September, unemployment was
at 4.3% (against 4.5%, 4.1%, 3.9%, 3.9%, 3.9%, 3.9%, 4.0%, 3.9% and 3.8%
in previous periods). Since 2012, the UK unemployment rate has steadily
declined (from 8.0% in September 2012). This is a positive factor for
the pound, while unemployment growth is a negative factor.

If the data from the UK labor market turn out to be worse than the
forecast and / or the previous value, the pound will be under pressure.

In any case, at the time of the publication of data from the British
labor market, an increase in volatility in the pound quotes and on the
London Stock Exchange is expected.

###  **01:00 NZD The Reserve Bank of New Zealand's interest rate
decision. Accompanying statement**

After the bank's management decided to cut the rate by 0.75% at once
during an unscheduled meeting on March 15, the current interest rate of
the RB of New Zealand is at 0.25%. The bank's management explained its
decision by a loss of momentum in the New Zealand economy and a sharp
slowdown in the global economy amid the coronavirus pandemic.

"Global economic activity continues to weaken, reducing demand for goods
and services from New Zealand. Increased uncertainty and contraction in
international trade are contributing to a decline in economic growth in
trading partner countries," a recent statement from the RBNZ said.

The RBNZ believes that wage growth remains weak. At the same time,
inflationary expectations are falling, and low levels of business
confidence indicate a slowdown in hiring and wages growth.

Restrained economic growth (New Zealand's GDP growth has slowed since
the second half of 2018) and a weakening labor market, as well as
escalating international trade wars and a worsening global economic
outlook, are forcing the Reserve Bank of New Zealand to keep interest
rates low. An additional and unforeseen risk for the global and New
Zealand economies is the global coronavirus epidemic.

It is expected that at this meeting, the RBNZ will not begin to reduce
or raise the rate yet, but may speak in favor of lowering it in the
coming months if the economic situation in the country and in the world
worsens.

In an accompanying statement, the RBNZ management will provide an
explanation of the decision on the interest rate and comments on the
economic conditions that facilitated this decision.

At this time, the volatility in the quotations of the New Zealand dollar
may rise sharply.

Earlier, the RBNZ stated that against the background of "many factors of
uncertainty" monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) "will remain soft for the foreseeable
future," but "may be adjusted accordingly." According to the bank's
management, for the stable recovery of the New Zealand economy and the
growth of inflation, "a lower rate of the New Zealand dollar is
necessary."

Head of the RBNZ Adrian Orr is likely reaffirm the bank's intention to
pursue a soft monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), which will lead to continued pressure on
the New Zealand currency.

###  **02:00** **NZD Press conference of the RBNZ**

During the press conference, head of the RBNZ Adrian Orr will give an
explanation of the bank's decision. His speeches often serve as an
unofficial source of information on the future direction of the RBNZ's
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). In his opinion, the country's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) should
correlate with the dynamics of employment and financial stability of the
state.

Earlier, the RBNZ stated that against the background of "many factors of
uncertainty" monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) "will remain soft for the foreseeable
future," but "may be adjusted accordingly." For a stable recovery of the
New Zealand economy and rising inflation, "a weaker NZ dollar is
needed."

It is likely that the head of the RBNZ Adrian Orr will reaffirm the
bank's intention to pursue a soft monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), which will lead to
continued pressure on the New Zealand currency.

In any case, volatility is expected to increase in the New Zealand
dollar trade during the RBNZ press conference.

###  **07:00 GBP UK GDP in the 3rd quarter (preliminary release)**

GDP is considered an indicator of the overall health of the British
economy. The growing trend in GDP is considered positive for the GBP.
The UK's GDP was one of the highest in the world until 2016, when the
Brexit referendum was held. Then its growth slowed down, and with the
onset of the global coronavirus pandemic, the growth rate of British GDP
completely moved into negative territory.

The UK's annual GDP is forecast to decline by -20.5% in Q3 2020 (after
zero in Q4 2019 and a decline of -19.8% in Q2 2020). Falling GDP is a
negative factor for the GBP, and the situation seems to be getting
worse.

The main factors that can force the Bank of England to keep rates low
are weak GDP and labor market growth, as well as low consumer spending.
If the GDP data coincide with the preliminary negative estimate of
-20.5%, it will put downward pressure on the pound. Strong GDP report
will strengthen the pound. But it can hardly be expected in the current
situation.

###  **07:00 EUR Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices  (HICP) in Germany
(final release)**

This index is published by the EU Statistical Office and is calculated
based on a statistical method agreed upon among all EU countries. It is
an indicator for assessing inflation and is used by the Governing
Council of the ECB to assess the level of price stability. A positive
result strengthens the EUR, a negative one weakens it.

In May, the HICP index (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) increased by +0.5%, in June by
+0.8%, in July - by 0%, and in September it decreased by -0.5%. Forecast
for October: -0.4%. Since this is the second, final estimate, which is
not much better than the first estimate, the euro is unlikely to react
strongly to the publication of this indicator. If the data turn out to
be better than the forecast, the euro may strengthen in the short term.
The growth of the indicator is a positive factor for the euro. The data
suggests that inflationary pressures are still low in Germany. The data
worse than the forecast and the previous value will negatively affect
the euro.

###  **08:00 GBP Speech by the Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey**

In his speech, Andrew Bailey is likely to touch on the state and
prospects of the British economy, which has been badly affected by the
coronavirus pandemic and is on the verge of Brexit, which can still
happen without a trade deal.

Financial market participants will also expect him to clarify the
situation regarding the further [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the UK central bank. If Andrew
Bailey gives any hints about tightening or easing of the Bank of
England's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) in the near future, volatility during his
speech will sharply increase in the quotes of the pound and the London
Stock Exchange FTSE index. If he does not touch upon the issues of
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), the reaction to his speech will be weak.

###  **12:30 USD Consumer Price Index (ex food and energy products)**

Consumer Price Index (CPI) determines the change in prices of a selected
basket of goods and services for a given period and is a key indicator
for assessing inflation and changes in consumer preferences. Food and
energy have been excluded from this indicator to provide a more accurate
estimate. A high value strengthens the US dollar, while a low score
weakens it. In January the value of the indicator was +0.2% (+2.3% in
annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)), in February +0.2% and +2.4% (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)), in March
-0.1% (+2.1% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)), in April -0.4% (+1.4% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)).
Forecast for October: +0.2% and +1.8% (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)), which indicates
some improvement in the situation after the fall of the index in March
and April. If October data turns out to be weaker than forecast, the
dollar is likely to react with a short-term strong decline. Better-than-
forecast data will strengthen the dollar.

###  **Friday, November 13**

###  **09:00 EUR Eurozone GDP for the 3rd quarter (second estimate)**

GDP is considered to be an indicator of the overall health of the
Eurozone economy. A growing trend in GDP is considered positive for the
EUR; a low result weakens the EUR.

Recently, macro data from the Eurozone have been showing a gradual
recovery in the European economy after a sharp drop earlier this year.
The decision made by the EU leaders in July on additional economic
support (a package of expenditures for the recovery of the bloc's
economy in the amount of 1.8 trillion euros was approved) will help
stabilize the economy of the Eurozone, which, as a result of quarantine
restrictions, restraint in spending by companies and consumers, as well
as the collapse of exports on the cusp of its deepest economic downturn
since World War II.

The euro reacted positively to this decision. According to economists'
forecast, Eurozone GDP is expected to grow by +12.7% in the 3rd quarter
(and a decrease by -4.3% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) after falling by -11.8%
(-14.7% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) in Q2 and a decline of -3.6% (-3.1% YoY) in Q1
2020. This is significantly better than the preliminary forecast, which
assumed that the Eurozone's GDP in the 3rd quarter would fall by -14.1%
(-16.9% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)).

If the data turn out to be weaker than the preliminary estimate (+12.7%
and a decrease of -4.3% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)), the euro may fall. Data better
than the first estimate may strengthen the euro in the short term,
although there is still a long way to a full recovery of the European
economy even to pre-crisis levels (quarterly growth within 0.2% - 0.4%).

###  **15:00 USD University of Michigan Consumer Confidence Index
(preliminary release)**

This indicator reflects the confidence of American consumers in the
country's economic development. A high level indicates economic growth,
while a low level indicates stagnation. Previous indicator values: 99.8
in January, 101.1 in February, 89.1 in March, 71.8 in April, 72.3 in
May, 78.1 in June, 72.5 in July, 74.1 in August, 80.4 in September, 81.8
in October. An increase in the indicator will strengthen the USD, while
a decrease in the value will weaken the dollar. This indicator is
expected to be released in November with a value of 82.0. There is still
a weak trend towards a gradual recovery in the growth of the indicator.
Data worse than the forecast may negatively affect the dollar in the
short term.

###  **16:00 GBP Speech by the Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey**

In his speech, Andrew Bailey is likely to touch on the state and
prospects of the British economy, which has been badly affected by the
coronavirus pandemic and is on the verge of Brexit, which can still
happen without a trade deal.

Financial market participants will also expect him to clarify the
situation regarding the further [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the UK central bank. If Andrew
Bailey gives any hints about tightening or easing of the Bank of
England's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) in the near future, volatility during his
speech will sharply increase in the quotes of the pound and the London
Stock Exchange FTSE index. If he does not touch upon the issues of
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), the reaction to his speech will be weak.
