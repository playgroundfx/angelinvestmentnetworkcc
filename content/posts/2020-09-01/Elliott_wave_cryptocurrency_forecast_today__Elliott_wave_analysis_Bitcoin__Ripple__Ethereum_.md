##  **Elliott wave forecast for BTCUSD, ETHUSD, XRPUSD for today**

analysis Bitcoin, Ripple, Ethereum.][2]**

The BTCUSD chart is forming the global impulse wave A that is composed
of five sub-waves [1]-[2]-[3]-[4]-[5]. There is unfolding the final wave
[5] also as an impulse. It is clear from the H2 time frame that the
sideways corrective wave (4) completed as a triple three. Next, the
market has started moving down in the initial element of the final wave
(5). Most likely, the price will be rising in the sub-waves 3-4-5 to a
level of 12600, as it is outlined in the chart.

The XRPUSD market is also forming the long-term upward impulse wave. The
first four legs completed within the (C) impulse. The corrective wave 4
finished as a double three [w]-[x]-[y]. The market is now forming the
initial element of the final wave 5. There have finished only two sub-
waves of wave 5. So, the price should be rising in the sub-waves
[3]-[4]-[5] to a level of 0.338 in the next few weeks.

The current structure of the ETHUSD chart suggests that the market is
forming the long-term upward impulse wave C that is composed of five
sub-waves. The down corrective wave [4] is likely to have completed as a
simple zigzag (A)-(B)-(C). The price is now rising in the final impulse
[5]. The Ethereum price is likely to reach the level of 460.00 soon. At
this level, the entire uptrend could end.
