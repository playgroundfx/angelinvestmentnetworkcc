Analysis for oil, gold and, EUR/USD for 01.09.2020Alex Rodionov

##  **Oil price forecast** **for** **today:** ** **USCrude****
******analysis**

Oil continues growing in value and hits new local high in the medium-
term uptrend. The buy target is Target Zone 6 [49.17 – 48.42]. Hold up
long trades entered in the broken-out TZ 5 and enter new purchases on
the correction to the trend key support [37.34 — 36.72].

The short-term oil trend is up. The primary upside target is Gold Zone
[45.04 – 44.67]. The intermediate target is the zone of ½ of the whole
margin, drawn up from the low of August 7.

In the previous trading recommendations, I suggested buying in the
broken-out Additional Zone [42.70 - 42.55] and in the new one [42.00 -
41.84]. Today, I recommend holding the purchases up to the target or
entering new ones according to the pattern in the zone of [42.00 –
41.84].

It is not relevant to sell oil now.

##  **Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis**

Gold price broke out the flat zone [1958 – 1913] upside. When the price
is corrected down to level [1958 – 1949], it will be relevant to open
middle-term buy positions with a target at the high of August 18 and
Target Zone 2 [2044.9 — 2036.2].

The short-term trend is up. The price is now getting close to the trend
target, Target Zone [2005.1 – 1995.8]. Today, I suggest entering
purchases on the correction in the strong support zone:

  1. Additional Zone [1966.6 - 1964.3]

  2. Intermediary Zone [1943.4 - 1938.7].

Expect the test of the above zones and look for a buy pattern. It will
be relevant to sell gold when at least one of the support zones is
broken out with the consolidation below.

Today, we shall see if buyers will consolidate the price above Target

It is relevant to enter new purchases according to the patterns in the
strong support zones on the correction. The intermediate target will be
today’s high.
