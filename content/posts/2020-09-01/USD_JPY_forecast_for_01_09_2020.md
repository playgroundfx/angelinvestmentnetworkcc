USD/JPY forecast: Yen accepts the resignationDmitri Demidenko

## Fundamental Yen forecast for today

### Shinzo Abe is no longer the Japanese Prime Minister, but “Abenomics”
should continue

The Fed’s decision to change the inflation target for the first time
since 2012 was not the last market shock of summer. Shinzo Abe has
announced his resignation for health reasons after eight years of
serving as the Japanese Prime Minister. Abenomics, based upon “three
arrows” of monetary easing, is one of the world’s most famous economic
management strategies. Investors are concerned that the new prime
minister will continue the economic policies advocated by Shinzo Abe.
The increased demand for safe havens has sent the [USD/JPY][1] down to
the bottom of figure 105.

During the term of Shinzo Abe, the capitalization of TOPIX doubled, and
unemployment fell to its lowest level over 25 years. Nonetheless, other
global stock indices grew even faster, and the drop in unemployment is
associated, first of all, with the reduction in the labor force. 25% of
the Japanese population is aged 65 or above. Older people in Japan
should make up 80% of its total working population. Aged people prefer
saving to spending, which will weigh on the inflation rate. The
fruitless struggle to raise consumer prices has become a typical feature
of Abenomics.

I do not think the official Tokyo will abandon Abenomics. A strong
contender to succeed Abe as prime minister is Yoshihide Suga, a longtime
lieutenant of Shinzo Abe. I do not think the Bank of Japan will cease to
control the yield curve. If the BoJ cuts the interest rates, it will
damage the bank system, which already faces an increase in problem loans
due to the pandemic.

Therefore, Abe’s resignation is likely to be one-time political [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/).
The flows of investment capitals should determine the USD/JPY further
trend. Thus, Warren Buffett’s decision to increase the share of Japanese
companies in the portfolio to 5% with the prospect of growth to 9.9%
looks much more significant for Forex than the departure of Japan’s
prime minister. The US stock market is costly in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of P/E compared
to the Japanese peer.

According to Goldman Sachs, foreign [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s will spend $300 billion to
buy the US equities in 2020. The Japanese [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are the largest
holders. If [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s, following Buffett, buy Asian securities, the
[USD/JPY][1] downtrend will continue. Societe Generale and Eisuke
Sakakibara, known as Mr. Yen for his ability to influence the exchange
rate in the late 1990s, believe the [USD/JPY][1] could drop to 100. In
my opinion, the dollar will continue falling versus the yen if the US
jobs report is weak, and the pair breaks out the support at 105.2.
