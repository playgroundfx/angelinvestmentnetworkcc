Analysis for oil, gold, and EUR/USD for 13.04.2020Alex Rodiоnov

###  **USCrude –** **oil** ****

Oil middle-term uptrend continues. The buy target in the trend is Target
Zone 2 [30.75 – 30.19].

The trend key support is in the zone of [23.29 - 22.73]. The price is
now testing this support. It is time to look for buy entries.

The short-term is down. The price reached Target Zone [23.29 – 22.73] in
the downtrend. The trading idea to sell oil in the zone of [25.81 –
26.86] has worked out.

It will be relevant to sell again when Target Zone is broken out
downside. In this case, the target will be Gold Zone [20.49 – 20.21].

It will be relevant to sell oil in the short-term when the price breaks
out Intermediary Zone [25.61 - 25.28]. The target will be the upper
Target Zone [29.30 — 28.63].

###  **XAUUSD – gold**

Gold price reached Target Zone 4 [1697.2 – 1691.2] last week. The price
is now testing this resistance. If the price breaks this zone and
consolidates above, the next target in the trend will be Target Zone 5
[1757.2 — 1751.2].

![LiteForex: Analysis for oil, gold, and EUR/USD for 13.04.2020][4]

The short-term trend is up. Today, Gold Zone [1697.7 – 1693.5] was
reached at the beginning of the session. We shall see if the buyers will
break this zone out in the next few days. If they do, the next target
will Target Zone 2 [1743.6 – 1735.3].

I suggest looking for new purchases on the correction in the trend key
support [1651.6 – 1647.5] or Additional Zone [1672.5 - 1670.4]. The
target can be set at the local high.

The trend will reverse down, and it will be relevant to sell when the
price consolidates below Intermediary Zone.

###  **EURUSD – euro/dollar**

The EUR/USD is testing the border of the medium-term down trend [1.0957
– 1.0940]. Look for sell trades at the beginning of the week with a
target at the low that is in Target Zone 2 [1.0803 - 1.0786]. If the
trend key resistance is broken out, we shall start buying the instrument
with a target in the upper Target Zone 2 [1.1129 — 1.1112].

![LiteForex: Analysis for oil, gold, and EUR/USD for 13.04.2020][7]

The short-term EUR/USD trend is up. Traders are breaking out Target Zone
[1.0957 – 1.0940]. If the US session closes the price above the zone,
the next upside target is Gold Zone [1.1035 – 1.1026].

Today, I suggest looking for buy entries on the correction in the string
support zones:

  1. Additional Zone [1.0923 - 1.0918].

  2. Intermediary Zone [1.0880 — 1.0871].

The target will be at the local high of the day.

 **[EURUSD][9] Trading ideas for today: **

  1. Buy according to the pattern in Additional Zone [1.0923 - 1.0918]. TakeProfit: 1.0964. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. Buy according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone [1.0880 - 1.0871]. TakeProfit: 1.0964. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

breakout.
