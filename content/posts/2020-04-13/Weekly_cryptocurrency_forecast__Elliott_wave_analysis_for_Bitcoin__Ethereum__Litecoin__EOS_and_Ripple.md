[W]-[X]-[Y]. The sub-wave [W] and the linking wave [X] have completed,
they are simple zigzags. The bear impulse wave [Y] is now developing. It
is likely to finish as a double zigzag (W)-(X)-(Y). Let see the most
recent portion of the chart in more detail in the eight-hour timeframe.

waves (W) and (X) have completed, wave (Y) is still unfolding. It is
likely to complete as a simple zigzag A-B-C. Wave A is a simple five-
