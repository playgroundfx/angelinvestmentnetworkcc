Dollar has a long, hard road to goDmitri Demidenko

## Is a V-shaped recovery of the US economy impossible?

Who will pay for the party? According to Goldman Sachs, it will require
to issue $3 billion of Treasuries to fund the coronavirus aid package
approved by Congress to support households, companies and local
governments. The major buyer of the newly issued debt will be the Fed
that committed itself to buy an unlimited quantity of Treasuries. Such
interference may result in a substantial distortion of the asset prices,
however, the Fed’s officials have their point of view. According to
Cleveland Fed president, Loretta Mester, Fed has worked at making sure
markets can function normally, rather than at regulating the prices. The
markets were ruined and destroyed, and the Fed has spent every effort to
bring the markets to normal functioning.

Deep wounds leave scars. Of course, Donald Trump wants the US economy to
rebound quickly after the victory over the pandemic, but the real things
are likely to be different. Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank President
Neel Kashkari, the U.S. economic recovery from the disruptions caused by
the coronavirus outbreak will likely be a “long, hard road” in which
some parts of the economy will periodically shut down and restart.

One of the scars could be low risk appetite featured by young [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s.
As the events of 1929, 1974 and 2000 prove, it took a long time for the
S&P 500 to completely compensate its losses. Over a few years following
the crisis, the share of stocks in investment portfolios was shrinking,
just like [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s’ interest in risky projects, including starting
their enterprise.

The current recession should be the deepest since the Great Depression
of the 1930s. This is signaled by the Brookings-FT tracking index, or
Tiger, which compares indicators of real activity, financial markets and
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) confidence with their [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) averages. The IMF projections
for global growth should also be gloomy. The IMF forecast for the global
GDP is one of the highlights of the week through April 17. Kristalina
Georgieva, IMF managing director, said that 170 of its 189 member
countries would suffer falling output per head in 2020. “This crisis
knows no boundaries. Everybody hurts,” she said.

How will the US dollar and the S&P 500 react to IMF gloomy forecasts? I
do not think the US stocks will be rising as quickly as they were in the
week through April 10. Such bullish drivers as the increase in Fed
lending programs to $ 2.3 trillion and the hopes for an oil production
cut have already been played. Furthermore, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s doubt that the new
OPEC+ agreement will be enough to stabilize the oil market. On the other
hand, an improvement in the epidemiological situation can support the
buyers of the stocks and the [EUR/USD][4]. The euro bulls are yet
willing to break out the resistance at $1.0965, but they need a fresh
driver to continue the rally.
