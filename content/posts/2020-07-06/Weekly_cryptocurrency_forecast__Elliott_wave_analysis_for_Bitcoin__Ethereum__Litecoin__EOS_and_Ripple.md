for Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, EOS and Ripple][2]**

The BTCUSD market is forming the corrective wave 4 of a global degree.
It is composed of the sub-waves [W]-[X]-[Y] unfolding as a double
zigzag. There is now developing the upward linking wave [X] as a double
zigzag (W)-(X)-(Y). There have completed the (W) zigzag consisting of
the sub-waves A-B-C, and the linking down wave [X] that is composed of
the sub-waves W-X-Y. There is now developing the bullish wave (Y) as a
normal zigzag A-B-C. Let us study this zigzag in more detail on the
eight-hour timeframe.

Within the upward zigzag, there is finishing the impulse wave A that is
composed of the sub-waves [1]-[2]-[3]-[4]-[5]. Presumably, the
corrective wave [4] should finish soon as a double three (w)-(x)-(y).
After a short decline, the price could turn up and start rising in the
final impulse [5]. The price should go up to a level of 10405, which is
the previous high made by wave (x).

Within the upward zigzag A-B-C, the bullish impulse wave A has
completed, it consists of five sub-waves. There is now forming the
corrective wave B that is composed of the sub-waves [W]-[X]-[Y], it is
developing as a double three. The market is likely to continue moving
down in the [Y] towards the previous low made by the (a) impulse, it is
level 214.82. Next, when the sideways correction B completes, the price
should start rising in the new uptrend.

The LTCUSD market continues following the triple zigzag that is composed
of the sub-waves [W]-[X]-[Y]-[X]-[Z]. There is now developing the final
wave of this triple combination, it is wave [Z] that is unfolding as a
simple bear zigzag (A)-(B)-(C). Impulse (A) has completed, and there is
now developing the corrective wave (B) that may complete as a simple
zigzag. Let study the most recent section of the chart in more detail.

The upward wave A has completed as an impulse. The market has started
forming a sideways movement, the B correction that is a double three
[W]-[X]-[Y]. There is now forming the [Y] wave as a bearish double
zigzag (w)-(x)-(y). Within this zigzag, the sub-waves (w) and (x) have
completed, and the (y) zigzag, which is composed of the sub-waves a-b-c
is till developing. The b correction should finish soon. Next, the price
could start declining in the c-impulse towards the previous low made by
impulse a, level 39.08.

###  **Elliott wave analysis for[EOSUSD][10]**

 **![LiteForex: Weekly cryptocurrency forecast. Elliott wave analysis

In the global down triple zigzag currently unfolding, there is
developing the upward linking wave [X] as a simple zigzag (A)-(B)-(C).

corrective wave (B). Let study the structure of this wave in more detail
in the H8 hour timeframe.

The corrective wave (B) is a sideways three W-X-Y. There have complete
the first two elements of this formation, the sub-waves W and X, there
is now forming the final wave Y. Wave Y is likely to be a bearish double
zigzag [w]-[x]-[y], where the [y] wave, which is composed of the sub-
waves (a)-(b)-(c), is forming. Presumably, the (b) correction should
complete after a short rise. Next, the price should start declining in
the (c) impulse as it is outlined in the chart.
