Buy dollar? Obviously! Forecast as of 05.10.2021Dmitri Demidenko

Greenback is growing thanks to its safe-haven status and expectations of
the Fed's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) normalization, which translates into a rally
in Treasury yields. How long will the [EURUSD][1] be falling?  Let us
discuss the Forex outlook and make up a trading plan.

## Monthly US dollar fundamental forecast

That is the nature of safe-haven assets: they are highly demanded in
times of global economic crisis. However, once there is some positive
[news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/), safe havens are being sold off. TD Securities believes that a lot
of negative has been already priced in the USD rate, and it would not
buy the greenback at current levels. I beg to differ.

Having added more than 2% in September, the USD index reached its
highest level in a year. Does its price include the factor of a
potential US default? I do not think so. If Congress has solved a
similar problem at the last moment nine dozen times before, why
shouldn't it do the same in October 2021? Yes, Republicans are
resisting, having already blocked the Democratic proposal twice, but in
the end, reason must win. Solving the debt ceiling problem will only
temporarily strengthen the [S&P 500][2] and weaken the US dollar. The
trend cannot be broken.

Is Washington's statement that it does not want an escalation of the
conflict with Beijing and is ready to negotiate good [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) for the global
economy and a reason to sell the greenback? I doubt. Import tariffs
remained in force, and what kind of dialogue they are talking about is
not specified. They could mean the phase-two negotiations on structural
reforms in China, for which it is not ready. In addition, the USA
intends to demand that China must fulfill its obligations to increase
purchases of US products by $200 billion compared to 2017, which,
according to the Peterson Institute for International Economics, were
implemented only by 62% in the three months before the end of 2021.

Will the victory over the pandemic in Europe and the USA result in the
rapid growth of the global economy, pressing down safe-haven assets? I
don't think so, as the oil prices rally to seven-year highs and the
greenback strengthening are the factors hindering the global GDP
expansion. It means further inflation rise and tightening of the global
financial conditions, which will eventually lead to stagflation.

Will the US stock market stop correcting, depriving the US dollar of the
benefit of a safe-haven asset? I expect more volatility and long-term
consolidation. About 40% of the revenue of the [S&P 500][2] companies
comes from abroad, so a rise in the USD index will worsen corporate
reporting and press down the stock index, further strengthening the
greenback.

Treasury yields have recently been growing faster than the European bond
yields. Which is better, to buy 10-year US Treasury bonds at a rate of
1.5% or German bonds with a similar maturity at a rate of -0.3%? The
answer is obvious.

### Monthly[ EURUSD][1] trading plan

I am not sure that bad [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) has ended. I am not sure if the Treasuries
yield will stop rising. Therefore, the [EURUSD][1] downtrend will
continue. It is relevant to sell on the price rise with the targets at
1.145 and 1.133.
