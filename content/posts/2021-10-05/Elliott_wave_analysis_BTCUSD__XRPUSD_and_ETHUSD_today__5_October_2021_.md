Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 05.10.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

Ethereum and Bitcoin are rising in the final legs of bullish impulses.
Ripple is rising in the final part of the bullish zigzag X.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

 ****

The hourly BTCUSD chart shows an uptrend. There is developing the
bullish zigzag (А)-(В)-(С), where impulse (A) and correction (B), a
short bearish zigzag, look complete. There is unfolding the impulse wave
(C) composed of sub-waves 1-2-3-4-5. Impulse 3 is about to finish soon,
the price should be rising in wave [5] of 3. After the Bitcoin price
reaches level 50379.4, it should start declining in correction 4.
Therefore, one could enter short-term purchases at the current levels
with the target of 50379.4.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 49298.50, TP 50379.41

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

 ****The XRPUSD market is forming the upward linking wave X that has
started after the descending zigzag W completed. Wave X, like the zigzag
W, is composed of three sub-waves A]-[B]-[C]. Wave [A] finished; wave
[B] completed as a flat; impulse [C] is still developing, it is composed
of sub-waves (1)-(2)-(3)-(4)-(5). There must have started bullish
impulse (5) of [C] of X, which should drive the price up to a level of
1.175. Thus, one could enter long trades with a target at 1.175. At this
level, the X wave will reach 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of the previous
wave W.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] **** today:

Buy 1.043, TP 1.175

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

 ****

The Ethereum market situation is similar to that of Bitcoin. There are
unfolding final parts of the large bullish zigzag. The [B] wave is a
simple bearish zigzag, composed of sub-waves (А)-(В)-(С), where the (C)
impulse is composed of sub-waves 1-2-3-4-5. There is now developing the
upward wave [C] made up of sub-waves (1)-(2)-(3)-(4)-(5) of a smaller
degree. Today, the Ethereum price could rise in the bullish impulse  5
of (3) towards a level of 3675.7. Therefore, it is relevant to enter
purchases with a target at 3675.7.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Buy 3379.85, TP 3675.74
