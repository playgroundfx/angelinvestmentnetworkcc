Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 15.02.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

The XRPUSD market should soon finish the triple zigzag. Bitcoin and
Ethereum continue forming large bullish impulses.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

The corrective wave 4 completed as a triple zigzag [w]-[x]-[y]-[x]-[z].
Next, the market has started rising in impulse wave 5. Most likely, the
sub-waves [1]-[2]-[3] have completed in impulse 5. The market is now
forming the initial element of the bearish correction [4]. Correction
[4] should end as a simple zigzag (A)-(B)-(C), as it is outlined in the
chart. The zigzag should end at a level of around 43110.00, where wave
[4] will reach 38.2% Fibonacci retracement of the bullish impulse [3].

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Sell 46805.50 TP 43110.00

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

The XRPUSD market has completed the bullish linking wave (X). Next,
there has started forming the bearish zigzag composed of the sub-waves
[A]-[B]-[C]. Impulse [A] has ended, and there is forming the final leg
of the [B] correction. Correction [B] is a triple zigzag, and the price
is now declining in the linking wave (xx). The market could be running
down to a level of 0.481. Next, after the indicated level is reached,
the Ripple price should resume rising in the medium-term.

### Trading plan for **[XRPUSD][2]** today:

Sell 0.537, TP 0.481

## Elliott wave Ethereum analysis

The ETHUSD market is forming the final leg of the large bullish trend.
After the skewed triangle 4 completed, the price has started rising in
the bullish impulse wave 5, whose final leg is composed of the sub-waves
[iv] and [v]. Correction [iv] could end at a level around 1570.67. Next,
the market can start rising in impulse [v]. At level 1570.67, the entire
corrective wave [iv] will reach the Fibonacci ratio of 50% of the
previous bullish impulse [iii], so the likelihood of a decline at this
level is quite high.

### Trading plan for  **[ETHUSD][3] **today:

Sell 1707.39, TP 1570.67
