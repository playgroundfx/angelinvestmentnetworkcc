Yen uses old ties. Forecast as of 15.02.2021Dmitri Demidenko

In the second half of 2020, the greenback reacted actively to the change
in global risk appetite. In 2021, the Japanese yen does this. What are
the consequences for the JPY? Let's discuss the market outlook and make
up a trading plan for [USDJPY][1], [EURJPY][2] and [AUDJPY][3].

## Fundamental Japanese Yen forecast for six months

While humanity only dreams of picking up the threads of an old life,
financial markets are actively doing this. The old ties, which had been
relevant for ten years, were broken from 2018 to 2020 due to trade wars
and the pandemic. In 2021 [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s start to turn to them again. Those
who do it first will get the opportunity to make the most significant
profit.

If for the stock market, the [S&P 500][4] and the VIX volatility index
are the best indicators of [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) risk appetite, then for Forex
traders, it has traditionally been the [AUDJPY][3] pair. The Australian
dollar was considered to be a profitable currency due to the higher
rates of the Australian debt market compared to other issuers of G10
currencies. The yen was ranked among the main funding currencies and
safe-haven assets. Donald Trump's protectionist policies and the
pandemic have turned everything upside down. The RBA significantly eased
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), Australian bond yields went down, and some [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s
began to use the AUD as a funding currency against the EM currencies in
carry trades.

The return of financial markets to a normal state made [AUDJPY][3] the
main indicator of traders' risk appetite again. This is proved by the
pair's growing correlation with US stock indices.

While the Australian dollar is supported by confidence in the global
economic recovery and the booming commodity market, the yen is under
pressure from the vaccination process and relentlessly rising US debt
market rates. Last year, I wrote that because of the Fed's large-scale
monetary stimulus, the dollar took away the status of the main safe-
haven asset from the yen. However, the rally in Treasury yields suggests
that there has been a return to old values. In my opinion, this makes
the yen the main Forex outsider in 2021. The steady growth of the
[Nikkei 225][5] also puts pressure on the Japanese currency.

Looking at how the [S&P 500][4] hits all-time highs, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s want to
buy US stocks though knowing the risks. The fact that the stock index
has risen to an unprecedented height increases the risk of a pullback.
Another thing is the [Nikkei 225][5]. It reached 30,000 for the first
time since 1990, but it is still far from the record high of 38915.
Buying Japanese stocks by foreign [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s while hedging currency risks
by selling the yen is a bullish driver for [USDJPY][1] and other related
pairs. This connection worked for years and was broken in 2018-2020. But
in 2021, it returns to the game again.

### Dynamics of [USDJPY][1] and Nikkei 225

I have often been talking about the yen as the Forex outsider in 2021
and [recommend entering][6] [USDJPY][1] and [EURJPY][2] long trades with
targets at 107-108 and 129-130. The Australian dollar, by contrast, has
been my [favorite][7] since March. When one currency is steadily going
up, and the other is going down, it would be nice to squeeze the maximum
out of Forex by buying [AUDJPY][3] with targets at 83 and 84. It would
be nice if the [S&P 500][4] pullback would allow traders to buy the pair
cheaper.
