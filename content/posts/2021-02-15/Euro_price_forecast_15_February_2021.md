Euro: Titanic is not going down. Forecast as of 15.02.2021Dmitri
Demidenko

The [EURUSD][1] bulls could have been desperate because of the severe
economic crisis in the euro area and Italy's political turmoil. However,
Mario Draghi and a potential inflation rise suggest a more optimistic
outlook. Let us discuss the Forex outlook and make up a trading plan.

## Weekly euro fundamental forecast

In recent years, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s have expected the central banks to act
according to the principle ‘self comes first’. They ease monetary
policies under the pretext of fueling inflation, rejecting to admit that
they take part in the currency wars. Although, the world’s leading
central banks actually manipulate currencies. As a result, Forex rates
have stopped floating. They are drowning. However, when the central
banks’ presidents, whether current or former, begin to act like a single
fist, it is extremely difficult to resist them. Mario Draghi's
appointment as Prime Minister of Italy, Janet Yellen's statement about
the commitment of the Biden Administration to multilateralism, and the
hawkish tone of the Bundesbank president, Jens Weidmann, allowed the
[EURUSD][1] bulls to win their positions back quickly.

Italy is notorious for the turmoil, both political and economic. Even
before the global crisis, Italy, torn apart by political disputes, was
in a deep depression, and COVID-19 only exacerbated existing problems.
One of the deepest recessions in the EU contributed to the growth of
Euroscepticism, which put pressure on the [EURUSD][1]. And now Draghi
comes to power; he is famous for saving the euro and clearly sees the
European Union's future. Mario Draghi is supported by the ECB, which
appears to be targeting the yield spread between Italian and German
bonds, and by the European Recovery Fund, which should provide more than
€ 200 billion to Rome.

The former Fed Chair, Janet Yellen, has returned to big politics, which
is also a significant event for the global economy. At her first meeting
of G7 ministers, she announced the US emphasis on multilateralism. This
increases the chances of solving complex issues such as climate, digital
taxes, and aid to developing countries and contributes to globalization
and international trade growth. Due to Donald Trump and his trade wars,
global trade plunged, which negatively affected export-led economies'
currencies. In particular, the euro suffered the most.

Furthermore, Jens Weidmann has discouraged the [EURUSD][1] bears. The
Bundesbank president said that German inflation in 2021 could grow above
3% and warned that monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) should be tightened if the price
forecast requires it. The ECB hawks, pressed by Mario Draghi, are
encouraged by Christine Lagarde, which is also good [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) for the euro.
And even though [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s believe that Germany's CPI surge from -0.7% to
+ 1.6% in January is a temporary phenomenon, the real data can be
different. The seasonal recession of COVID-19, vaccinations, and the
opening of economies after the lockdown, according to Nordea Market,
will allow the euro-area economy, which is compared with the Titanic, to
rise by 12.5% on an annual basis. The inflation rate will grow along
with the GDP.

### Weekly [EURUSD][1] trading plan

Therefore, easing political risks in Italy, the abandonment of the US
protectionism, and the ECB hawks support the [EURUSD][1] bulls. The
correction to the level of 1.208, [as expected][2], allowed to open
longs with the targets at 1.221 and 1.225. I recommend holding the long
trades up.
