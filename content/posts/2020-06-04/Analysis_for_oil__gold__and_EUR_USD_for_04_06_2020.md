Analysis for oil, gold, and EUR/USD for 04.06.2020Alex Rodiоnov

###  **USCrude –** **oil** ****

Oil price has consolidated above Target Zone 4 [34.17 – 33.42]. The next
upside target for the next week or two is Target Zone 5 [41.67 – 40.92].

The key support of the medium-term uptrend is now in the zone of [28.38
- 27.48]. To enter new purchases, I recommend expecting the price
correction down to the support zone and looking for a buy pattern.

It is clear from the oil H1 chart that the price reached Gold Zone 4
[37.54 – 37.17] in the short-term uptrend. After that, the price was
corrected down and tested Additional Zone [35.13 – 34.91]. The price is
now rolling up from this support.

For today, I suggest looking for a buy pattern in AZ. If AZ is broken
out downside, it will be relevant to sell with a target in Intermediary
Zone [32.88 - 32.43]. IZ is the trend key support, so, if it is
retested, we shall look for buy entries.

 **[USCrude][3]Trading ideas for today:  **

  1. Buy according to the pattern in Additional Zone [35.13 - 34.91]. TakeProfit: 37.35. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. Buy according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone [32.88 - 32.43]. TakeProfit: 37.35. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

###  **XAUUSD – gold**

In the middle-term chart, gold is trading in the correction down in the
middle-term uptrend. The correction target is to test Target Zone
[1673.6 – 1664.4].

According to the previous trading recommendations, we should have
entered sell trades. I recommend moving trades to the breakeven. One
could also exit a part of sell trades, hold the rest trades down to the
target.

Let us look at the shorter timeframe. The short-term gold trend is down.
The trend momentum broke through the local low yesterday, so we should
rearrange the resistance zones.

For today, we should track the price action relative to Additional Zone
[1714.4 – 1712.1]. If the price is corrected up into the zone, we shall
enter new sell trades according to the pattern. The major sell target is
Target Zone [1673.6 — 1664.4].

 **[XAUUSD][6] Trading ideas for today:  **

Hold down a part of sell trades entered at level 1736.6. TakeProfit:
Target Zone [1673.6 - 1664.4]. StopLoss: at breakeven.

###  **EURUSD – euro/dollar**

The EURUSD is close to Target Zone 3 [1.1291 - 1.1273], but the zone has
been tested. TZ3 is still the major upside target for this week.

The price may be corrected down and test the trend key support. We
should enter buy entries at good prices.

![LiteForex: Analysis for oil, gold, and EUR/USD for 04.06.2020][7]

The price reached Target Zone 2 [1.1252 – 1.1234] in the short-term
trend. You should now exit all buy trades and prepare for a correction.

It is clear from the chart that sellers are testing the strong support

Additional Zone [1.1212 – 1.1207]. If it is broken out, the next
downside target will be Intermediary Zone [1.1166 – 1.1157].

However, the short-term trend is still up, so you should use any buy
pattern.

 **[EURUSD][9] Trading ideas for today: **

  1. If Additional Zone [1.1212 - 1.1207] is broken out, sell on the retest. TakeProfit: Intermediary Zone [1.1166 - 1.1157]. StopLoss: 1.1230.

  2. Buy according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone [1.1166 - 1.1157]. TakeProfit: 1.1255. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

> IZ - Intermediary Zone: responsible for the price momentum reversing

>

> TZ - Target Zone: a zone that is 75% likely to be reached after IZ
breakout.

>

> GZ - Gold Zone: zone in the medium-term momentum.

>

> All zones are calculated based on the average [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) price of the
instrument and margin requirements of the futures.
