Tesla: Bitcoin in the stock market. Part 2.Mikhail Hypov

##  **Analysis of Tesla. Dependence of the stock rate on Musk’s tweets.
Global scenario of future fluctuations. Medium- and short-term forecasts
for TSLA stock**

Here’s the second part of my analysis of Tesla shares. In my previous
article I’ve proved that Musk has been actively manipulating [the rate
of shares][1] in order to help his entourage earn money and increase his
own capital, apparently. Musk started that kind of manipulations long
before the latest events. His first obvious step against the crowd was
in August 2018 when he tweeted the following: “Am considering taking
Tesla private at $420.  Funding secured”. The [share cost ][1] was near
$340 at that moment.

scenarios][3]

But if we examine the chart above, we’ll see that buying had started on
2nd August, a few days before that tweet. The [stock][1] started trading
with a giant upward gap then.  After that statement, the price sharply
soared and then selling began. In other words, Musk has been using the
same tactics: he gives insiders a signal to open positions; he makes a
public statement and then fixes profits amid the crowd’s hype. Back
then, a big scandal occurred and Musk was sued by [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s who lost
millions of dollars because of that tweet. The SEC investigated the case
too. Finally, a legal case was brought against Musk, but it was handled
prior to trial **.** Musk got away easy with a penalty of $20 million
and a lost chair of Tesla. He remained Tesla’s CEO though and continued
managing the company.

The current situation isn’t as unclouded now. His latest tweet about
Tesla’s too high price made him more enemies. Even Musk’s most devoted
fans started questioning his adequacy after he demanded that the US
quarantine should be lifted (you can check the tweet. “FREE AMERICA NOW”
[here][4]). He also urged the company’s staff to get back to work
despite the state’s decision to keep the self-isolation mode.  Against
that background, ordinary US citizens started protesting.  Many
potential buyers who had already made their bookings started cancelling
them and asking their money back to express their disapproval of Musk’s
actions. The list of those tweets can be checked [here][5].

manipulations and correlation with Elon Musk’s tweets, actual
scenarios][6]

Faced with a probable wave of new suits, Elon Musk plans to sell his
property, according to [CNBC][7]. In his radio interview to Joe Rogan
Musk said that “possessions would only burden him”. However, the true
reason may be a fear of tougher future decisions in court. So, Musk is
willing to sell out his property and to save money in his proxies’
accounts. Otherwise I don’t understand why Musk decided to organise the
sale right after tweeting about Tesla’s high [share price][1] and during
a growing economic crisis. It will be hard to sell property at a high
price now that demand is slumping. The successful launch of Crew Dragon
saved his reputation for sure. No doubt, it’s a historic event and Musk
became a national hero.

![LiteForex: History of Tesla stock fluctuations, analysis of eventual
manipulations and correlation with Elon Musk’s tweets, actual
scenarios][8]

[Tesla][1]’s current price growth may be connected to Musk’s buyback.
One of the hypotheses is that Musk himself started buying his stock back
through proxies amid panicky sales. So, that tweet was necessary to
allow the right people to buy stock unnoticed.  In a common situation,
big purchases would have provoked a big growth. Now it looks like the
price flattened under the influence of the high market demand among
private [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s. This idea seems plausible to me as I can hardly
imagine a wise [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) who would buy [stock][1] near its [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/)
maximums after the founder himself said the price was too high. Still, I
assume that Musk didn’t organise it for enrichment purposes. He probably
wanted to save the price from collapsing in an emotionally unstable
market. Raising the price to its highs one more time and covering the
fall caused by the scandalous statement, Musk automatically removes
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s’ most claims. Now if a fall does happen, it will look natural
and Musk will be blamed less.

 **Conclusion**

The [Tesla][1] company’s fundamental indicators have nothing to do with
its [stock][1] pricing. In this regard, [Tesla][1] is Bitcoin of the
stock market because its price forms based on public hype, fans’ trust
and the immediate manipulator’s support. Making an appropriate forecast
for the [stock][1] price is hard in these circumstances, but I’ll do my
best.

 **Technical analysis**

![LiteForex: History of Tesla stock fluctuations, analysis of eventual
manipulations and correlation with Elon Musk’s tweets, actual
scenarios][9]

I spoke of a 5-wave global cycle and the third wave forming in my [
January forecast ][10] for [Tesla.][1] Then it was obvious that the
price would hang somewhere in between 1.618 and 2.618 Fib of the first
wave.

![LiteForex: History of Tesla stock fluctuations, analysis of eventual
manipulations and correlation with Elon Musk’s tweets, actual
scenarios][11]

The third wave started developing in the most optimistic scenario,
having reached almost 2.618 (the level of 989 USD) and set a new
[historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) high at 968.99 USD. Obviously, 1,000 USD is a strong
psychological barrier. Bulls will hardly break it in the nearest future.
The actual market state says that the third wave is long. It lets us
suppose a strong retracement up to 0.618 of the impulsive wave. On the
whole, this state correlates with general market sentiments and a
probable strong crisis wave, so a long correction is expected. If this
scenario comes true, the fifth wave might not even reach the peak of the
third wave. It’s a regular situation.

manipulations and correlation with Elon Musk’s tweets, actual
scenarios][12]

If we look at the situation in detail, the fourth wave may develop
according to 2 scenarios. It’s either an equilateral triangle with
5-wave structure ABCDE inside:

![LiteForex: History of Tesla stock fluctuations, analysis of eventual
manipulations and correlation with Elon Musk’s tweets, actual
scenarios][13]

…or a flat correction (check the chart above). Such a scenario is less
probable, but can’t be fully excluded.

I can say one thing for sure.

![LiteForex: History of Tesla stock fluctuations, analysis of eventual
manipulations and correlation with Elon Musk’s tweets, actual
scenarios][14]

On the H4 time frame, wave B is nearing its completion. The 5-wave
structure is clearly seen (marked green) and the third wave is long too
there. It indicates a potentially weak and extended wave B. We also see
a general reduction in trading volumes (marked red), which points to the
end of the wave too.

![LiteForex: History of Tesla stock fluctuations, analysis of eventual
manipulations and correlation with Elon Musk’s tweets, actual
scenarios][15]

An attempt to close the gap may be made in the next few days. If so, we
will see the price at 835 USD. Then there may be a pullback, but the
chance of breaking the level of 900 USD is minimal. Afterwards, bears
may hope for opening short positions.

 **Trading plan**

Bears in [Tesla][1] stock have the most advantageous position now.
Targets and risks are clear. Stop orders may be safely placed beyond the
[historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) high at 968USD. Sellers’ nearest target is 835 USD. In a
longer term, we may test the minimum of the fourth wave. But I would
count on the area of 500 USD, considering strong bullish sentiments
regarding Tesla.
