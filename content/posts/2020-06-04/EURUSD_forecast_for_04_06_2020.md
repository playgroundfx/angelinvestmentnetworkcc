Dollar is carried away by injectionsDmitri Demidenko

## The Fed may have overdone it with cheap liquidity. Could it crash the
greenback?

They wanted the best, and you know the rest. The Fed surprised [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s
with the huge monetary stimulus as a response to the pandemic, which has
resulted in the fact that the markets are disconnected from reality.
Markets ignore US poor domestic data and weak corporate reporting, and
the stocks continue rallying up amid huge injections of liquidity, which
could be associated with morphine injections for the patient. The
Federal Reserve has managed to calm the markets down, but [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s
wonder now whether the central bank has overdone with it. Will the cheap
money turn the recent USD decline into a crash?

In spring, the Fed’s balance sheet was 70% up to more than $7 trillion,
the ECB balance sheet increased by 18%, the BoJ’s – by 8%. Naturally,
the greenback has lost its shine under those conditions. The dollar’s
weakness is further evidence that the global economy is recovering.
During the recovery periods, the safe-haven demand is falling, it makes
no sense to hold big shares of safe havens in the portfolios.

 **Dynamics of the Fed’s balance sheet**

The US stock indexes are rising as [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s believe in a soon economic
rebound. The US PMI has been up from April’s low, the ADP report on the
US private-sector employment is stronger than it was expected. Moreover,
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s expect that the US new weekly jobless claims should fall below
2 million for the first time since March. The global risk appetite is
increasing, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are willing to sell off safe havens, which is an
important growth driver for the [EUR/USD][2]. The euro is also supported
by the optimism about euro-area unity.

One of the most important factors pressing the euro-dollar down in
spring was quick measures taken by the Fed and the White House to
support the US economy. The huge fiscal and monetary stimuli reassured
the markets, suggesting the idea that the worst can be avoided. The EU,
on the contrary, was very slow to act, which resulted in gloomy
projections for the euro-area economy amid a difficult epidemiological
situation.

Everything has changed at the turn of May and June. The Fed didn’t take
additional measures, estimating the effect of the monetary expansion.
The White House and Congress are failing to find a compromise on the
expansion of the stimulus package. The EU, on the contrary, is now
acting quickly and decisively. According to UniCredit Bank, taking into
account the issuance of bonds worth €750 billion by the European
Commission and the expansion of Germany’s aid package by €130 billion,
the total size of the euro-area fiscal stimulus is about €1.5 trillion,
which is 13% of the GDP. Furthermore, the ECB meeting on June 4 may
boost the QE by another €500 billion, so that the total size of the
program will be €1.6 trillion.

In my opinion, the ECB governors should take active measures now, even
if they don’t need to use the entire package. It is better to meet
market expectations now. If [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s do not get what they want, they
could start exiting the [EUR/USD][2] longs. I think we should also exit
a part of the euro longs now. The target at $1.124 has been reached.
