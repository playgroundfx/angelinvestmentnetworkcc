Pound keeps the distanceDmitri Demidenko

## The GBP depends on the whims of a single person

What is more dangerous, the pandemic or Brexit? The [GBP/USD][1] rally
to its monthly high gives a clue. As the epidemiological situation
improves and the world’s major economies reopen, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are willing
to sell safe havens, including the US dollar. The risks of breaking
foreign economic relations, a further slowdown in Britain’s GDP, and
even the introduction of the negative interest rates by the Bank of
England are losing their importance. There are even talks in markets
that, if the transition period is not extended in June, the uncertainty
will still decline, as there will be only two [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) out of three. All
of this supports the pound.

Of course, the share of the US dollar in the total volume of Forex
operations is much greater than that of the sterling. Besides, the
impact of COVID-19 on the UK economy is much stronger than that of
Brexit. A no-deal Brexit, according to the UK government’s estimates
made in 2018, will result in the GDP contraction by about 8% in the next
15 years. The Office for Budget Responsibility warns that the pandemic
could cause a 13.8% GDP drop in 2021. According to Deutsche Bank, in
case of a no-deal Brexit, the economy will lose 1.5% in 2021 alone, and
it will drop by 8% by 2030. In this case, the Bank of England will have
to lower the interest rates below zero.

Therefore, the coronavirus is obviously more dangerous than Brexit. If
so, the [GBP/USD][1] rally looks natural. However, the pound is
strengthening not only versus the US dollar but also against the euro
that is also strong amid the EU huge fiscal stimulus. The pound monthly
risk reversals reached the highest level since mid-March.

I think the matter is in psychology. The UK's unwillingness to make
concessions to the EU to reach a compromise and at least extend the
deadline allowed [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s to price a no-deal Brexit in the [GBP/USD][1]
and [EUR/GBP][3] quotes. Once there appeared the hope for the Brexit
deal, the sales on rumors were replaced by the purchases on facts.

However, the sterling’s rally confuses neither hedge funds nor analysts.
Hedge funds continue increasing their pound net shorts in the
derivatives market over the six consecutive weeks, including the week
ending on May 26. Reuters experts see the [GBP/USD][1] fall down to 1.23
by late June. However, the pair is expected to rise to 1.26 in late
2020, as they expect the UK-EU deal to be signed.

In my opinion. Boris Johnson’s unwillingness to extend the deadline will
keep the uncertainty strong, which weighs on the UK securities. The FTSE
100 is trading about 17% lower than it was in January, while EuroStoxx
600 is about 13% down, and the S&P 500 has lost about 5%.

I believe the transition period will hardly be extended, which suggests
that the sterling’s rally went too high, and it makes sense to sell the
[GBP/USD][1] if the support at 1.245 is successfully tested. After all,
who knows what Boris Johnson will do? I recommend those who do not want
to risk their money because of the whims of a single man to be careful
and monitor the GBP market staying at a distance.
