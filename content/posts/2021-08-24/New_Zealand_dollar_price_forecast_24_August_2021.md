Kiwi needs to correct mistakes. Forecast as of 24.08.2021Dmitri
Demidenko

Central bank decisions sometimes look illogical, but rarely funny. The
apology from the RBNZ officials suggests that the country's regulator
has got into mess. What will happen next with [NZDUSD][1]? Let us
discuss the Forex outlook and make up a trading plan.

## Monthly New Zealand dollar fundamental forecast

Each time has its own heroes or antiheroes. Traders will remember for a
long time how the pound fell after the UK left the EU, as well as how
the franc and the yen soared due to the cancellation of the lower limit
of 1.2 by the National Bank for [EURCHF][2] and the flash crash,
respectively. 2021 will be remembered for the RBNZ's panic, which was on
the verge of raising the cash rate, but eventually retreated. The
nationwide isolation of New Zealand and the retention of the main
interest rate at the previous level of 0.25% was a real shock for the
Kiwi. However, the NZD soon came to its senses.

An increase of inflation to 3.3%, which is above the upper limit of the
RBNZ's targeted range of 1-3%, and a drop in the unemployment rate to
4%. What other reasons are required for tightening monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)?
Adrian Orr and his colleagues were determined to be the first among the
G10 to start monetary restriction. At least most Bloomberg experts had
expected the cash rate to rise by 25 bps or even by 50 bps in August.
Money markets were confident that the rate would rise to 2% by early
2024, making New Zealand bonds highly attractive to foreign [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s
and strengthening the Kiwi due to capital inflows.

### Dynamics New Zealand inflation and the Reserve Bank interest rate

Alas, a pandemic intervened in RBNZ's ambitious plans. It took only one
COVID-19 case for the government to declare nationwide isolation, while
the central bank remained in place. The lockdown was subsequently
extended, but Adrian Orr told parliament that the pandemic would not
stop monetary restrictions. This will require a significant decrease in
demand. I don’t know about you, but to me it sounds like an excuse.

After other officials of the Reserve Bank became more hawkish, the money
markets increased the probability of a cash rate increase in October,
which supported the New Zealand dollar. An additional driver of its
growth was the information that China, with the help of draconian
measures, managed to cope with COVID-19 in just 4 days. If the patient
zero strategy works in populous China, why not work in New Zealand. At
the same time, Wellington has the opportunity to increase the number of
fully vaccinated people. Currently, the figure is ridiculous - 19.4%.

In my opinion, the Reserve Bank has understood its mistake and is eager
to correct it, so the cash rate increase will occur in October.
Expectations of tightening monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) are a sure sign of future
strengthening of the national currency. So [AUDNZD][3] sales towards
1.0385 and 1.327 are still relevant. The nationwide isolation in New
Zealand and the subsequent retention of the RBNZ rate at 0.25%
contributed to the [EURNZD][4] rise. However, the bears very quickly
regained the initiative. The fall of the pair below 0.685 and 0.675 will
allow entering short trades in the direction of 1.651-1.653. For
[NZDUSD][1], I expect medium-term consolidation in the 0.68-0.71 range.
