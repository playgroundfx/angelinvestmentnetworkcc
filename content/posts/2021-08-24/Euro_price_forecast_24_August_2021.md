What does euro need? Forecast as of 24.08.2021Dmitri Demidenko

If the US economy loses its exclusivity, and the economies of China and
the euro area perform well, will the [EURUSD][1] downtrend turn up? Let
us discuss the Forex outlook and make up a trading plan.

## Weekly euro fundamental forecast

China is fighting with the COVID-19, but the pandemic is rapidly
spreading across Europe and the United States, whose economies are
slowing down. What period are we to face? Is it similar to early spring
of 2020? Or is it about late summer 2021? Of course, there won’t be any
lockdowns, neither there should be a recession. Nonetheless, the drop in
the US manufacturing PMI means that people worry about the Delta. What
happened next, in April-December with [EURUSD][1], we all know very
well. Does [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) repeat itself? Will the downtrend reverse soon?

The euro area PMIs are also declining, but they are still close to their
21-year high. The optimism about the services sector exceeds the
forecasts for the manufacturing one. It means the coronavirus influences
GDP growth less than the supply shortage. According to ING estimates,
the euro-area GDP could repeat its record of 2% Q-o-Q in the third
quarter. If the euro-area economy continues to outperform the US growth,
the [EURUSD][1] bulls will have a reason to go ahead.

I don’t understand the roots of such divergence. The level of the fully
vaccinated population in the States and the EU is approximately the
same, 51.4% and 55.3%, the number of COVID-19 cases is growing in both
regions. Furthermore, the Bundesbank warns that its forecast for the
expansion of Germany's GDP by 3.7% may not come true. The first days of
the recovery turned out to be worse than expected, and the return of the
pandemic will press down the euro-area economy in the autumn. The reason
might be the surge in the tourism industry in the south of Europe, but
it is a temporary factor.

Another thing is China. In the four days from the outbreak on August 20
to the moment when not a single new infected person was identified,
China managed to test about 100 million people. Beijing deserves
respect. Amid positive [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) from Asia, the oil prices have been up. The
oil rally is a bearish driver for the USD, which is quite responsive to
the recovery of the US and global economies.

Still, there is one more factor concerning the impact of the euro-area
and global economic growth on the [EURUSD][1], which makes me doubt that
the pair will go the same way as in the April-December period last year.
It is the Fed’s monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). In 2020, the Fed was often called crazy
because of the colossal volume of liquidity and the sharp decline in the
interest rates to zero. In 2021, the central bank is about to finish the
QE and discuss interest rate hikes. This is a viable scenario unless
Jerome Powell is scared off by the Delta.

### Weekly [EURUSD][1] trading plan

I believe the current growth of the [EURUSD][1] is just a correction
resulted from exiting the US longs. Investors worry that the Fed Chair
will relate its monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) to the COVID-19. I don’t think he will.
If the pair is up to 1.18-1.1815 before Jackson Hole, one could enter
shorts at favourable prices.
