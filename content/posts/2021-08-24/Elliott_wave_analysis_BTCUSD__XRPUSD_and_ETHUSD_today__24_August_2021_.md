Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 24.08.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

The [cryptocurrency price](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/cryptocurrency-price/)s should continue growing for some time; next,
the market will go down.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

The Bitcoin price continues rising following the upward corrective wave
[B], namely its final sub-wave (C). The (C) wave is an impulse. Let us
focus on its final leg, sub-wave 5. Sub-waves [1]-[2]-[3]-[4] have
completed, and sub-wave (5) of a smaller degree will conclude wave [5].
The Bitcoin price should rise to a level of 51900.00. Therefore, one
could open buy positions.
