Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 16.11.2020Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I suggest entry signals
to trade each cryptocurrency.

The Bitcoin market could go down a little in the corrective wave (4);
next, the price should rise in impulse (5).

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

The BTCUSD market continues developing the bullish linking wave [X] as a
double zigzag. In the two-hour timeframe, the final leg of the upward
wave (Y) is forming as a simple zigzag A-B-C; that is, the impulse wave
C is developing. Four elements out of five have completed within wave C.
There is likely to be forming the final leg of the bearish correction
(4), so the Bitcoin price should soon be rising in wave (5) towards
level 16700.00.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 15976.75, TP 16700.00

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

 ****

The XRPUSD market is forming the upward corrective wave (B) as a simple
zigzag A-B-C. Wave A is a leading diagonal, as wave [4] exceeded wave
[1]. The down corrective wave B is a triple zigzag. At the beginning of
November, the Ripple market started forming the bullish impulse wave C
that is composed of the sub-waves [1]-[2]-[3]-[4]-[5]. Shortly, the
price should be rising in the sub-wave (5) to a level of 0.280. The
corrective wave (B) reaches 61.8% Fibonacci of the (A) impulse at this
level.

### Trading plan for **[XRPUSD][2]** today:

Buy 0.270, TP 0.280

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

 ****

The ETHUSD market, like the BTCUSD, is forming the bullish impulse wave
C that is composed of five sub-waves. The first four sub-waves have
completed, and the market is rising in wave [5]. The down correction (4)
must have completed as a simple zigzag. There is now forming the initial
element of the final wave (5). Therefore, the market should be rising to
a level of 507.00.

### Trading plan for  **[ETHUSD][3] **today:

Buy 448.69, TP 507.00
