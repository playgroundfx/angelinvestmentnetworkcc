Economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the week 17.08.2020 – 23.08.2020Jana Kane

##  **Overview of the main events of the Forex economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the
next trading week (17.08.2020 – 23.08.2020)**

 **Trading on key Forex [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/): next week we expect the publication of
important macro statistics from Japan, Great Britain, Canada, the US,
Germany, the Eurozone, as well as the publication on Wednesday of the
minutes of the July Fed meeting.**

Gold prices fell, and US stock indexes ended the week in positive
territory. At the same time, S&P500 came close to the record high of
3397.0 set in February this year.

There are still strong concerns among [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s that the infection rate
and deaths from coronavirus continue to rise in the United States, which
is why some states are reintroducing quarantine restrictions in an
attempt to contain the spread of the infection.

But [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are also guided by the Fed's ultra-soft [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), which is
“ready to adjust its instruments in order to help the economy if
necessary,” and the continuing positive corporate reporting from US
companies and positive macro statistics.

The data published last Thursday by the US Department of Labor showed
that the recovery of the labor market in the country is gaining
momentum. The number of initial jobless claims filed in the week of
August 2-8 was 963,000. This is much less than the record in March, when
about 7 million claims were filed, although higher than the previous
record of 695,000 set before the pandemic began. The decrease in the
number of claims suggests that the wave of layoffs has begun to decline,
and the rate of hiring is growing, economists say.

The next week will not be full of important macro statistics.
Nevertheless, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s will pay attention to the publication of
important macro data from Japan, Great Britain, Canada, US, Germany,
Eurozone, and their focus will be the publication on Wednesday of the
minutes of the July Fed meeting.

 _ **Traders should pay attention to the following significant
macroeconomic data expected next week:**_

 *** during the coming week new events may be added to the [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) and
scheduled events may be canceled**

###  **23:50 JPY Japan's GDP for Q2 2020 (preliminary estimate)**

GDP is considered an indicator of the general state of a country's
economy and estimates the rate of its growth or decline. The report on
gross domestic product published by the Cabinet of Ministers of Japan
expresses in monetary [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) the total value of all final goods and
services produced by Japan over a certain period of time. An upward
trend in GDP is considered a positive factor for the national currency
(yen), while a low result is considered negative (or bearish).

In the previous 1st quarter of 2020, the country's GDP contracted by
-0.6% (-2.2% yoy) after falling by -1.8% (-7.1% yoy) in the 4th quarter
2019.

Japan's GDP is expected to contract by -7.6% or -27.2% on an annualized
basis in the second quarter of 2020.

The data point to a slowdown in the Japanese economy since the end of
2019, and quite a noticeable one, and this is a negative factor for the
yen and the Japanese stock market.

If the data turns out to be even weaker, the yen may decline
significantly in the short term. Better-than-forecast data may
strengthen the yen (in the short term).

However, it should also be noted that in recent weeks, financial market
participants pay little attention to [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) and weak macro statistics,
abandoning defensive assets, including the yen, in favor of riskier and
more profitable stock market assets.

###  **Monday, August 17**

No important macro statistics planned to be released.

###  **01:30 AUD Minutes of the July meeting of the RB of Australia**

This document is published two weeks after the meeting and the decision
on the interest rate. If the RBA positively assesses the state of the
labor market in the country, GDP growth rates, and also shows a hawkish
attitude towards the inflation forecast in the economy, the markets
regard this as a higher probability of a rate hike at the next meeting,
which is a positive factor for the AUD. The bank's soft rhetoric
regarding, above all, inflation puts pressure on the AUD.

At the August 4 meeting, the central bank kept its current monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) unchanged. The key interest rate of the RBA was kept at a record
low level of 0.25%, and the target yield level for 3-year government
bonds was also left at the level of 0.25%. The decision to lower the
rate and determine the current target level of government bond yields
was made at the previous unscheduled RBA meeting on March 19 in order to
support business and Australian citizens amid the rapid spread of the
coronavirus pandemic. The country's government was also forced to
introduce a social distancing regime, suspend businesses and close
borders to international traffic.

“Substantial uncertainty remains about the short-term outlook for the
Australian economy,” the RBA head Philip Lowe said after the bank
meeting, adding that “the board will not raise rates until there is
progress towards full employment and confidence that inflation will
stabilize in the target range 2-3% ". In his opinion, "there are no
serious arguments in favor of tightening monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) in the short
term," and "some time will pass before interest rates are increased."

Nevertheless, if the published minutes contain unexpected information
regarding the issues of the RBA's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), the volatility in the
AUD quotes will increase.

###  **Wednesday, August 19**

###  **06:00 GBP Consumer Price Index. Core Consumer Price Index**

 **Consumer Price Index (CPI)** reflects the dynamics of retail prices
for a group of goods and services that make up the British consumer
basket. CPI is a key indicator of inflation. Its publication causes
active movement of the pound in the foreign exchange market, as well as
the London Stock Exchange FTSE100 index.

In the previous reporting month (June), the growth of consumer inflation
(in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) amounted to 0.6%.

Forecast for July: 0.7% (annualized). This value is unlikely to provide
significant support to the pound. A value below the forecast could
provoke a weakening of the pound, as low inflation will force the Bank
of England to adhere to a soft monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).

 **Core CPI** is published by the Office for National Statistics and
determines the change in prices for a selected basket of goods and
services (excluding food and energy) for a given period. It is a key
indicator for assessing inflation and changes in purchasing preferences.
A positive result strengthens the GBP, a negative result weakens it.

In June, Core CPI (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) increased by +1.4%. The publication
of the indicator is likely to have a positive effect on the pound if its
value is higher than the forecast and the previous value. Forecast for
July: +1.3% (YoY). The indicator reading below the forecast and previous
values ​​may provoke a weakening of the pound.

###  **12:30 CAD Consumer price indices in Canada**

Core CPI from the Bank of Canada reflects the dynamics of the retail
prices of the corresponding basket of goods and services (excluding
fruits, vegetables, gasoline, fuel oil, natural gas, mortgage interest,
intercity transportation, and tobacco products). The target inflation
rate for the Bank of Canada is in the range of 1-3%. The rise in CPI is
a harbinger of a rate hike and a positive factor for the CAD. Core
Consumer Price Index rose in June by +1.1% (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)), in May -
by +0.7%, and in April - by +1.2%. If the data for July turns out to be
worse than the previous values, it will negatively affect the CAD.
Better-than-forecast data and above previous values ​​will strengthen
the Canadian dollar.

Forecast for July: CPI will come out with a value of +0.3% (in annual
[terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)).

###  **18:00 USD Minutes of the last meeting of the Federal Open Market
Committee (FOMC minutes)**

The publication of the minutes is extremely important for determining
the course of the current Fed's [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) and the prospects for interest
rate raises in the United States. The volatility of trading in financial
markets during the publication of the minutes usually increases, since
the text often contains either changes or clarifying details regarding
the results of the last FOMC Fed meeting.

Recently, more and more statements from the Fed leaders can be heard
indicating the Fed's inclination to continue its [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of supporting
the American economy, which has been badly hurt by the coronavirus.

Following a regular meeting held in late July, the Fed left interest
rates unchanged and reaffirmed its intention to support the American
economy amid the coronavirus pandemic. The US Federal Reserve Chairman
Jerome Powell said the central bank will use all of its tools for "as
long as necessary" to ensure the strongest possible economic recovery
and limit long-term economic damage. Head of the Fed noted the extremely
uncertain economic outlook for the United States, expressing concern
that the increase in the number of cases of coronavirus infection is
negatively affecting business activity in the country.

A soft tone of the minutes will have a positive effect on stock indices
and negatively on the US dollar. Tough rhetoric of the Fed leaders
regarding the prospects for monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) will push the dollar to
further growth.

part of the service sector continues to be financial services. If the

the pound is likely to drop sharply in the short term. The data better
than the forecast and the previous value will have a positive impact on
the pound. At the same time, a result above 50 is considered positive
and strengthens the GBP, one below 50 - as negative for the GBP.

May, 13.4 in April, 34.5 in March, 53.2 in February, 53.9 in January.

of consumer confidence and reflects the health of the retail sector in
the near term. A rise in the index is usually positive for the CAD; a
decrease in the indicator will negatively affect the CAD. The previous
value of the index (in May) was +24.5% after falling in March by -9.9%
and rising in April by +19.1%. If the June data turns out to be weaker
than the previous value, the CAD may decline in the short term.
