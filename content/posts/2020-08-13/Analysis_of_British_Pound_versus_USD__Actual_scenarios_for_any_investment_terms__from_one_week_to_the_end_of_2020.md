![LiteForex: Analysis of British Pound versus USD. Actual scenarios for
any investment [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/), from one week to the end of 2020][1]

Last time, I analyzed the pair in [May][2]. The chart above shows the
long-term scenario from May's publication.

![LiteForex: Analysis of British Pound versus USD. Actual scenarios for
any investment [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/), from one week to the end of 2020][3]

There's no reason to revise the above long-term scenario as it coincides
with the actual fluctuations. To make sure it's true, let's analyze the
latest economic data.

The chart of the UK 10-year bond yield breaks its historic highs. It
confirms the [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s' pessimistic sentiment and increased demand for
safe-haven investment tools. These fears aren't groundless. According to
the UK Office for National Statistics, the UK GDP dropped 20.4% in Q2.

According to Bloomberg's study, the indicator is the worst among the G7
countries and one of the worst in Europe. Chancellor of the Exchequer
Rishi Sunak has already said that the country's economy hasn't gone
through the deepest trough yet, and the situation will only worsen soon.
Also, Sunak mentioned some "tough decisions" that are yet to take. The
Bloomberg experts think he might mean higher taxes on wealth. Such a
decision can help patch up the budget hole, but as an economist, I can
say that increasing taxes during a crisis is a wrong decision that may
result in a wave of future dismissals.



Mass personnel dismissals are a pain spot in the UK economy. Almost the
whole relief package was aimed at holding back the unemployment growth.
Still, the total unemployment rate reached 7.5 million people.

The UK Office of National Statistics says it's manual, unskilled, and
underskilled jobs that have been hardest hit. The number of the
independently employed and the number of micro-businesses has decreased
too. The crisis affected such businesses as family shops, coffee houses,
bakeries, and so on. After the domestic lockdown was lifted and the
borders partly re-opened, the tourist sector started to revive. The
number of new jobs grew 10% in July compared with the record low figures
in June. Still, it's a dramatically small number of 300,000 new jobs.



On the whole, the UK economy is recovering more slowly as the Central
Bank expected. Markets are watching over the discussion of a new relief
package and awaiting an additional stimulus on the part of the BoE.
However, a new package of relief measures may be introduced only at the
beginning of 2021, and many businesses might not live until that moment.

Brexit's negative impact on the UK economy shouldn't be forgotten
either. I spoke in detail about Brexit in my [previous article][2].
Renewal of trade agreements with the EU is on the agenda. If the UK
government fails to do that before the end of the year, the UK exporters
will pay a higher rate already next January.



Thus, the country's economic risk is high, and the markets' general
sentiment is pessimistic. The good [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) is that the vaccine may appear
soon. It lowers the stress related to a probable second wave of
COVID-19.



So I can conclude that the markets expect the Bank of England to
continue its soft monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) amidst pessimistic sentiments, which
will put pressure on the [pound][7]. What is good about Forex is that we
need to consider the indicators of the base currency's country as well.
So, we need to understand the US dollar's prospects. I've already spoken
about them in this [article][8]. To sum up, the USD risks devaluing
gradually amidst the unprecedented monetary stimulation of the US
economy and the Fed's ultra-soft monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). This factor brings
about uncertainty in the fundamental estimations of currency rates. The
world is on the threshold of a race of national currencies' devaluation.
These risks have been already factored in the market and are the reason
for record-high gold prices, for example. When it comes to [GBPUSD][7],
the pair may lack direction in its fluctuations and become more
volatile. That's why the long-term scenario is uncertain from the
fundamental point of view. As for technical analysis, there's no reason
for updating the existing long-term trading plan I set in the [previous
article][2]. So, I'll stick to it.

The chart shows consolidation in the range of 1.32 - 1.143, which
confirms the idea stated above. Let's make a trading plan for the
nearest time.

### Technical analysis

![LiteForex: Analysis of British Pound versus USD. Actual scenarios for
any investment [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/), from one week to the end of 2020][10]

First, we'll check the H4 time frame. We see that [GBPUSD][7] has been
moving in a local bullish channel. However, there's an under-traded area
within this channel. The vertical volume indicator shows this area well.
The market is balanced at the moment, but consolidation has been
developing for a long time already. So, we are likely to have an impulse
next week. As the market tends to be inert in the short term, the
equilateral triangle is expected to be broken from below in the local
consolidation framework. However, there is the R1 monthly level of the
Pivot indicator and the upper edge of the global triangle above (see the
long-term scenario chart).

### Next week's trading plan

###

### ![LiteForex: Analysis of British Pound versus USD. Actual scenarios
for any investment [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/), from one week to the end of 2020][11]

[GBPUSD][7] is likely to have an upward breakout of the triangle next
week, so a trading plan is based on the long position.

Entry point: 1.3040

Stop loss: below 1.300 USD and according to your risk management system.
For example, at 1.2978.

Take Profit should be placed before the key resistance levels, at around
1.3170 USD.



Be careful: this is a high-risk trade. The Profit/Risk ratio is about 2.



### Trading plan for the nearest month

![LiteForex: Analysis of British Pound versus USD. Actual scenarios for
any investment [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/), from one week to the end of 2020][12]

Based on the long-term scenario, we expect that the global bearish trend
will continue. According to Tom DeMark's oscillators, [GBPUSD][7] got
into the overbought zone in the weekly chart. The chart came close to
the trading channel's limits. It's clearly seen using vertical volumes.
Combined with decreasing volumes, this signal confirms an upcoming
reversal point.

![LiteForex: Analysis of British Pound versus USD. Actual scenarios for
any investment [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/), from one week to the end of 2020][13]

Based on the short-term growth scenario, we should prioritize short
positions in August-September, cashing in on retracements from the key
resistance levels located on the limits of the trading channel and the
global triangle.

The entry point for a short position is at about 1.317 USD.

Stop loss must be placed above the triangle's edge at 1.330 USD.

Profits can be fixed at two targets:

The first one is at 1.288 USD, Pivot equilibrium level.

The second one is near the key support level at 1.265 USD.

The P/R ratio varies from 2 to 4, respectively.



To realize this trading plan or shorter-term trades, I recommend using
market spreads and low swaps. [LiteForex][7] is one of the brokers that
offer these conditions. If you're new to trading, use a demo account
first. You can open your first trade in one click and without
registration [here][7]. An economic crisis is a perfect time for
learning to trade. Have a go!



Good luck and profits, everyone!

Yours,

Michael @Hypov
