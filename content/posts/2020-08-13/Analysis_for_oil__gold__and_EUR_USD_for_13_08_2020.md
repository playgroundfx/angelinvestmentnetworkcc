Analysis for oil, gold and, EUR/USD for 13.08.2020Alex Rodionov

##  **Oil price forecast** **for** **today:** ** **USCrude****
******analysis**

The US session closed above Target Zone 5 [41.67 – 40.92]. We expect one
closer above the zone and record the zone breakout. The next buy target
will be Target Zone 6 [49.17 – 48.42].

The trend key support is in the zone of [37.23 — 36.61].

The short-term oil trend is up. However, buyers can’t yet break out the
intraday resistance Additional Zone [42.70 - 42.55]. Therefore, we can
expect a deep correction towards the trend key support [40.33 – 40.02].
After the test of the key support, we shall enter new purchases
according to the pattern.

For today, I recommend entering short trades in AZ. If there is no sell
pattern, and the price breaks out the zone, the price will continue
rising, and the buy target will be Gold Zone 5 [45.04 — 44.67].

##  **Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis**

Gold is trading in the middle-term downtrend. Yesterday, traders reached
the key resistance [1957.9 – 1949.2]. Today, we shall enter sell trades
in this zone with a target at the low of this week.

The gold short-term trend is up, but it will hardly last for a long
time. Yesterday, traders were testing the strong resistance [1957.9 –
1949.2]. The price is trading below the zone.

The trend key support is in the zone of [1905.8 – 1901.4].

I recommend entering sell trades in the middle-term timeframe and
ignoring the short-term trend.

###  **[XAUUSD][6] Trading ideas for today:**

Open middle-term sell positions in Target Zone [1957.9 – 1949.2]
according to the pattern. TakeProfit: 1863.4, Target Zone 3 [1829.0 -
1820.8]. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

##  **Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis**

The EUR/USD middle-term uptrend continues. The price is now rebounding
from the trend key support [1.1733 - 1.1715]. I recommend entering buy
trades according to the patterns.

![LiteForex: Analysis for oil, gold, and EUR/USD for 13.08.2020][7]

The local downtrend continues. Traders are now testing the key
resistance [1.1811 - 1.1802] trying to break it out.

The US session closed the price below the zone yesterday, making a new
local low. If the price rolls down below the resistance, breaks through
the local low, and consolidates below, there will be a false breakout
pattern. It will be a signal to sell the euro.

Otherwise, if the US session closes the price above IZ, the short-term
trend will turn up. If so, we shall look for buy entries with a target
in the upper Target Zone [1.1911 — 1.1893] starting from tomorrow.

![LiteForex: Analysis for oil, gold, and EUR/USD for 13.08.2020][8]

###  **[EURUSD][9] Trading ideas for today:**

Sell according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone [1.1811 - 1.1802].
TakeProfit: 1.1713. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

> IZ - Intermediary Zone: responsible for the price momentum reversing

>

> TZ - Target Zone: a zone that is 75% likely to be reached after IZ
breakout.

>

> GZ - Gold Zone: zone in the medium-term momentum.

>

> All zones are calculated based on the average [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) price of the
instrument and margin requirements of the futures.
