Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 18.10.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

Last week, the short-term euro trend reversed up after a breakout of
level 1.1583.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

Today the Gold Zone 82.64 - 82.38 was reached within a short-term
uptrend. Further oil growth will depend on the buyers' ability to break
out and consolidate the price above the Gold Zone. If successful, the
next target will be Target Zone 2 85.44 - 84.93.

Otherwise, a correction in ​​the Additional Zone 81.77 - 81.64 will
occur. If the Additional Zone is broken out, then sales in the
Intermediary Zone 80.49 - 80.24 will become possible.

Today it is profitable for traders to wait for a correction at strong
support levels and look for new purchases there according to the pattern
with a target at today's high.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

  1. Buy according to the pattern in Additional Zone 81.77 - 81.64. TakeProfit: 82.87. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. Buy according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 80.49 - 80.24. TakeProfit: 82.87. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

On Friday last week, the short-term trend reversed down. As a result,
the Target Zone 1763 - 1759 was reached. The further decline will depend
on the bears' ability to break out the Target Zone and consolidate the
price below. If successful, the next target for the price fall will be
the Gold Zone 1744 - 1742. Otherwise, a correction in the resistance
zone of ​​1775 - 1771 will occur.

Today, it is reasonable to consider new sales within a short-term
downtrend. Wait for a correction at strong resistance levels and look
for a sell pattern. Focus on today's low as a target.

There is no reason to enter gold purchases at the moment.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

Open sell positions according to the pattern in 1775 — 1771. TakeProfit:
1763. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

Last week, the short-term euro trend reversed up after a breakout of
level 1.1583. As part of the new trend, the Intermediary Zone 1.1621 -
1.1612 was reached. The IZ was held by the sellers. As a result, a
correction in ​​the Additional Zone 1.1581 - 1.1576 occurred.

At the moment, traders are testing the Additional Zone, trying to break
it out. Today look for purchases according to the pattern with a target
in the Intermediary Zone.

If the Additional Zone is broken out and the price closes below at the
US session, it will be possible to consider euro sales down to the level
of 1.1525.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

Buy according to the pattern in Additional Zone 1.1580 - 1.1576.
TakeProfit: 1.1621. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.
