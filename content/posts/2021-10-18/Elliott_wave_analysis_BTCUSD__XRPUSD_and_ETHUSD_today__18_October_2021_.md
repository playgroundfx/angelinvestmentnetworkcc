Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 18.10.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

Bitcoin and Ethereum are expected to rise a little higher. Let us
explore the market situation for each cryptocurrency in detail.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

 ****

It is clear from the hourly BTCUSD chart that the market is forming the
final sub-wave (C) in the upward correction [B]. Wave (C) is unfolding
as impulse 1-2-3-4-5. The first four parts of the impulse are complete,
and the final fifth sub-wave is still developing. The Bitcoin price
could go up to level 63500.00, where the entire correction [B] should
conclude. Next, there could start a new bearish trend.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 62080.00, TP 63500.00

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

The XRPUSD market is forming the linking wave X as an element of a
larger double zigzag. Wave X is likely to be a simple zigzag
[A]-[B]-[C], with a large impulse wave [C] unfolding inside as an
impulse (1)-(2)-(3)-(4)-(5). The market must have completed correction
(4) composed of sub-waves W-X-Y. The Ripple price should be rising in
wave (5) to a level of 1.236, marked by sub-wave (3).

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] **** today:

Buy 1.090, TP 1.236

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

The ETHUSD market is forming correction B composed of three sub-waves
[A]-[B]-[C], with the final sub-wave [C] unfolding inside as a simple
five-wave impulse (1)-(2)-(3)-(4)-(5). A few days ago, the triangle
correction (4) finished, and the price resumed rising in sub-wave (5).
Wave (5) should end at a level around 4030.00. Next, there should start
a new bearish trend.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Buy 3840.85, TP 4030.00
