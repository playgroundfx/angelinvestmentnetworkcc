Euro targets the high. Forecast as of 12.05.2021Dmitri Demidenko

The correction of the US stock indexes and Treasury yield rally
encouraged the [EURUSD][1] bears to go ahead before the US inflation
report. How will the market respond? Let us discuss the Forex outlook
and make up a trading plan.

### Fundamental euro forecast for six months

While financial markets, in general, are focused on whether the spike in
inflation will be a temporary phenomenon or the US economy is on the
verge of a historic shift, Forex traders are concerned with another
question. Will the growth gap between the euro area and the US narrow?
Under favorable circumstances, [EURUSD][1] will soar to 1.25 in 2021 and
could target 1.3 in 2022. After all, the bulls first have to withstand
the release of the US consumer prices data.

History shows that a long period of high inflation is a bad time for
stocks and a terrible time for bonds. The exact changes of CPI and PCE
concern many, creating uncertainty. This, in turn, forces [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s to
get rid of both Treasuries and stocks. As a result, the Treasury yields
are rising, and the [Dow Jones][2] has had the worst [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) drop since
late February. Such an environment is perfect for [EURUSD][1] bears, who
are going ahead.

In fact, it is a common market pattern, when [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s first buy the
[news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/), the expected rise of the inflation to 3.6% Y-o-Y in April, and
then sell the facts. The reason for such a sharp surge in consumer
prices is, first of all, the low base of last year. The Fed, according
to the FOMC member Lael Brainard, will continue to be patient. Despite
the positive outlook, the risks have not gone away, and the weak April
jobs report proved it.

In my opinion, the key phrase in this speech is “positive forecasts.”
The Federal Reserve expects US GDP to accelerate 6.5% in 2021, but based
on employment statistics, the reality may be different. Too high
forecasts are difficult to be met, which is not the case when the
expectations are too low. The IMF expects the US economy should expand
by 6.5% this year; the euro-area expected growth is 4.4%. Next year, the
excepted GDPs are 3.5% and 3.8% for the USA and the euro area
respectively. The European economy should be growing faster than the US,
which will support the [EURUSD][1] uptrend.

According to Goldman Sachs, due to the acceleration of vaccinations in
the EU, the GDP should be up at 13% Y-o-Y in the third quarter, while
the US growth rate will reach its high of 10.5% in April-June quarter.
Although almost 80% of the adult population received at least one dose
of vaccine in the USA, and less than 40% of the population have been
inoculated in the EU, the euro-area vaccination rate has been higher
than in the US since late April.

### [EURUSD][1] trading plan for six months

Of course, everything could change, but there is quite a high chance
that the growth gap between the US and the euro area will be narrowing.
Furthermore, the Fed is willing to ignore the surge in the US inflation,
so the [EURUSD][1] uptrend should remain strong. It is relevant to buy
the euro-dollar on the correction with targets at 1.24 and 1.255. The
expected term for reaching the targets is three and six months
correspondingly.
