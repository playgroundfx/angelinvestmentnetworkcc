Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 12.05.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

Yesterday, the key support of the short-term oil uptrend 64.14 - 63.88
was held.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

Yesterday, the key support of the short-term oil uptrend 64.14 - 63.88
was held. A remarkable, technical “false breakout” pattern was formed,
within which the oil price rose and reached the resistance level of
65.57.

Breakout of the resistance at 65.57 will lead to a price rise to the
level of 66.54. After reaching level 66.54, the priority upward scenario
will be 100% worked out.

Today, it is profitable to hold up some of the oil purchases entered in
the key support zone. Enter new long trades on the correction.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

Hold up a part of purchases entered in the zone of 64.14 - 63.13.
TakeProfit: 66.54. StopLoss: at the breakeven.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

Yesterday, the gold price corrected to the Intermediary Zone 1823 -
1820, and an idea of selling the instrument in the correction worked
out. However, the short-term trend remains up. The priority is to search
for purchases with the target at level 1842 and in the Target Zone 2
1861 - 1856. For purchases, wait for a pattern formation, for example,
the “1-2-3” pattern.

To enter sales, a breakout of the Intermediary Zone and a further price
consolidation below at the US trading session are required.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

Buy according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 1823 - 1820.
TakeProfit: 1842, Target Zone 2 1861 - 1856. StopLoss: according to the
pattern rules.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

Yesterday, the euro price failed to consolidate above the Target Zone
1.2179 - 1.2162. As a result, the support level of 1.2128 and the
Additional Zone 1.2137 - 1.2133 were broken out. It can be concluded
that the price is trading in the correction with the target in the
Intermediary Zone 1.2093 - 1.2084.

Today, the search for euro sales with the target in the Intermediary
Zone and the level of 1.2117 is a matter of primary importance. Look for
sales entered in the zone of 1.2163 - 1.2137.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

Sell from the zone of 1.2163 - 1.2137. TakeProfit: Intermediary Zone
1.2093 - 1.2084. StopLoss: 1.2173.
