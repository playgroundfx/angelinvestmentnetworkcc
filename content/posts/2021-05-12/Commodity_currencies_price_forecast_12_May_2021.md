Central banks are leading commodity currencies into battle. Forecast for
USDCAD, USDNOK and USDRUB as of 12.05...Dmitri Demidenko

Canada is reducing QE, Norway is ready to raise rates in September, and
Russia is aggressively tightening monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). How can [USDCAD][1],
[USDNOK][2] and [USDRUB][3] not fall in such conditions? Let us discuss
the Forex outlook and make up a trading plan

## Fundamental commodity currencies forecast for six months

Don't trust your eyes, trust your ears. While some see all the signs of
a high inflation era, and some believe the Fed's word that the PCE surge
will be temporary, rational [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s hedge the risks by buying
commodities and related assets. The super-cycle in the commodity market
can last from 10 to 35 years, so the success of the oil-exporting
countries' currencies is not accidental. 33% [Brent][4] rally and
hawkish stance of central banks – what could be better for the Canadian
dollar, the Norwegian krone and the Russian ruble? The first two
currencies are confidently leading among the best G10 performers, and
even the ruble, which has fallen under the fire of the US  "nuclear"
sanctions, managed to enter the green zone against the US dollar.

At its last meeting, the Bank of Canada raised its GDP forecast for 2021
from 4.5% to 6.5%, for 2022 – to 3.75%. The BoC became the first of the
G10 central banks to normalize monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), reducing the volume of
asset purchases under the QE. Ottawa prides itself on finding a balance
between ambition and courage on the one hand, and caution and prudence
on the other. A more predictable trading environment after Joe Biden
took office in the US, favorable growth in US imports for Canadian
exporters and about CA$200 billion in household savings allow us to
expect a booming Canadian economy for the rest of the year.

Despite the fact that the debt-to-GDP ratio could jump to 51%, the
highest level since 1999, the indicator is still significantly lower
than in the US (108%) and the EU (90.7%), which makes Canadian bonds
more attractive.

Norges Bank follows the Fed's example and declares the temporary nature
of inflation acceleration, despite the fact that consumer prices in the
country have exceeded the target of 2% for more than a year. At its May
meeting, Norges Bank removed the word “significant” from the assessment
of the existing uncertainty, which allowed Nordea to shift the rate hike
expectations from December to September. Bloomberg estimates that
borrowing costs will grow by 25 bps in 2021, by 50 bps in 2022, and will
be 1.5% by the end of 2024.

The Central Bank of Russia is also fighting inflation, which accelerated
to 5.8% in March and slowed slightly to 5.5% in April. Unexpectedly for
many Bloomberg experts, the Russian regulator immediately raised the key
rate by 50 bps to 5% and warned about the possibility of applying
measures to tighten monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).

In my opinion, the Canadian dollar, the Norwegian krone and the ruble
uptrends will continue. The [USDCAD][1] pair is close to [the previously
announced target of 1.2][5]. It's time to lower it to 1.18. A break of
support at 8.18 will encourage [USDNOK][2] bears to go ahead. Even the
ruble, which is experiencing serious problems due to strained
Russia–United States relations and [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s' fears about the fate of
assets in emerging markets amid slow vaccination process, can work
wonders. I would not be surprised if the [USDRUB][3] pair reaches 70-71
this year.
