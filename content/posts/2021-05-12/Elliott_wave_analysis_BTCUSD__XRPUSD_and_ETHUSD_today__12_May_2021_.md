Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 12.05.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

Although Ethereum continued rising, I still stick to the downside
scenario. The ETHUSD bulls have been holding the price up for a long
time, and the upward momentum should exhaust soon.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

The BTCUSD market is forming the bear impulse wave, namely its inceptive
part. There has competed the down wave 1 as an impulse. The corrective
wave 2 has completed as a double combination [W]-[X]-[Y]. The price is
now declining in the initial part of the third wave, which should
consist of the sub-waves of a smaller degree (1)-(2)-(3)-(4)-(5). So
far, there have finished two small sub-waves (1) and (2). The market
should be moving towards the low of 47000.00 over the next few days.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Sell 57075.00, TP 47000.00

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

The most recent XRPUSD price chart section displays the beginning of the
upward impulse wave currently unfolding. There is developing the first
sub-wave (1), which could be a simple impulse 1-2-3-4-5. The price has
recently finished declining in the corrective wave 4, which is a triple
zigzag. Therefore, the Ripple price should be rising in the final sub-
wave to a level of 1.961, marked by wave [1] of a larger degree.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] today:

Buy 1.519, TP 1.961

## Elliott wave Ethereum analysis

The market must have risen slightly in the final leg of the global
impulse C. The final upward wave [5] of a smaller degree should have
completed as an ending diagonal. The diagonal is composed of the sub-
waves (1)-(2)-(3)-(4)-(5). Therefore, the market should shortly turn
down and start declining towards the low of 3352.00.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Sell 4243.71, TP 3352.00
