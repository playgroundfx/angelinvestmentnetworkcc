USDCAD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 20.08.21 – 27.08.21Alex
Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions from corrections above the
level of 1.2417 with a target of 1.3090 – 1.3413.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
1.2417 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of 1.2003
– 1.1850.

 **Analysis:** A descending correction appears to have formed as the
fourth wave 4 of larger degree on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) chart, with wave (С) of 4
completed inside. The fifth wave 5 has started forming on the H4 chart,
with wave 1 of (1) of 5 forming inside. Apparently, the third wave of
smaller degree (iii) of iii of 1 is developing on the H1 chart. If this
assumption is correct, the pair will continue to rise to 1.3090 –
1.3413. The level of 1.2417 is critical in this scenario as its breakout
will enable the pair to continue declining to the levels of 1.2003 –
1.1850.
