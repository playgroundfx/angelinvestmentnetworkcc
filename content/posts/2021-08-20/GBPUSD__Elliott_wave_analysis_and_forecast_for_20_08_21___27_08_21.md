GBPUSD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 20.08.21 – 27.08.21Alex
Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 1.3991 with a target of 1.3157 – 1.2827.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
1.3991 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 1.4243 –
1.4550.

 **Analysis:** Daily chart: the first wave of larger degree (1) was
formed, and a downside correction continues forming as wave (2). Wave B
of (2), supposedly, finished developing on the H4 chart. Wave С of (2)
is forming at the moment, with the third wave of smaller degree iii of C
unfolding inside. Apparently, wave (iii) of iii is developing on the H1
chart. If the presumption is correct, the pair's current fall will
continue down to the levels of 1.3157 – 1.2827. The level of 1.3991 is
critical in this scenario as a breakout will enable the pair to continue
rising to the levels of 1.4243 – 1.4550.
