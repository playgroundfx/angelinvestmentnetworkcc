The Reserve Bank of New Zealand has taken the right path but in the
wrong direction

## Will the US dollar follow the Kiwi's bad example?

Life has become so much more fun that no one dreams of a better life
anymore. The decision of RBNZ officials not to raise its main interest
rate to the only identified case of COVID-19 in the country has stirred
up financial markets. Someone had fun, someone was sad. Adrian Orr and
his colleagues became the heroes of the week, surpassing even the Fed
with its July meeting minutes. And who after that will say that one
cannot conquer alone?

Sooner or later, a person's life experience reaches such a level that it
only hinders work. Jacinda Ardern has motivated the introduction of
three days of isolation across the country due to the first COVID case
since February, with terrible consequences in countries that acted too
slowly. The nationwide lockdown began the day before the RBNZ meeting,
after which the overwhelming majority of Bloomberg experts expected the
cash rate to rise. The first among the G10 central banks. The Kiwi grew
steadily, but one infected person set back the NZD.

The regulator was ready to pull the trigger, but COVID-19 showed up 24
hours earlier. A day after the meeting, Adrian Orr, speaking in front of
parliament, said that the pandemic alone would not prevent the Reserve
Bank from raising rates. Delaying this decision in October will require
a significant demand shock. The head of RBNZ still sees the cash rate
rising to a neutral level within 18 months. Such hawkish stance makes
you wonder, what happened on August 18? Was it fear?

The Reserve Bank wanted to play with destiny but changed its mind. The
central bank explained its passive attitude by the isolation of the
Alert Level 4. However, New Zealand’s central bank governor said the
regulator would reduce the monetary stimulus to avert uncontrolled
growth of inflation. If only Adrian Orr had known that the best
protection from the inflation surge was spending money on time.

Concerns and doubts among the central bank’s hawks discourage the NZD
bulls. The New Zealand dollar started falling a day before the RBNZ
meeting amid a lower chance of raising the official cash rate, 60%
compared to the previous 100% bets. Investors are fed up with tales.

One fool makes many. So far, Jerome Powell has affirmed that the Fed
monitors the situation with the COVID, but the US economy has adapted.
The Fed will hardly abandon monetary tightening because of the increase
in the number of coronavirus cases. After all, the QE has been out of
date, and the central bank wants to buy a little time before raising the
interest rates. Moreover, the epidemiological situation in the USA can’t
be compared with that of New Zealand, the scope is different. Therefore,
the RBNZ’s cowardice looks foolish.

On the other hand, the RBNZ set a precedent. I suppose analysts should
draw parallels between the greenback and the kiwi, which used to be
rallying up and rolling down now. If the Fed announces that it will
resume its wait-and-see [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) because of new COVID-19 restrictions, the
US dollar will crash. The Federal Reserve had better say nothing. People
say money likes silence. I am silent and patient.
