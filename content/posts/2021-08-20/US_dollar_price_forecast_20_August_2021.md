Two reasons to buy dollar. Forecast as of 20.08.2021Dmitri Demidenko

A change in the Fed’s stance in mid-June broke the [EURUSD][1] uptrend.
The concerns about the Delts variant of the COVID-19 send the pair down.
Let us discuss the Forex outlook and make up a trading plan?

## Monthly US dollar fundamental forecast

The [EURUSD][1] downtrend is based on the US exclusivity and the Fed’s
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). The trends in the stock and commodity markets prove
this idea. Because of the Delta, a downturn in the Chinese economy, and
Fed’s willingness to start tapering the QE, oil, copper, iron ore, and
other raw materials are down in August, heading for the worst month
since the pandemic began, according to the Bloomberg Commodity Index.
The US stocks, on the contrary, are going up. The USA looks like a safe
haven in the storm of panic. That is why the greenback is strong.

Iron ore is down to the eight-month low, and oil hits a three-month low.
It means [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s a concerned about the future of the global economy.
Ambitious plans for its rapid recovery due to the massive introduction
of vaccines have to be postponed. More and more governments suggest a
need for __COVID-19 vaccine boosters _,_ and manufacturing companies
conduct research on how long the first two doses can protect against
COVID-19. The spread of the Delta in Asia, Australia, and Oceania means
the global economic recovery won’t be fast and easy.

I do not think the epidemiological situation in the USA is better, as
the numbers of new coronavirus cases and hospitalizations have doubled
since the last FOMC meeting. However, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s have a lot of money
because of the huge stimulus and are willing to invest all this money
into the [S&P 500][2] uptrend if there is any correction. The divergence
in the trends of the stock index and oil, an indicator of the global
economy’s state, proves the US exclusivity, pressing down the
[EURUSD][1].

Another bullish driver for the dollar is the Fed’s monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/),
which is clear from the yield spread between five-year Treasury bonds
and 30-year bonds. At the beginning of the economic recovery, the spread
is usually wide, as [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s expect that the easy money [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) will
stimulate GDP growth and inflation. Next, the spread narrows as the Fed
starts hiking interest rates to cool the economy. In early 2021, the
bond yields gap was widening as Jerome Powell, and other Fed officials
remained passive amid growing inflation. However, everything has changed
since mid-June.

### Dynamics of EURUSD and Treasury yields spread

Based on the trends of the [EURUSD][1] and the Treasury yields spread,
it seems that the ECB doesn’t affect the euro-dollar exchange rate. The
European Central Bank passed the initiative to the Fed. As I wrote
earlier, the ECB will benefit from the euro weakening.

### Monthly [EURUSD][1] trading plan

The Fed could have started tapering the QE earlier. The US central bank
wants to have room to maneuver before raising interest rates. If the
idea about the temporary nature of high inflation is wrong, they will
have to hike the rates already in 2022. Will the Delta affect the Fed’s
plans? We shall see. It is still relevant to sell the [EURUSD][1] with
the targets in the zone of 1.155-1.158.
