EUR/USD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 31/07/2020 –
07/08/2020Alex Geuta

##  **[EUR/USD][1] remains likely to grow. Estimated pivot point is at a
level of 1.1734.**

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions from corrections above the
level of 1.1734 with a target of 1.2000 – 1.2200.

 **Alternative scenario:** ****breakout and consolidation below the
level of 1.1734 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels
of 1.1584 – 1.1512.

 **Analysis:** A descending correction of larger degree presumably
finished developing on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame in the form of wave (2), and
the third wave (3) started developing. On the H4 time frame, the first
counter-trend wave 1 of (3) is forming, with wave iii of 1 continuing to
form inside. Apparently, the third wave of smaller degree iii of (v) of
iii is nearing completion on the H1 time frame.  If this assumption is
correct, the pair will continue to rise to 1.2000 – 1.2200 once local
correction iv of (v) of iii is over. The level of 1.1734 is critical in
this scenario. Its breakout will allow the pair to continue falling to
the levels of  1.1584 – 1.1512.
