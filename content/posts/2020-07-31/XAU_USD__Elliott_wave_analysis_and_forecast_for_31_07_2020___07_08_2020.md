XAU/USD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 31/07/2020 –
07/08/2020Alex Geuta

## Ascending trend of [XAU/USD][1] continues. Estimated pivot point is
at a level of 1907.61.

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions from corrections above the
level of 1907.61 with a target of 2020.00 – 2050.00.

 **Alternative scenario:** Breakout and consolidation below the level of
1907.61 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of
1861.83 – 1826.47.

 **Analysis:** The ascending third wave of larger degree (3) presumably
continues developing on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame, with wave 5 of (3) forming
inside. Apparently, the third wave of smaller degree iii of 5 is forming
on the H4 time frame, with wave (iii) of iii forming inside. The fifth
wave v of (iii) of iii is developing on the H1 time frame. If the
presumption is correct, the pair will resume growing to the levels of
2020.00 – 2050.00. The level of 1907.61 is critical in this scenario as
the breakout will enable the pair to continue declining to the levels of
1861.83 – 1826.47.
