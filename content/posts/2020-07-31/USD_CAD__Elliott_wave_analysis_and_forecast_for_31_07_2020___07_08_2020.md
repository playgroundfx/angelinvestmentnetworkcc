USD/CAD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 31/07/2020 –
07/08/2020Alex Geuta

##  **[USD/CAD][1] remains likely to fall. Estimated pivot point is at a
level of 1.3525.**

 **Main scenario:** consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 1.3525 with a target of 1.3250 – 1.3100.

 **Alternative scenario:** ****breakout and consolidation above the
level of 1.3525 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of
1.3645 – 1.3832.

 **Analysis:**  An ascending corrective wave of larger degree  (B) of 4
presumably finished developing on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame and wave (C) of 4
started forming. The first wave 1 of (C) is developing on the H4 time
frame, with wave v of 1 forming inside. Apparently, the third wave of
smaller degree (iii) of v has formed on the 1-hour time frame and a
local correction is developing in the form of wave (iv) of v. If the
presumption is correct, the pair will continue to fall to the levels of
1.3250 – 1.3100 after the correction. The level of 1.3525 is critical in
this scenario as the breakout will enable the pair to continue rising to
the levels of 1.3645 – 1.3832.
