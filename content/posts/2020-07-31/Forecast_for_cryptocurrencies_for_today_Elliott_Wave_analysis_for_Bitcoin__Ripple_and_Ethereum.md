An ascending impulse wave A is developing at the moment, with the
ultimate bullish impulse [5] forming inside.  A sideways corrective wave
(4), which is flat a-b-c, has formed within that impulse recently.
Apparently, the market is moving upwards in the first part of the
ultimate wave (5) to a level of 12,200. Thus, the price is expected to
rise in the nearest time.

An ascending trend is forming here too. A bullish impulse wave (С),
which consists of sub-waves 1-2-3-4-5, is forming at the moment. The
5-wave impulse 6 might have formed already, so the market is expected to
fall in correction 4 in the nearest time.  Once it’s completed, the
growth could continue in the final impulse 5 to a level of 0.281, as
shown in the chart.

An ascending 5-wave impulse wave A is developing, with its four out of
five parts completed. Within the final bullish impulse [5], a corrective
movement ended in wave (4) formed as a double three pattern w-x-y.  Then
the market continued growing in wave (5). The uptrend is supposed to
finish at around 360.00. Then the price may reverse and start declining.
