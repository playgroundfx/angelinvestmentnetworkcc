USD/JPY: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 31/07/2020 –
07/08/2020Alex Geuta

## [USD/JPY][1] remains likely to fall. Estimated pivot point is at a
level of 105.28.

 **Main scenario:** consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 105.28 with a target of 103.50 – 103.00.

 **Alternative scenario:** ****breakout and consolidation above the
level of 105.28 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of
106.10 – 106.41.

 **Analysis:** On the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame, apparently a descending
correction of larger degree finished forming as wave B and wave С
started developing, with wave 1 of (1) of C formed inside.

On the H4 time frame, a descending correction is forming as wave 2 of
(1) in the form of double zigzag wxy, inside which wave y of 2 is
forming. Apparently, wave (c) of y of 2 is developing on the H1 time
frame, with wave  iii of (c) formed inside. If this assumption is
correct, the pair will continue to fall to 103.50 – 103.00 once the
local correction  iv of (c) has formed. The level of 105.28 is critical
in this scenario as the breakout will enable the pair to continue
growing to the levels 106.10 – 106.41.
