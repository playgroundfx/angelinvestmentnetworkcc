GBP/USD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 31/07/2020 –
07/08/2020Alex Geuta

##  **[GBP/USD][1] remains likely to grow. Estimated pivot point is at a
level of 1.2950.**

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions from corrections above the
level of 1.2950 with a target of 1.3285 – 1.3515.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
1.2950 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of 1.2837
– 1.2641.

 **Analysis:** Presumably the third wave of larger degree (3) continues
developing on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame, with wave 3 of (3) forming inside.
The third wave of smaller degree iii of 3 of (3) is forming on the H4
time frame. Wave (iii) of iii of 3 presumably continues developing on
the H1 time frame, with wave iii of (iii) formed inside. If the
presumption is correct, the pair will continue to rise to the levels of
1.3285 – 1.3515 after the local correction iv of (iii) has formed. The
level of 1.2950 is critical in this scenario as the breakout will enable
the pair to continue declining to the levels of 1.2837 – 1.2641.
