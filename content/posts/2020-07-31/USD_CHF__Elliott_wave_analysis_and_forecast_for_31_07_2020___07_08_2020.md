USD/CHF: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 31/07/2020 –
07/08/2020Alex Geuta

## [USD/CHF][1] remains likely to fall. Estimated pivot point is at a
level of 0.9212.

 **Main scenario:** Consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 0.9212 with a target of 0.8950 – 0.8800.

 **Alternative scenario:** ****breakout and consolidation above the
level of 0.9212 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of
0.9310 – 0.9466.

 **Analysis:** The descending third wave of larger degree (3) presumably
continues developing on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame, with wave 1 of (3) forming
inside. On the H4 time frame, wave v of 1 is forming, with wave (iii) of
v continuing to form inside. Apparently, wave v of (iii) continues
developing on the H1 time frame. If this assumption is correct, the pair
will continue to fall to 0.8950 – 0.8800 once the local correction has
formed. The level of 0.9212 is critical in this scenario. Its breakout
will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 0.9310 – 0.9466.
