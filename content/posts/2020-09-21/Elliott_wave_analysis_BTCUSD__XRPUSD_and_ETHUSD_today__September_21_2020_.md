Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 21.09.2020Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I suggest entry signals
to trade each cryptocurrency intraday.

All cryptocurrency pairs are forming up waves. The Bitcoin and the
Ripple are rising in the bullish impulses. The Ethereum is developing
the zigzag-shaped motive wave [Z]. So, one could enter buy trades on all
the three cryptocurrency pairs.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

 ****

The Bitcoin market is moving in the corrective down wave. There is
likely to be forming the bearish double zigzag. Wave [W] must have
completed as a simple zigzag (A)-(B)-(C). After the impulse wave (C)
ended, which sent the price down, the market has started rising in the
linking wave [X]. Wave [X} is unfolding as a zigzag, where the sub-waves
(A) and (B) have completed, and the (C) impulse is about to finish soon.
The first four legs of the (C) impulse have completed, so the price
should be rising in the final wave 5 to a level of 11480. At this level,
the size of the wave [X] will reach 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of the
[W] wave.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today

Buy 10958.75, TP 11480.00

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

The Ripple is forming the corrective down wave as a double zigzag. Waves
A-B-C have completed in the (W) wave, which is a simple zigzag. There is
now unfolding the linking wave (X) as a triple zigzag. There should have
completed the sub-waves W-X-Y-XX, and the Z wave has just started
forming. In the next few weeks, the price should be rising in the Z wave
towards the level of 0.263.

### Trading plan for **[XRPUSD][2]** today

Buy 0.245, TP 0.263

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

The ETHUSD market continues forming the simple descending zigzag A-B-C,
where the bear wave A has completed as a five-wave impulse. The price is
now rising in the corrective wave B that is unfolding as a triple zigzag
[W]-[X]-[Y]-[X]-[Z]. The second linking wave [X] seems to have finished,
and there is now developing the beginning of the final wave [Z]. The
entire correction B should end at a level of around 400.00.

### Trading plan **[ETHUSD][3]** today

Buy 373.42, TP 400.00
