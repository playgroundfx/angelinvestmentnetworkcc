Economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the week 24.08.2020 – 30.08.2020Jana Kane

##  **Review of the main events of the Forex economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the
next trading week (24.08.2020 – 30.08.2020)**

 **Trading on key Forex [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/): next week we expect the publication of
important macro statistics from New Zealand, the US, Switzerland,
Germany, Canada, as well as the results of the economic symposium in
Jackson Hole.**

The minutes of the July Fed meeting published last Wednesday did not
provide market participants with any additional information on the
prospects for the US central bank's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). The Fed leaders did
not indicate their intentions and concrete actions following the July
meeting, reiterating their determination to maintain measures aimed at
supporting the economy in an environment when interest rates can no
longer be cut, as they are already close to zero, and the asset
portfolio has grown sharply to 7 trillion dollars.

Despite this, the dollar was able to end last week in positive
territory, breaking a series of falls over the previous 8 weeks. The DXY
dollar index rose by just over 20 points last week.

The next week will not be full of important macro statistics.
Nevertheless, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s will pay attention to the publication of some
important macro data from New Zealand, the US, Switzerland, Germany, and
Canada. Financial market participants will focus on the Fed's Economic
Symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, which will bring together
representatives of the world's leading central banks and economists.
Statements by representatives of central banks may have a significant
impact on national currencies.

 **Из наиболее значимых макроэкономических данных, публикация которых
ожидается на следующей неделе, стоит отметить следующие:**

 ***during the coming week, new events may be added to the [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) and
/ or some scheduled events may be canceled**

 ****** **GMT time**

###  **Sunday, August 23**

###  **22:45 NZD Retail Sales (Q2)**

The retail sales report is published by Statistics New Zealand. Changes
in retail sales are generally considered an indicator of consumer
spending. In general, a high value is a positive factor for the NZD,
while a low reading is a negative factor. In the 3rd quarter of 2019,
the volume of retail sales increased by +1.7%, in the 4th - the growth
was 0%, and in the 1st quarter of 2020 - it decreased by -0.7%, also due
to the restrictions imposed in connection with the coronavirus, although
in New Zealand the number of cases was minimal compared to other
countries with large economies. The NZD will strengthen if the data is
better than the previous value and above zero. A weak report will
negatively affect the NZD.

###  **Monday, August 24**

No important macro statistics planned to be released.

###  **Tuesday, August 25**

No important macro statistics planned to be released.

###  **Wednesday, August 26**

###  **12:30 USD Durable goods orders. Capital goods orders (ex defense
and aviation)**

This indicator reflects the value of orders received by manufacturers of
durable goods and capital goods (capital goods are durable commodities
used to produce durable goods and services) involving large investments.
Commodities produced in the defense and aviation sectors of the US
economy are not included in this indicator. A strong result strengthens
the USD. Previous values ​​of the indicator "orders for durable goods":
+7.6% in June, +15.1% in May, -18.3% in April, -16.7% (in March), +2.0%
(in February), -0.2% (in January).

Previous values ​​of the indicator "orders for capital goods ex defense
and aviation": +3.3% in June, +1.6% in May, -6.6% in April, -1.3% (in
March), -0.6% (in February), +0.9% (in January).

In theory, the relative growth of the indicator has a positive effect on
the dollar; the market reaction to its negative value may be negative
for the dollar in the short term. Data worse than the previous value
will also negatively affect the dollar quotes. Forecast for July: +3.3%
(orders for durable goods), +2.3% (orders for capital goods excluding
defense and aviation).

Despite the growth in indicators, it's probably still not enough to
cover their strong decline in March and April. Nevertheless, better-
than-expected data will have a short-term positive impact on the dollar.

###  **Thursday, August 27**

Annual Economic Symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, which is organized
and sponsored by the Fed. At the symposium, representatives of the
world's central banks and academic economists discuss issues of the
world economy and comment on the prospects for monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of
central banks. Statements by representatives of central banks may have a
significant impact on national currencies, including the US dollar. The
degree of this influence will depend on the tone of the statements of
the representatives of the central banks.

###  **05:45 CHF Swistzerland GDP Q2 2020**

GDP is considered to be an indicator of the general state of a country's
economy and estimates the rate of its growth or decline. The Gross
Domestic Product Statement expresses in monetary [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) the aggregate
value of all final goods and services produced by Switzerland over a
given period of time. An upward trend in the GDP indicator is considered
a positive factor for the national currency (franc), while a low result
is considered negative (or bearish).

In the previous 1st quarter of 2020, GDP declined by -2.6% (-1.3% yoy)
after growing +0.3% (+ 0.3% yoy) in the 4th quarter of 2019 of the year.
However, even such a strong decline cannot be compared with the fall in
GDP in Germany, the Eurozone, and the United States. In the 2nd quarter
of 2020, Switzerland's GDP is projected to contract by -8.7%. The data
points to a strong slowdown in the Swiss economy, which is a negative
factor for the franc.

If the data turns out to be even weaker, the franc may significantly
decline in the short term. However, one should not expect a strong fall
in the franc, as it is in active demand as a defensive asset. Better-
than-forecast data may strengthen the franc in the short term.

###  **12:30 USD The US annual GDP for Q2 (second estimate)**

GDP data is one of the key indicators (along with data on the labor
market and inflation) for the Fed in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of its monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).
Strong result strengthens the US dollar; weak GDP report negatively
affects the US dollar. In the previous 1st quarter, GDP declined by
-5.0% after growing by 2.1% in the 3rd and 4th quarters of 2019. The
preliminary forecast for the 2nd quarter of 2020 was -32.9%. The data
already takes into account the impact of the coronavirus on the American
economy. The second estimate assumes a drop in GDP in the 2nd quarter by
-32.5%. Since a strong drop in GDP has already been priced in, the
publication of data with a slight deviation from the forecast and the
first estimate will not cause strong volatility in dollar quotes. The
data is weaker than the forecast and the previous value will have a
negative impact on the dollar.

###  **14:00 USD Speech by the Fed Chairman Jerome Powell**

Jerome Powell is to speak at the Jackson-Hole Symposium on monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). Market participants are concerned about the likelihood and
degree of further easing of the Fed's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) this and next
year.

Powell's comments may affect short-term USD trading. A more hawkish
stance on the Fed's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) is seen as positive and
strengthening the US dollar, while a more cautious one is viewed as
negative for the USD.

If he makes unexpected statements about the Fed's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), the
volatility in trading in the financial markets could increase
dramatically.

###  **15:00 CAD Speech by the Governor of the Bank of Canada Tiff
Macklem**

Tiff Macklem changed Stephen Poloz as Governor of the Bank of Canada on
June 3, 2020. Macklem faces essentially the same tasks as his
predecessor in this post.

The Canadian economy, as well as the entire global economy, is showing
signs of a slowdown in the first half of this year, driven by the
downturn in business activity due to the coronavirus pandemic. Earlier
this year, Stephen Poloz said that the Canadian economy is robust enough
to keep rates unchanged despite the worsening global economy. However,
the situation is changing rapidly, and not for the better. It will be
interesting now to hear McLeam's opinion on the sustainability of the
Canadian economy and the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the central bank.

If Tiff Macklem touches on the topic of the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the Bank
of Canada, the volatility in the quotes of the Canadian dollar will rise
sharply. His harsh tone will help strengthen the Canadian dollar. The
soft rhetoric of Tiff Macklem's speech and the intention to pursue soft
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) will negatively affect the CAD quotes.

Probably, he can also provide some guidelines for [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s on the eve
of the next meeting of the Bank of Canada, which will be held in the
first half of next month (September 9).

###  **Friday, August** **28**

 **Jackson Hole Annual Economic Symposium**

###  **12:00 EUR Harmonized Consumer Price Index (HICP) in Germany
(preliminary release)**

This index is published by the EU Statistics Office and is calculated on
the basis of a statistical method agreed upon between all EU countries.
It is an indicator for assessing inflation and is used by the Governing
Council of the ECB to assess the level of price stability. A positive
result strengthens the EUR, a negative one weakens it.

In May, the HICP index (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) increased by +0.5%, in June by
+0.8%, and in July - the growth of the indicator turned out to be zero.
Preliminary forecast for August: 0%. The euro is unlikely to react very
positively to the publication of this indicator. If the data turn out to
be better than the forecast, then the euro may strengthen in the short
term. The growth of the indicator is a positive factor for the euro. The
data indicate that inflationary pressures are still low in Germany. The
data worse than the forecast and the previous value will negatively
affect the euro.

###  **12:30 CAD Annual data on GDP in Canada for the 2nd quarter**

Canada's GDP report is published by Statistics Canada. Canada's
Quarterly GDP report reflects the total volume of all goods and services
produced by Canada for the quarter (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) and is considered
an indicator of the general health of the Canadian economy.

Strong report will strengthen the CAD. Weak GDP report will negatively
affect the CAD.

The report for the 1st quarter was not only weaker than the previous
reports (-8.2% against +0.6% in the 4th quarter and +1.1% in the 3rd
quarter of 2019), but came out with a negative value. indicating that
the Canadian economy has also been negatively impacted by the
coronavirus.

If the data for the 2nd quarter of 2020 turns out to be better than the
previous value (-8.2%), the CAD may strengthen. Data worse than the
previous reading is likely to have a strong negative impact on the CAD.

###  **13:05 GBP Speech by the Bank of England's Governor Andrew
Bailey**

Andrew Bailey, who became the head of the Bank of England on March 16,
2020, replacing Mark Carney, is expected to clarify the situation
regarding the future [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the UK central bank. Volatility during
his speech usually rises sharply in pound trading and in the London
Stock Exchange FTSE if Andrew Bailey gives any hints of tightening or
easing of the Bank of England's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). He will probably also
touch on the state and prospects of the British economy, which has been
badly affected by the coronavirus pandemic and is on the verge of
Brexit, which can still happen without a deal.

If he does not touch upon the issues of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), the reaction to
his speech will be weak.
