Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 18.12.2020Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I suggest entry signals
to trade each cryptocurrency.

BTC, XRP, and ETH have completed forming horizontal corrective waves.
There are now forming bullish impulses. Let us explore each
[cryptocurrency price](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/cryptocurrency-price/) chart in more detail.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

The BTCUSD finished forming the sideways corrective wave [4] that is a
double three composed of three sub-waves (w)-(x)-(y). Next, the price
started forming the bullish impulse [5]. The third wave is now
developing in impulse [5]. The price should be running up to a level of
24320.00. Next, the market could go down a little in the corrective wave
(4).

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 22876.00 TP 24320.00

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

The XRPUSD market is forming the upward impulse wave C, where the fourth
wave has recently completed. Correction [4] is a flat, where the sub-
waves (a) and (b) are zigzags, wave (c) is an ending diagonal. The
market is rising in the final impulse wave [5]. The Ripple price should
be moving up above the high made by wave (b) that level 0.675.

### Trading plan for **[XRPUSD][2]** today:

Buy 0.581, TP 0.675

## Elliott wave Ethereum analysis

The ETHUSD is forming a bullish impulse, with the horizontal corrective
wave [4] inside, completed as a contracting triangle. There is now
developing impulse wave [5] that should conclude the entire bullish
trend. The sub-waves (1) and (2) have completed, and the impulse wave
(3) is still forming. Wave (3) should end at a level of 703.60. After
the market reaches this level, it could go down in the corrective wave
(4), as it is outlined in the chart.

### Trading plan for  **[ETHUSD][3] **today:

Buy 641.55, TP 703.60
