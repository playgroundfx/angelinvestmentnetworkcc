USDJPY: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 18.12.20 - 25.12.20Alex
Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 104.17 with a target of 101.74 – 100.00.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
104.17 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 105.63 –
106.39.

 **Analysis:** Daily time frame: presumably, a correction of larger
degree is completed in the form of wave (B). Wave (С) started to form,
with the third wave 3 of (C) developing inside. H4 time frame: the third
wave of smaller degree iii of 3 is forming with wave (iii) of iii
forming inside. On the H1 time frame, correction ii of (iii) is
completed and wave iii of (iii) is developing. If the presumption is
correct, the pair will continue to drop to the levels of 101.74 –
100.00. The level of 104.17 is critical in this scenario as the breakout
will enable the pair to continue growing to the levels of 105.63 –
106.39.
