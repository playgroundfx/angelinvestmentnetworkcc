XAUUSD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 18.12.20 - 25.12.20Alex
Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions from corrections above the
level of 1818.00 with the target of 1965.30 – 2014.94.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
1818.00 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of
1718.57 – 1669.00.

 **Analysis:** Daily time frame: presumably, the ascending third wave of
larger degree (3) formed, and a descending correction has been completed
as wave (4). On the H4 time frame, the fifth wave (5) has started
developing with wave 1 of (5) forming inside. H1 time frame: there is a
wave of smaller degree iii of 1 developing. If the assumption is
correct, the pair will continue rising to the levels of 1965.30 –
2014.94. The level of 1818.00 is critical in this scenario, as the
breakout will enable the pair to continue declining to the levels of
1718.57 – 1669.00.
