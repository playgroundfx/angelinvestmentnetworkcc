Dollar: Double, double toil and trouble. Forecast for 18.12.2020Dmitri
Demidenko

Forex often surprises us with strange, unexplained things happening on
certain days. For example, the days when market index futures, market
index [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/), stock [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/), and stock futures expire, usually
resulting in increased volatility. How will the market react today, on
such a quadruple witching day? Let us discuss the Forex outlook and make
up a [EURUSD][1] trading plan.

##  **Fundamental forecast for US dollar today**

The higher the [EURUSD][1] rises, the dizzier the bulls feel. The euro
positions, supported by a Brexit deal and all-time highs hit by the [S&P
500][2], look strong. However, everything could happen on quadruple
witching day. I mean, today, December 18, the day when [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) on the US
equities are scheduled to expire. According to Susquehanna, the number
of option contracts is up 24% from a year ago. And there are also
futures! When everyone is buying, it is an excellent chance to sell. The
quadruple witching day (this event is once a quarter) is meant to be the
last chance for [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s to make major portfolio shifts before
liquidity thins out into the Christmas holidays.

All the turbulence means headaches for traders, including the euro
bulls. The [EURUSD][1] is growing on the [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s' expectations of a
soon Brexit deal and the [S&P 500][2] rally amid the hopes for a fresh
fiscal stimulus provided by the US government. However, neither of the
positive events is guaranteed. Britain’s chief Brexit negotiator David
Frost says the talks' progress is blocked, and time is running out.
Boris Johnson threatens to ban the EU fishermen's access to the UK
waters for eight years if his fishing quotas proposal for three years is
not accepted. Emmanuel Macron argues that this will not provide medium-
term confidence for the French national fleet. And fishing isn't the
only sticking point between London and Brussels.

There is nothing more permanent than temporary. The UK criticizes the
750 billion euro recovery fund, claiming if its funds were directed to
the development of electric vehicles, it would completely distort the
level playing field. Some Senate Republicans insisted on language
ensuring that expiring Federal Reserve lending programs cannot be
revived, which sets back the agreement on a $900 billion coronavirus
economic relief bill. The matters of Brexit and US fiscal stimulus
haven’t yet been settled. The rallies of the [S&P 500][2], the pound,
and the [EURUSD][1] look surprising, providing some reasons to exit the
longs on these assets. Especially on the Quadruple Witching day.

After all, even if the US Congress approves of the new financial aid
package, and the vaccination progresses, the US GDP could quickly
rebound. If so, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s could recall the dollar smile theory. At the
last stage, the dollar should be rising, as the US economy is recovering
faster than others.

###  **[EURUSD][1] trading plan today**

BofA Merrill Lynch notes the “sell the dollar” strategy is now the most
popular in the Forex market after “buy shares.” Short positions in the
dollar hit the highest level for more than two years; why not exit some
greenback sell trades? Yes, the [EURUSD][1] has reached the [target at
1.224][3], set a week ago. Yes, the uptrend is strong, and I still
believe that the euro will set at $1.25 in 2021. But it is hazardous to
buy out the highs now. I’d rather buy on corrections.
