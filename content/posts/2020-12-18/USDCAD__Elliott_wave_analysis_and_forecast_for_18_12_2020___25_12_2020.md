USDCAD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 18.12.2020 –
25.12.2020Alex Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 1.2791 with a target of 1.2600 – 1.2400.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
1.2791 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 1.2930 –
1.2986.

 **Analysis:** Daily time frame: wave (С) of 4 of larger degree
continues developing, with the first wave 1 of (C) and correction 2 of
(C) formed inside. On the H4 time frame, the third wave 3 of (C) is
forming. Inside it, there is a wave of smaller degree iii of 3 forming.
On the H1 time frame, wave (iii) of iii has been formed and local
correction (iv) of iii has been completed, wave (v) of iii has started
developing. If the presumption is correct, the pair will continue to
drop to the levels of 1.2600 – 1.2400. The level of 1.2791 is critical
in this scenario, as the breakout will enable the pair to continue
rising to the levels of 1.2930 – 1.2986.
