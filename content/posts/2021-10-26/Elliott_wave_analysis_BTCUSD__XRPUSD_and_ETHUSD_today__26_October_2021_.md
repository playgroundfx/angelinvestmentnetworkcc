Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 26.10.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

Cryptocurrencies are moving towards the suggested targets, according to
the expected scenarios.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

The BTCUSD market continues forming corrective wave [B], namely, its
final impulse wave (C) composed of sub-waves 1-2-3-4-5. Corrective wave
4 is developing as a zigzag [A]-[B]-[C] in the (C) impulse. Impulse wave
[A] must have completed, and there is unfolding the bullish correction
[B], which could end around a level of 65565.45. When correction [B]
finishes, the market will be declining in the [C] impulse, as outlined
in the chart.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 62507.50, TP 65565.45

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

The XRPUSD market continues forming the linking upwave X as an element
of a large double zigzag W-X-Y. Wave X is developing as a triple zigzag
[W]-[X]-[Y]-[X]-[Z]. The second linking wave [X] must have completed as
a double zigzag, and the final motive wave [Z] should be unfolding as a
zigzag, as outlined in the chart. Impulse wave (A) could end at level
1.152.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] **** today:

Buy 1.124, TP 1.152

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

The hourly ETHUSD price chart displays the corrective wave B composed of
sub-waves [A]-[B]-[C]. Let us explore the final sub-wave [C] unfolding
as a five-wave impulse (1)-(2)-(3)-(4)-(5). Correction (4) seems to have
completed as a double three W-X-Y. The price is now rising in impulse
(5) to a level of 4360.00, the previous high marked by wave (3).

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Buy 4206.44, TP 4360.00
