Four reasons to buy Aussie. Forecast as of 26.10.2021Dmitri Demidenko

Improved trading conditions due to the energy crisis, expectations of
rapid GDP growth in the fourth quarter and an earlier hike in RBA rates,
and an increased global risk appetite are beneficial for the [AUDUSD][1]
and [AUDJPY][2] bulls. Let's discuss this topic and make up a trading
plan.

## Monthly Australian dollar fundamental forecast

There are always winners and losers. While the energy crisis is
negatively affecting the economies of China and the eurozone countries,
Australia benefits from its status as an energy exporter. High prices
for coal and gas lead to a decrease in the production of metals and
other raw materials and to an increase in their cost. As a result, the
[terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of trade in Australia are improving and the AUD is starting to
look undervalued. These are not the only drivers of its growth.

For 107 days until October 11, about 5 million Sydney residents were in
lockdown. Once the adult vaccination rate reached 70%, the government
lifted the restrictions. The end of the lockdown is a sure sign that
Australia's GDP in the fourth quarter will accelerate dramatically. This
is a strong argument in favor of buying [AUDUSD][1] and [AUDJPY][2].
Business activity statistics can serve as a confirmation of this
scenario. In October, the PMI in manufacturing and services reached
4-month highs, and the latter returned above the critical level of 50,
indicating expansion.

The end of the lockdown in Australia, positive statistics and
preferences due to the energy crisis allow financial markets to test the
Reserve Bank for strength. The RBA officials have repeatedly stated that
they are not going to raise the cash rate before 2024. However, interest
rate swaps signal that the rate may rise by 100 bps by the end of 2023.

For the first time since the end of February, the RBA intervened in the
foreign exchange market, buying up 3-year bonds for AU$1 billion to
reduce the yield to the target level of 0.1%. A few days before that, it
exceeded 0.2%, but the intervention of the Reserve Bank brought
everything back to normal. According to Reuters, the regulator holds
about 62% of all securities maturing in 2024. Thus, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s will think
twice before going ahead again.

Unlike the bond market, the situation is different in Forex. The
improvement of trading conditions, business activity and growing global
risk appetite (e.g. the [S&P 500][3] has updated [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) highs
several times) are encourage AUD buyers. They are not confused by the
derivatives market's belief in the Fed's monetary restriction in 2022,
or by Goldman Sachs' decline in China's GDP forecasts for next year from
5.6% to 5.2%.

### Monthly [AUDUSD][1] and [AUDJPY][2] trading plan

The upward [AUDJPY][2] trend looks especially strong against the
background of the Fed's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) normalization and the situation
on the US government debt market. The pair reached the targets at 83.6
and 86 indicated [in the previous article][4], after which a correction
occurred. It should be used to form or add up to longs in the direction
of 88.4 and 89.4. [AUDUSD][1] is quite capable of rising to 0.77. The
recommendation is to enter purchases. Strong statistics on Australian
inflation for the third quarter may cause a rally.
