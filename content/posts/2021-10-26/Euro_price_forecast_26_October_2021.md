ECB will put euro through a wringer. Forecast as of 26.10.2021Dmitri
Demidenko

Instead of breaking out the upper border of the consolidation range of
1.1615-1.168, the [EURUSD][1] pair crashed. What happened? What’s next?
Let us discuss the Forex outlook and make up a trading plan.

## Weekly euro fundamental forecast

Do not go against the central bank. Investors should have remembered
this principle forever. The desire for profit is so great that they put
the regulators to the test over and over again. Once, betting against
the Bank of England brought a lot of money to George Soros, and many
modern traders wish to repeat his success. Another matter is how central
banks will react to the financial markets’ signals. Will the regulators
take active steps? The ECB doesn't seem to be willing to meet the
expectations, and this is bad [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) for the euro, pressing the
[EURUSD][1] down below the bottom of figure 16.

The rise of the euro-area inflation to 3.4% in September and
expectations of its acceleration to a new 13-year high of 3.7% in
October encouraged financial markets to expect the ECB to raise the
rates earlier, just like they forecast two federal funds rate hikes in
2022. Investors believe in an increase in the ECB deposit rate at the
end of next year, and Germany's 2-year bond yield has jumped from -0.78%
in August to -0.66% at the end of October. As a result, chief economist
Philip Lane claims market expectations for future interest rates do not
square with the European Central Bank's guidance for the rate changes.

Concerns that Christine Lagarde will say the same at the press
conference following the October 28 meeting of the Governing Council,
and possibly declare that borrowing costs will remain at the current
level until 2024, have triggered a [EURUSD][1] sell-off. Furthermore,
the IFO business climate index for Germany has been down for the fourth
time in a row, more than Bloomberg experts suggested, hitting its six-
month low.

Markets fear that the ECB will not only start criticizing their signals
but also will not change inflation forecasts. Being sure in the
temporary nature of high inflation, Christine Laragde opens the door for
maintaining the ECB ultra-easy monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) for a very long time. It
can well replace the PEPP with the regular quantitative easing program.
Against the background of the Fed's desire to quit its $120 billion QE
as quickly as possible, the [EURUSD][1] downtrend looks more than
stable.

Remarkably, the Fed has nothing against market pricing, unlike the
European Central Bank. The market bets on the first federal funds rate
hike in the summer, the second – in late 2022. Furthermore, Jerome
Powell said in his last speech that he thinks the market generally
understands where the Fed is and what is happening.

Thus, if the Fed is supportive of [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s' expectations, the ECB is
going to put pressure on them. This circumstance clearly shows the
difference in the views of the Fed and the ECB on inflation, proving the
[EURUSD][1] downtrend is bound to continue. The bulls' inability to draw
the pair above the upper border of the consolidation range 1.1615-1.168
signals their weakness, increasing the likelihood of the further decline
towards 1.156 and 1.154 if the price breaks out the support at 1.1595.
