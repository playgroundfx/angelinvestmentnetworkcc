Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 26.10.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

Oil price reached the upper Target Zone 85.44 - 84.93.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

Oil price reached the upper Target Zone 85.44 - 84.93. After reaching
the Target Zone, large purchases were closed and a corrective model was
developed. Within the corrective model, the Additional Zone 83.69 -
83.56 was broken out yesterday. The next target for the correction is
the Intermediary Zone 82.41 - 82.16.

Today I recommend considering oil sales in correction with a target in
the Intermediary Zone. If the IZ is broken out downside with
consolidation, the short-term trend will reverse down. In this case,
sell oil with the target in the lower Target Zone 79.86 - 79.35.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

Open sell positions according to the pattern in 84.46 - 83.70.
TakeProfit: Intermediary Zone 82.42 - 82.16. StopLoss: according to the
pattern rules.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

Gold price is rising, the trend remains up. The growth target is the
Gold Zone 1818 - 1816. I recommend considering new purchases on the
correction from the impulse that began on October 22.

The trend key support is at 1795 - 1793. If this zone is broken out
downside with price consolidation, the trend will reverse down, and the
target for sales will be the lower Target Zone 1776 - 1772.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

Buy at 1796.8. TakeProfit: Gold Zone 1818 — 1816. StopLoss: 1788.0.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

The euro broke out the Additional Zone 1.1621 - 1.1616 and went into a
deep correction to a short-term uptrend. The probable target of the
correction is the Intermediary Zone 1.1577 - 1.1568. After the IZ test,
I recommend looking for new purchases according to the pattern with the
target at level 1.1664. The main target of the trend is the upper Target
Zone 1.1718 - 1.1700.

Today as a part of the correction development, it is possible to
consider sales in the Additional Zone 1.1639 - 1.1634 with a target at
the trend key support.

If, during the price decline, the Intermediary Zone is broken out, and
the price consolidates below, then the short-term trend will reverse
down. In this case, look for euro sales with a target in the lower
Target Zone.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

Sell according to the pattern in Additional Zone 1.1639 - 1.1634.
TakeProfit: Intermediary Zone 1.1577 - 1.1568. StopLoss: according to
the pattern rules.
