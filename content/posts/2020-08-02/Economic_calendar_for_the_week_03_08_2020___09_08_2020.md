Economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the week 03.08.2020 – 09.08.2020Jana Kane

##  **Overview of the main events of the Forex economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the
next trading week 03.08.2020 – 09.08.2020**

 **Trading on key Forex [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/): we are expecting the publication of
important macro statistics from the US, Australia, New Zealand,
Eurozone, Japan, Canada, as well as the results of the meetings of the
RBA and Bank of England.**

The dollar continued to decline last week. The DXY dollar index updated
June 2018 lows, falling to 92.52.

European stock indices also ended last week in the negative territory,
while American indices rose.

Investors focused on the deteriorating epidemiological situation in the
United States, weakening demand and high unemployment.

Last Wednesday, the leaders of the American central bank confirmed their
readiness to keep rates near zero and buy Treasury bonds and a number of
other securities, doing everything possible to support the economy in
the context of the crisis caused by the Covid-19 epidemic. "The
trajectory of the economy will be highly dependent on the trajectory of
the virus," said Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, adding that "this is very
fundamental."

Amid pessimistic [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) sentiment and soft policies from the Fed and
other major global central banks, the gold price hit record highs last
week, rising to $1,983.00 an ounce.

The focus of [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s next week will be on the publication of data from
the US labor market, as well as the results of the meetings of the
central banks of the UK and Australia.

Investors will also pay attention to the publication of several
important macro data on the US, Australia, New Zealand, Eurozone, Japan,
and Canada.

 _ **Traders should pay attention to the following significant
macroeconomic data expected next week:**_

 *** during the coming week new events may be added to the [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) and
scheduled events may be canceled**

 ****** **GMT time**

###  **Monday, August 3**

###  **14:00 USD ISM Manufacturing Employment Index. ISM Manufacturing
PMI**

Employment Index, an important indicator of US economic conditions, is
published by the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) and reflects
business conditions in the US manufacturing sector, taking into account
expectations of future output, new orders, stocks, employment, and
supply. The ISM Manufacturing Employment Index is considered an
important leading indicator in the US Department of Labor's employment
report. A high index value strengthens the USD, while a low value
weakens it. In May, the value of the indicator was 32.1, in June 42.1.
Forecast for July: 34.4.

The growth of the index is a positive factor for the USD. However, the
index is significantly lower than the average annual values, and in the
current conditions of the coronavirus pandemic and continuing
quarantine, another decrease in the index is possible, which will
negatively affect the dollar.

The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) Manufacturing PMI is an
important indicator of the health of the American economy as a whole. A
result above 50 is seen as positive and strengthens the USD, one below
50 as negative for the US dollar. Forecast: 48.4.0 in July (against 52.6
in June, 43.1 in May, 41.5 in April, 49.1 in March, 50.1 in February).
The relative decline in the index may negatively affect the dollar,
while the value of the index itself is still below 50, which may also
negatively affect the dollar. Data below 50 indicates a slowdown in
activity, which negatively affects the quotes of the national currency.
If the indicator grows above the forecast and the value of 50, the
dollar will receive more tangible support and is likely to strengthen.

###  **Tuesday, August 4**

###  **00:30** **AUD Retail Sales Index**

The Retail Sales Index is published monthly by the Australian Bureau of
Statistics and measures total retail sales. The index is often
considered an indicator of consumer confidence and reflects the health
of the retail sector in the near term. Index growth is usually positive
for the AUD; a decrease in the indicator will negatively affect the AUD.
The previous value of the index (in May) was +16.9% after falling by
-17.7% in April. If the June data turn out to be weaker than the
previous value, the AUD may sharply decline in the short term. Forecast:
+2.4%.

###  **01:30 AUD Balance of Trade**

This indicator measures the ratio between Australia's export and import
volumes. Growth in exports from Australia leads to an increase in the
trade surplus, which has a positive impact on the AUD. Forecast for
June: A$8.763 billion (previous A$8.025 billion). The growing trade
surplus is likely to have a positive impact on the Australian dollar.

###  **04:30 AUD Interest rate decision. Accompanying statement of the
RBA**

In March, the RBA made 2 rate cuts, bringing it to the current level of
0.25%, and launched a quantitative easing program. At the same time, for
3-year government bonds of Australia, the target yield level is set at
0.25%. The RBA has launched a program of lending to the banking system
in the amount of at least A$90 billion and intends to buy bonds for A$5
billion.

The negative forecasts of economists suggest that the Australian economy
will contract by 6% in 2020, which will be the sharpest annual GDP
contraction since the Great Depression of the 1920s. The unemployment
rate is likely to rise to around 8.5%.

Some economists have talked about Australia entering its first recession
in nearly 30 years, which could turn into a depression.

“We live in extraordinary and difficult times,” said central bank
governor Philip Lowe. In his opinion, "further stimulation is needed."
He stated this during a press conference on March 19, when the RBA
lowered the interest rate during its unscheduled meeting.

Philip Lowe had repeatedly stated earlier that the central bank is ready
to lower the rate again if necessary, although the likelihood of
introducing negative rates, in his opinion, is “extremely small”.

The main negative factors for the Australian economy are weak wage
growth, a weak labor market and a slowdown in growth. Annual inflation
has remained below the RBA's target range of 2-3% for almost four years.

Unemployment in the country remains above the 5% level for many years,
unwilling to decline. Now the coronavirus pandemic has been added to the
above negative factors, which has already hit the tourism and transport
sectors hard. The RBA also expresses concerns that unemployment may rise
to 8 or even 10%.

In this regard, it cannot be ruled out that on Tuesday, August 4, the
RBA may again cut the rate. However, most economists believe that the
bank will leave the key rate unchanged at this meeting, at 0.25%, while
expressing concerns about the outlook for the global economy due to the
ongoing coronavirus epidemic.

In an accompanying statement, the RBA executives will explain the
reasons for the rate decision. If the RBA signals the possibility of
further easing of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) in the near future, the risks of a
fall in the Australian dollar will increase.

###  **22:45 NZD Change in employment levels. Unemployment rate (data
for the 2nd quarter)**

The employment rate reflects the quarterly change in the number of
employed New Zealand citizens. The growth of the indicator has a
positive effect on consumer spending, which stimulates economic growth.
A high value is positive for the NZD, while a low reading is negative.
Outlook: New Zealand employment increased in Q2, while employment rose
0.3% (against zero in Q4 2019 and +0.7% growth in Q1 2020).

At the same time, the Bureau of Statistics of New Zealand publishes a
report on the unemployment rate - an indicator that estimates the
proportion of the unemployed population to the total number of able-
bodied citizens. The growth of the indicator indicates the weakness of
the labor market, which leads to a weakening of the national economy.
The decline in the indicator is a positive factor for the NZD. Outlook:
unemployment in New Zealand in the 2nd quarter fell to 3.8% from 4.2% in
the 1st quarter of 2020.

Other indicators from the Bureau of Statistics of NZ report are also
expected to come out with a slight improvement, which is likely to have
a positive impact on the NZD. Poorly forecast data will have a negative
impact on the NZD.

###  **Wendesday, August 5**

###  **09:00 EUR Retail sales in the Eurozone**

Retail sales is a major consumer spending indicator that shows the
change in retail sales. A high result strengthens the euro, and vice
versa, a low result weakens it. Forecast for June: +19.1% (-6.6% in
annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) against +17.8% and -5.1% (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) in May. It is
difficult to predict the euro's reaction to the publication of these
values, since the data suggests that while retail sales declined in June
on an annualized basis, they rose significantly compared to previous
months, when Europe was under strict quarantine measures.

###  **14:00 USD ISM Employment Index in the services sector. ISM
Services PMI in the US economy** ****

Published by the Institute for Supply Management (ISM), this is an
important indicator of US economic conditions and reflects business
conditions in the US services sector, taking into account expectations
of new orders, stocks, employment, and supply. The ISM Services Sector
Employment Index is considered an important leading indicator in the US
Department of Labor's employment report. A high index value strengthens
the USD, while a low value weakens it. In May this indicator came out
with a value of 31.8, and in June - with a value of 43.1. Despite the
relative growth, the result below 50 is seen as negative for the USD. A
relative decline in the index can also negatively affect the dollar in
the short term. Forecast for July: 51.1, which is likely to have a
positive impact on the USD.

Services PMI measures the health of the services sector in the US
economy. The services sectors (as opposed to the manufacturing sector)
have virtually no impact on the country's GDP. The growth of the
indicator and the result above 50 are considered as a positive factor
for the USD. At the same time, a relative decline in the indicator or
data worse than forecast may have a short-term negative impact on the
dollar.

Forecast for July: 51.8 (versus 57.1 in June, 45.4 in May, 41.8 in
April). A result above 50 is seen as positive for the USD, which is
likely to support the USD in the short term.

###  **23:50 JPY Japan's GDP for Q2 2020 (Final Estimate)**

GDP is considered an indicator of the general state of a country's
economy that estimates the rate of its growth or decline. The report on
gross domestic product published by the Cabinet of Ministers of Japan
expresses in monetary [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) the aggregate value of all final goods and
services produced by Japan over a certain period of time. An upward
trend in the GDP indicator is considered a positive factor for the
national currency (yen), while a low result is considered negative (or
bearish).

In the previous 1st quarter of 2020, the country's GDP contracted by
-0.6% (-2.2% yoy) after falling by -1.8% (-7.1% yoy) in the 4th quarter
2019.

The data point to a quite noticeable slowdown in the Japanese economy
since the end of 2019, and this is a negative factor for the yen and the
Japanese stock market.

If the data turns out to be even weaker, the yen may decline
significantly in the short term. Better-than-forecast data may
strengthen the yen.

However, it should also be noted that in recent weeks, participants in
financial markets pay little attention to [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) and weak macro
statistics, abandoning defensive assets, including the yen, in favor of
riskier and more profitable stock market assets.

###  **Thursday, August 6**

###  **06:00 GBP Bank of England's decision on interest rate. Bank of
England's meeting minutes. Planned volume of asset purchases by the Bank
of England. Monetary Policy Report**

In March (11 March and 19 March), during its extraordinary meetings, the
Bank of England cut its interest rate twice, bringing it to the level of
0.1%, and announced its intention to purchase UK government bonds in the
amount of 200 billion British pounds, in an attempt to counteract
economic damage from the coronavirus pandemic. The central bank
announced that it would increase its bond portfolio to £645bn, then to
£745bn from £445bn at the time. "The current situation is completely
unprecedented," the new Governor of the Bank of England Andrew Bailey
said at a press conference following the March 19 emergency meeting.
Bailey said he expects a sharp economic contraction due to the
coronavirus and the Bank of England is ready to take further stimulus
measures if necessary. “No, we are not done yet,” he said. Based on
these statements by Andrew Bailey, it is fair to expect further actions
from the Bank of England towards easing its monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). It is not
unlikely that at this meeting on August 6, the Bank of England will
again undertake them, increasing the volume of purchases of bonds or
lowering the interest rate. Although, most economists believe that the
Bank of England will refrain from changes in the current monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
for now.

Also at this time, the minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of
the Bank of England are published with the distribution of votes "for"
and "against" raising / lowering the interest rate. The main risks for
the UK after Brexit are associated with expectations of a slowdown in
the country's economic growth, as well as with a large current account
deficit in the UK balance of payments.

The intrigue about further actions of the Bank of England remains. And
in trading the pound and the FTSE100 index, a lot of trading
opportunities will be there during the period of publication of the
bank's decision on rates.

Also at the same time, the Bank of England's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) report will
be published, containing an assessment of the economic outlook. At this
time, the volatility in the pound quotes may rise sharply. Apart from
GDP, one of the main benchmarks for the Bank of England regarding the
prospects for monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) in the UK is inflation. If the tone of the
report is soft, the British stock market will get support and the pound
will decline. Conversely, the tough rhetoric of the report on containing
inflation, which implies an increase in the interest rate in the UK,
will lead to the strengthening of the pound.

###  **11:30 GBP Speech by the head of the Bank of England Andrew
Bailey**

Financial market participants expect him to clarify the situation
regarding the further [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the UK central bank in the context of
the coronavirus and the slowdown in the British economy. Volatility
during his speech could rise sharply in the pound and the London Stock
Exchange FTSE if Andrew Bailey gives any hints of tightening or easing
of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). He will probably also touch on the Brexit issue. As
previously stated by the previous head of the Bank of England Mark
Carney, Britain's exit from the EU without an agreement would be "a real
economic shock."

###  **Friday, August 7**

###  **01:30 AUD RBA's Comments on Monetary Policy**

Annual inflation has remained below the RBA's target range of 2-3% over
the past several years. Weak inflation indicators are driven by slow
wage growth and persistent weakness in the Australian labor market.

Given that rates are already at record lows, the markets are discussing
the likelihood of the RBA taking additional alternative measures against
the backdrop of the economic slowdown due to the coronavirus and
restrictive measures.

If the RBA's comments on monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) contain unexpected information,
volatility in AUD trading will increase. Soft rhetoric regarding further
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) plans will be bearish for the AUD.

###  **12:30 USD Average hourly wages. Non-Farm Payrolls. Unemployment
rate**

These are the most important indicators of the state of the labor market
in the United States for July. Forecast: -0.5% (against -1.2% in June,
-1.0% in May, + 4.7% in April) / +2.26 million (against +4.8 million in
June, + 2.509 million in May and -20.687 million in April) / 10.5%
(against 11.1% in June, 13.3% in May and 14.7% in April), respectively.

In general, the figures can be described as disappointing but quite
understandable due to mass layoffs in American companies and the closure
of offices and shops due to the coronavirus. At the same time, the data
indicate a gradual improvement in the US labor market after its collapse
in previous months at the beginning of the year. Prior to the
coronavirus, the US labor market remained strong, signaling the
stability of the American economy and supporting the dollar.

It is often difficult to predict the market reaction to the publication
of indicators. Many indicators for previous periods are subject to
revision. Now it will be even more difficult to do this, because the
economic situation in many other large economies is no better. In any
case, when data from the US labor market is published, a surge in
volatility is expected in trading not only in USD, but throughout the
financial market. The most cautious [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s might choose to stay out
of the market during this time.

###  **12:30 CAD Unemployment rate in Canada**

Statistics Canada is to publish data on the country's labor market for
July.

Unemployment has risen in Canada in recent months, including amid
massive business closures due to coronavirus and layoffs. Unemployment
rose from the usual 5.6-5.7% to 7.8% in March and already to 13.7% in
May. If unemployment continues to rise, the Canadian dollar will
decline. If the data is better than the previous value, then the
Canadian dollar will strengthen. A decrease in the unemployment rate is
a positive factor for the CAD, an increase in unemployment is a negative
factor. The unemployment rate is expected to be at 12.8% in July.
