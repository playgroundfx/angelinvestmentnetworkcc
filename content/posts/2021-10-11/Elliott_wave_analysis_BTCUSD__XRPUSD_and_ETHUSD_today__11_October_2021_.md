Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 11.10.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

The cryptocurrency pairs covered in the article must continue forming
bullish impulses. Therefore, the prices should continue rising.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

The BTCUSD market must be forming correction [B] as a regular zigzag
(A)-(B)-(C). The first two legs of the zigzag have completed, and the
final impulse wave (C) is still developing. The price must continue
rising in impulse 3 to a level of 59500.00. Next, the price could go
down in corrective wave 4, as outlined in the chart. One could enter
purchases in the current situation.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 56318.50, TP 59500.00

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

The XRPUSD market is forming the corrective downtrend as a double zigzag
W-X-Y. There is forming the upward linking wave X as a simple zigzag
[A]-[B]-[C]. There is currently unfolding the final impulse wave [C].
Within the [C] wave, correction (4) has completed, so, the price should
be rising in the final wave (5) to a level of 1.276. At this level, wave
X will retrace wave W by 76.4%. One could enter buy trades in the
current situation.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] **** today:

Buy 1.155, TP 1.276

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

The ETHUSD market is forming a zigzag-shaped correction B composed of
sub-waves [A]-[B]-[C]. There is developing the bullish impulse wave [C]
composed of sub-waves (1)-(2)-(3)-(4)-(5). There should be forming the
final element of the upward impulse (3), which will end at a level of
around 3750.00. Next, the market should go down in correction (4) as
outlined in the chart. One could enter purchases in the current
situation.
