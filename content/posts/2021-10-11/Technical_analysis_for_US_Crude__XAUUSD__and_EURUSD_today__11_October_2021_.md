Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 11.10.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

After updating the local high on Friday, gold corrected back to the
opening levels of the day.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

Today oil price reached the upper Target Zone 80.34 - 79.83 within a
short-term uptrend. Further growth will depend on the buyers' ability to
break out the Target Zone and consolidate the price above. If
successful, the new target for purchases will be the Gold Zone 82.64 -
82.38.

Otherwise, there is a risk of price correction to strong support levels:
Additional Zone 79.16 - 79.03 and Intermediary Zone 77.88 - 77.63. Look
again for purchases according to the pattern with a target at the day's
high in the beforementioned AZ and IZ.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

  1. Buy according to the pattern in Additional Zone 79.16 - 79.02. TakeProfit: 80.35. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. Buy according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 77.88 - 77.63. TakeProfit: 80.35. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

After updating the local high on Friday, gold corrected back to the
opening levels of the day. Now the price is testing the zone of the
trend key support 1762 - 1755. The trend remains up.

Today I recommend looking for long gold trades. Expect a pattern
formation to enter a long trade.

If level 1755 is broken out downside, the trend will reverse down. In
this case, sell gold with a target in the lower Target Zone 1747 - 1740.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

Open buy positions according to the pattern in 1762 - 1755. TakeProfit:
Gold Zone 1786 - 1784. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

Euro is breaking out the Additional Zone. If the price consolidates
above this resistance, then the correction to the short-term downtrend
will continue with the target in the Intermediary Zone 1.1626 - 1.1617.
The IZ is the trend border which serves as EURUSD key resistance.

Today, consider euro purchases in the level of 1.1569 with a target at
the day's high.

If the price returns below level 1.1569, look for a sell pattern since
the Additional Zone, in this case, will be considered held.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

Buy from the level of 1.1569 / hold up purchases. TakeProfit:
Intermediary Zone 1.1626 - 1.1617. StopLoss: 1.1557.
