USD/JPY. Fundamental and technical analysis. Short-, medium- and long-
term forecastsMikhail Hypov

##  **USDJPY: Fundamental analysis, COVID-19, channel and trend
analysis, TM candlestick projections, actual scenarios and forecasts**

Today we’re examining another pair popular with [LiteForex][1] traders -
[USDJPY][2].

 **Fundamental analysis**

In order to provide fundamental estimations, we need to have a look at
the specifics of the Japanese economy and take a brief digression into
[history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/), namely the post-World War II period. After Japan’s capitulation
in September 1945, the country was banned from having its own army.
Military factories were either closed or restructured to satisfy civil
needs.  Even martial arts and production of famous swords were
forbidden. The situation slightly changed in 1954, when Japan’s Self-
defence Forces were established, but Japan gave up an offensive posture
officially. In 1960, Japan and the USA signed a Treaty of Mutual
Cooperation and Security, according to which the USA became de jure a
guarantor of Japan’s security. Japan wasn’t allowed to have a military
budget exceeding 1% of GDP, but in fact there was no need to exceed that
limit with such a powerful ally nearby.

The practical absence of military expenses released huge resources which
were allocated to developing the economy, buying and importing
technologies and attracting investments. It was the beginning of the
Japanese economic miracle and a step into the post-industrial era.

scenario for the coming weeks and months.][3]

Naturally, any economic growth is followed by bubbles and economic
overheating, which eventually lead to a crisis and a new economic
cycle’s start. Japan was no exception to the rule. The economic bubble
inflated in 1989 became particularly obvious in the real estate market.
One square meter cost up to $1 million in Tokyo, which was the highest
value in the world. The economic euphoria and low sensitivity to risk
had their effects. The economic bubble started bursting. In 1989, the
Japanese index NIKKEY 225 reached its peak at about 39,000 points and
then slumped (see the chart above). A decrease in purchasing power and a
shift from high risk assets put pressure on prices and raised demand for
government bonds. As a result, the yen became more demanded and grew
more expensive against other currencies.

Trying to stop the crisis in its early stage, the Bank of Japan lowered
the interest rate, bringing it to zero values. It prevented a
catastrophe, but resulted in the development of Carry Trade.  From that
moment, investing in the Japanese economy became unprofitable. It was
easier to take out a loan in Japanese yens and invest that money in
developing countries, or buy other countries’ higher-yield bonds.  An
outflow of technologies started and the economic growth slowed down. The
Japanese government did something that was later copied and is still
being copied by the USA: it flooded the economy with cheap money. That
allowed freezing the crisis, but didn’t allow the economy to develop.
Finally, instead of a crisis, the country had to face an economic
stagnation that was later called “the Lost 10 Years”. In fact, those
were the Lost 20 Years. This period is marked with a red arrow in the
chart above. Japan’s rapidly ageing population and national currency
price growth reduced the country’s competitiveness. Since the interest
rate is near zero, government loans cost almost nothing to the
government.  It creates a temptation to inflate a debt bubble. Now the
debt is fluctuating at around 10 trillion USD, which makes Japan the
largest debtor in the world in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of the debt-to-GDP ratio.

![LiteForex: Fundamental / technical analysis of USDJPY and actual
scenario for the coming weeks and months.][4]

An expensive yen hits hard Japan’s export-oriented economy as Japanese
products grow too expensive in the global market. The chart above shows
that the country’s economic health represented by the stock index
depends on the national currency’s rate. The yen’s rate and the index
had been falling during the crisis of 2008.  The rate was reduced from
0.5% to 0.1% in 2008 and to 0 - 0.1% in 2010. Those measures drove
liquidity to the market and allowed the index to recover. However, in
2016, the Bank of Japan’s rate crossed the zero line and is currently
equal to minus 0.10%.![LiteForex: Fundamental / technical analysis of
USDJPY and actual scenario for the coming weeks and months.][5]

This event is marked with a red line in the chart above. We see, it
didn’t produce the necessary effect and the yen continued consolidating.
Judging by NIKKEY 225, the negative rate stimulated the growth of
economy, but this situation was dangerous in the long term for a few
reasons:

  1. A negative rate stimulates a capital outflow.
  2. A negative rate demotivates enterprises.  Businesses and economies become less efficient. Why earn money when one can take out a free loan?
  3. A negative rate increases transaction costs. Banks no longer profit from loan granting. To compensate for losses, account service fees increase and additional commissions are introduced.
  4. A negative rate increases demand for cash. Keeping money under the mattress is cheaper. So, it stimulates an off-the-books economy.
  5. A high cost of banking services contributes to the development of alternative payment methods and appearance of money substitutes: virtual money and cryptocurrencies, which lie outside the legal environment.
  6. Liquidity trap. With a negative rate, Japan’s monetary powers are no longer able to attract new investments as there’s no sense in lowering the rate further. The trap will spring shut if a demand for liquidity rises despite the negative rate. The remaining work tool - repurchase transactions - is linked to a bigger debt increase. 

Obviously, this situation cannot last forever. The market mechanisms of
a monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) stop working sooner or later. Once a negative rate is
introduced, only money printing is left for maintaining liquidity. As a
result, confidence in the national currency is undermined. It may
provoke panicky yen sales aimed at avoiding risks, which will finally
result in a default.

 **Impact of COVID-19 on Japanese economy**

![LiteForex: Fundamental / technical analysis of USDJPY and actual
scenario for the coming weeks and months.][6]

Considering the population density, 862 deaths is a good result for the
country with the population of 130 million people. People say the
Japanese are lucky to have a weaker version of the virus. Otherwise,
there’s no explanation why Japan came out of it all virtually unscathed
when no massive quarantine measures had been introduced. An obvious
explanation is the innate discipline, high hygiene level and culture of
mask-wearing.

Japan’s Public Health Ministry asserts that social distancing alone
isn’t enough. It’s necessary to avoid the “three Cs” too: Сlosed spaces,
Сrowded spaces and Сlose-[contact](https://www.playgroundfx.com/contact/) settings. What’s more, the government’s
measures were neatly targeted: they managed to trace the first infected
people and their [contact](https://www.playgroundfx.com/contact/)s. It allowed preventing the disease from
spreading at its early stage. Naturally, it would have been impossible
if the population hadn’t been conscious enough and hadn’t reported cases
of indisposition and [contact](https://www.playgroundfx.com/contact/)s with potentially infected people to the
medical services. So, this approach helped avoid a massive economic
distress within the country. However, the Japanese economy being export-
oriented, the global economic crisis will have an inevitable impact on
Japan.

 **Technical analysis**

![LiteForex: Fundamental / technical analysis of USDJPY and actual
scenario for the coming weeks and months.][7]

[USDJPY][2]’s 12-month chart is displayed above.  Globally, the yen’s
trend towards rising has been kept, but the angle of incline has changed
over the past decades. On the whole, the rate has been fluctuating at
75.50 - 132 USD/JPY. A strong support level at around 101.85 [USDJPY][2]
is clearly seen inside the channel. This level should be considered in
short-term trading.

 **Actual scenario for up to the end of 2020**

![LiteForex: Fundamental / technical analysis of USDJPY and actual
scenario for the coming weeks and months.][8]

Locally, [USDJPY][2] has built a powerful descending trading channel
over the past three years (blue lines). So, the ticker is very likely to
continue moving inside the traded area.  The chart above shows that
[USDJPY][2] is located near a Pivot point and within the tolerance zone
of the candlestick projection. It means the equilibrium state has been
reached.  Obviously, this situation cannot last for a long time. So,
considering the global market trend and fundamental analysis, the ticker
will have tested a support level of 104 [USDJPY][2] by the end of the
year.

 **Long-term scenario**

![LiteForex: Fundamental / technical analysis of USDJPY and actual
scenario for the coming weeks and months.][9]

In the long term, [USDJPY][2] looks stable. The rate may continue
consolidating up to the level of 101.85 this year after having retested
the level of 104 [USDJPY][2] . This value is unlikely to be broken out:
the Central Bank has sufficient reserves and experience to hold the
rate. If the pair doesn’t drop below that support line, the rate is
likely to be consolidating inside a global triangle the next 10-20
years. An exit may be possible due to fundamental factors - a liquidity
trap or a government debt default.

 **Short-term and medium-term trading**

![LiteForex: Fundamental / technical analysis of USDJPY and actual
scenario for the coming weeks and months.][10]

[USDJPY][2] is directed upwards. Bulls’ closest target is at 108.60.
Short positions may be opened at around 109 - 110 [USDJPY][2] with a
medium-term target at 105 yens for one greenback.  Such a position can
be opened using LiteForex’s tools. If you still aren’t a trader, it’s
