Economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the week 25.05.2020 – 31.05.2020Jana Kane

##  **Overview of the main events of the Forex economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the
next trading week 25.05.2020 to 31.05.2020**

 **Trading on key Forex [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/): we are expecting the publication of
important macro statistics from Germany, Canada, the Eurozone, the US,
and Japan.**

Despite another increase in trade and political tensions in relations
between the United States and China, major US stock indexes ended the
past week in positive territory, which cannot be said about the dollar.
The DXY dollar index fell over the week, although the dollar
strengthened in the last two days of the week.

Investors remain cautious after the US President Donald Trump accused
China of "pain and massacres around the world." On Wednesday, the US
Senate approved the bill, by which Chinese companies may be forced to
refuse to register on the US stock exchanges. And on Thursday, after
China signaled that it would introduce new national security laws in
Hong Kong, the US State Department warned Beijing of the consequences of
continuing to pursue a [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) that could undermine Hong Kong’s autonomy
and force the United States to act.

Demand for defensive assets such as gold and the yen remains at a high
level. At the same time, the dynamics of the dollar in the near future
is likely to be determined by the dynamics of the US stock indices.

Their growth has so far stalled due to reports casting doubt on the
effectiveness of the anticipated coronavirus drug. Progress in vaccine
development could be a critical factor in further economic and financial
recovery.

Nevertheless, a confident breakthrough by the S&P500 index of the
resistance level of 3000.0 will trigger the weakening of the dollar.

The next week will not have much important macro statistics releases.
Nevertheless, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s will most pay attention to Thursday's
publication of data from the US labor market and US annual GDP for the
1st quarter, as well as a preliminary assessment of consumer inflation
in the Eurozone in May. Eurozone CPI indices will be published on
Friday.

 _ **Traders should pay attention to the following significant
macroeconomic data expected next week:**_

 *** during the coming week new events may be added to the [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) and
scheduled events may be canceled**

 ****** **GMT time**

###  **Monday, May 25**

No important macro statistics planned to be released. It’s a bank
holiday in the UK and Memorial Day in the US. Therefore trading volumes
on Monday during European and American trading sessions will be low.

Nevertheless, traders should pay attention at 17:30 (GMT) to the speech
by the head of the Bank of Canada Stephen Poloz. Annual inflation in
Canada in April reached a negative level. The last time the annual fall
in consumer prices occurred in September 2009. The Canadian economy, as
well as the entire global economy, is showing signs of slowdown in the
first half of this year due to a decline in business activity caused by
the coronavirus pandemic. Earlier this year, Stephen Poloz said that the
Canadian economy is quite stable, which allows you to keep rates
unchanged, despite the worsening situation in the global economy.
However, the situation is rapidly changing, and not for the better. It
will now be interesting to hear Poloz's opinion regarding the stability
of the Canadian economy and the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the central bank. If
Stephen Poloz touches on the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the Bank of Canada, the
volatility in the Canadian dollar quotes will increase sharply. The
harsh tone of his speech will strengthen the Canadian dollar. The soft
rhetoric of Stephen Poloz’s speech and the intention to pursue a soft
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) will negatively affect the CAD quotes.

It may also provide some guidance for [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s on the eve of the next
meeting of the Bank of Canada, which will be held next week (June 3).

###  **Tuesday, May 26**

No important macro statistics planned to be released.

No important macro statistics planned to be released.

###  **12:00 EUR Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices  (HICP) in Germany
(preliminary release)**

This index is published by the EU Statistical Office and is calculated
on the basis of a statistical method agreed between all EU countries. It
is an indicator for assessing inflation and is used by the Governing
Council of the ECB to assess the level of price stability. A positive
result strengthens the EUR, a negative result weakens it.

In January, the HICP index (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) grew by +1.6%, in February
by +1.7%, and in April by +0.8%. Preliminary forecast for May: +0.6%.
The euro is unlikely to react very positively to the publication of this
indicator. If the data turn out to be better than the forecast, then the
euro may strengthen in the short term. The growth is a positive factor
for the euro. However, this is still not enough to break the negative
trend of the euro. The data suggests there is still low inflationary
pressure in Germany. Data worse than the forecast and the previous value
will negatively affect the euro.

###  **12:30 USD Initial jobless claims in the United States over the
past week. Orders for capital goods (ex defense and aviation). US Annual
GDP for the 1st quarter (second estimate)**

The situation on the country's labor market is still deteriorating. Back
in February, the initial jobless claims indicator was within its average
values ​​of 193-252 thousand. However, then the situation began to
deteriorate sharply. Over the week of March 22-28, 6.9 million claims
were submitted, then 6.606 million claims, shocking observers and market
participants. A similar indicator was published last Thursday (for the
week of May 10-15) with a value of 2.438 million claims.

The US Department of Labor data published earlier this month showed an
increase in unemployment in the country in May to the level of 14.7%.
Economists attribute this to the coronavirus, which has damaged the US
economy. Many US companies announced layoffs, and authorities ordered
non-vital companies to close their offices and stores in the wake of the
coronavirus epidemic. Current weekly growth rates of claims far exceed
the previous record level of 695,000 reached in October 1982. Then the
number of initial claims filed in four weeks was 2.7 million.

This indicator reflects the state of the labor market. An increase in
value negatively affects consumption and economic growth. Under normal
conditions, a high result weakens the US dollar, while a low one
strengthens it. However, in the current environment (the coronavirus
pandemic and a sharp economic slowdown), the reaction of market
participants to the publication of this report by the US Department of
Labor can be completely unpredictable.

###  **Orders for capital goods (ex defense and aviation)**

This indicator reflects the value of orders received by manufacturers of
capital goods (capital goods are durable commodities used for the
production of durable goods and services) involving large investments.
Goods manufactured in the defense and aviation sectors of the US economy
are not included in this indicator. A high result strengthens the USD.
Previous indicator values: -0.8% (in March), -0.9% (in February), +1.0%
(in January). In theory, the relative growth of the indicator has a
positive effect on the dollar. However, the reaction of the market to
its negative value may be negative for the dollar in the short term.
Data worse than the previous value will also negatively affect dollar
quotes.

###  **US annual GDP for the 1st quarter (second estimate)**

GDP data is one of the key (along with labor market data and inflation)
for the Fed in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of its monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). A strong result strengthens
the US dollar; a weak GDP report negatively affects the US dollar. In
the previous 4th quarter, GDP growth was +2.1%. The preliminary forecast
for the 1st quarter of 2020 was -4.1%, but actually turned out to be
-4.8%. The data takes into account the impact of coronavirus on the US
economy. However, experts predict an even stronger slowdown in the 2nd
quarter. It is likely that the publication of the data will cause a
short-term decline in the dollar. Data weaker than the forecast may even
more negatively affect the dollar quotes.

###  **23:30 JPY Tokyo Consumer Price Index (CPI) (ex fresh food)**

This consumer price index published by the Bureau of Statistics of Japan
reflects an estimate of the price dynamics obtained by comparing the
retail prices of the corresponding basket of goods and services. The
Tokyo CPI index ex fresh food, which is an important barometer of
changes in consumer trends, came out with a value of +0.4% in March, and
in April with a negative value of -0.1% (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)). Forecast for
May: +0.1%. Inflation in Japan is still low. Relative growth of the
indicator can strengthen the yen in the short term. However, a decrease
in the indicator will negatively affect the yen.

During the publication of CPI indices, an increase in volatility is
expected in the yen quotes and in the Japanese stock market, especially
if the actual values ​ significantly differ from the forecast.

###  **23:50** **JPY Industrial Production**

This indicator published by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry
reflects the volume of production of factories, plants, and mining
enterprises in Japan. It attracts attention, since it is the main
indicator of the state of the country's manufacturing sector. A high
value is considered a positive (or bullish) factor for JPY, and a low
value is considered negative. In March, industrial production in Japan
decreased by -5.2% (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)). The next drop in this indicator in
April is expected to have a negative impact on the yen.

###  **Friday, May 29**

###  **09:00 EUR Consumer Price Index. Core Consumer Price Index
(preliminary release)**

Consumer Price Index (CPI) is published by Eurostat and determines the
price change of a selected basket of goods and services for a given
period. The index is a key indicator for measuring inflation and
changing consumer preferences. A positive result strengthens the EUR, a
negative result weakens it. In January, CPI increased by 1.4% (in annual
[terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)), in February - by +1.2%, in March - by +0.7%, and in April - by
+0.3%, which indicates low inflationary pressures and even slowing
inflation. Forecast for May: +0.2% (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)). The expected data
are below the previous value, which is already negative for the euro. If
they turn out to be worse than the forecast, the euro may shortly but
sharply decline. The data better than the forecast and/or the previous
value can strengthen the euro in the short term, despite the low value
(the target level of consumer inflation of the ECB is slightly below
2.0%).

Core Consumer Price Index (Core CPI) determines the change in prices of
a selected basket of goods and services for a given period and is a key
indicator for assessing inflation and changing consumer preferences.
Food and energy are excluded from this indicator for a more accurate
estimate. A high result strengthens the EUR and a low result weakens it.
In January, Core CPI increased by 1.1% (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)), in February -
by +1.2%, in March - by +1.0%, in April - by +0.9%. If the data for May
is worse than the previous value or forecast, this could negatively
affect the euro. If the data turn out to be better than the forecast or
the previous value, then the euro will most likely react with the growth
of quotations, but only in the short term. Eurozone inflation remains
low, which is a negative factor for the euro. Forecast for May: +0.9%.

###  **12:30 CAD Canada's GDP annual data**

Canada's GDP report is published by Statistics Canada. The Canada's GDP
Quarterly Report reflects the total volume of all goods and services
produced by Canada for the quarter (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) and is considered
an indicator of the overall state of the Canadian economy.

A strong report will strengthen the CAD. A weak GDP report will
negatively impact the CAD.

The report for the 4th quarter turned out to be weaker than previous
reports (+0.3% against +1.1% in the 3rd quarter of 2019 and +3.5% in the
2nd quarter).

If the data for the 1st quarter of 2020 is stronger than the previous
value (+0.3%), the CAD may strengthen. Data worse than the previous
value is likely to have a strong negative effect on the CAD.
