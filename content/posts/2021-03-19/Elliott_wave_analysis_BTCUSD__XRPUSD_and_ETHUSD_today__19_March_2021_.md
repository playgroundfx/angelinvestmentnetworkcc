Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 19.03.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

Ethereum is about to finish the corrective wave, so the price should
soon start rising in the impulse wave.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

There is now forming the fifth wave of a large impulse. Within this
wave, there is forming the bullish sub-wave [3], which is an impulse.
After the downward correction (4) finished, there has started developing
the initial part of the impulse wave (5), which is the final leg of
impulse [3]. In the near future, the price should rise to a level above
the high at 61780.00, marked by wave (3). An approximate trajectory of
the Bitcoin future price movement is outlined in the chart.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 57552.50, TP 61780.00

* * *

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

The market must have completed the long-term corrective wave [B] as a
triple zigzag. There is now forming the initial part of the bearish
impulse wave [C]. The first two sub-waves (1) and (2) have completed, so
the price should be declining in wave (3). The target to enter sell
trades is at level 0.424, marked by the linking wave (XX).

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] today:

Sell 0.466, TP 0.424

* * *

## Elliott wave Ethereum analysis

The ETHUSD continues to rise the impulse. In the bullish impulse (5),
currently ongoing, there is developing the bearish correction 4.
Correction 4 should complete as a simple zigzag [a]-[b]-[c]. The impulse
wave [a] and the corrective wave [b] have completed. The market is now
declining in the [c] wave. The price should go down to a level of
1705.00. Next, the market will go up in sub-wave 5, as it is outlined in
the chart.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Sell 1777.61, TP 1705.00
