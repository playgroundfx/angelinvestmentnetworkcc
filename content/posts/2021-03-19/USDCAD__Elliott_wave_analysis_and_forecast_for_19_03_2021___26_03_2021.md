USDCAD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 19.03.2021 –
26.03.2021Alex Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 1.2740 with a target of 1.2300 – 1.2200.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
1.2740 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 1.2989 –
1.3308.

 **Analysis:** Daily time frame: wave (С) of 4 of larger degree
continues developing, with the first wave 1 of (C) forming inside. The
fifth wave v of 1 is forming on the H4 time frame, with wave (v) of v of
smaller degree developing inside. The third wave of smaller degree iii
of (v) appeared to have formed on the H1 time frame, and a local
correction is developing in the form of wave iv of (v). If the
presumption is correct, the pair will continue to fall to the levels of
1.2300 – 1.2200 after correction. The level of 1.2740 is critical in
this scenario, as the breakout will enable the pair to continue rising
to the levels of 1.2989 – 1.3308.
