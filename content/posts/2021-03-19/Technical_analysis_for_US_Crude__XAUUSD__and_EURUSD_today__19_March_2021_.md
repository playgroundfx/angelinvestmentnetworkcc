Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

The collapse of oil prices occurred yesterday after breaking out the
Intermediary Zone 64.16 - 63.93.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

The collapse of oil prices occurred yesterday after breaking out the
Intermediary Zone 64.16 - 63.93. The short-term trend reversed down. As
a result, the Target and Gold Zones were reached. The latter is a strong
support at 59.63 - 59.41.

For a further price fall, the bears need to break out the Gold Zone and
consolidate at the US trading session below. In this case, the next
target will be Target Zone 2 57.37 - 56.92.

Today there was a test of the short-term downtrend's border 60.79 -
60.57. This caused a certain reaction from new traders. Now the price is
falling and is trying to break out another support.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

Sell according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 60.79 - 60.57.
TakeProfit: 58.37. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

Gold is trading in a short-term uptrend, the target of which is the
Target Zone 1786 - 1776. Yesterday the price corrected to the zone of
good buy prices 1730 - 1728, which led to an opening of new long trades
by major traders.

For today, the gold price is likely to grow. The nearest target is the
resistance level of 1755.

An alternative scenario is a breakout of support at 1720 and
consolidation of the price below. In this case, it will be possible to
expect a test of the trend border 1705 - 1700.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

The euro short-term uptrend continues, the target of which is the Target
Zone 1.2011 - 1.1995. Yesterday there was a retest of the trend border
1.1910 - 1.1902. It was not possible to break out the level. The price
is growing.

1.1892. When two new highs and lows appear, it will be possible to move
trades to breakeven.

To sell the euro, a breakout of level 1.1892 and price consolidation at
the US trading session below are required. In this case, the short-term
trend will reverse down, and the target for sales will be the lower
