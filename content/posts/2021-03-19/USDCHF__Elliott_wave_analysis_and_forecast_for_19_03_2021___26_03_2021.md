USDCHF: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 19.03.2021 –
26.03.2021Alex Geuta

 **Main scenario:** Consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 0.9372 with a target of 0.9137 – 0.9063.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
0.9372 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 0.9508 –
0.9681.

 **Analysis:** Presumably, the descending first wave of larger degree
(1) of 5 finished developing on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame, with wave 5 of (1)
formed inside. An ascending correction started developing as wave (2) on
the H4 time frame, with wave A of (2) formed inside. Apparently,
downward correction is developing as wave B of (2) on the H1 time frame,
with wave a of B formed inside. If this assumption is correct, the pair
will continue to fall to 0.9137 – 0.9063 after correction b of B is
completed. The level of 0.9372 is critical in this scenario. Its
breakout will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 0.9508
– 0.9681.
