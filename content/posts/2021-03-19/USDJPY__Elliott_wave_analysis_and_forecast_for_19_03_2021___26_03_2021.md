USDJPY: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 19.03.2021 –
26.03.2021Alex Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions from corrections above the
level of 107.09 with a target of 111.72 – 114.00.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
107.09 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of 104.91
– 103.29.

 **Analysis:** Daily TM: apparently, a descending correction of larger
degree finished forming as wave B, and wave С started developing, with
the first wave (1) of С forming inside.

On the H4 time frame, the third wave of smaller degree 3 of (1) is
developing, with wave iii of 3 forming inside. Apparently, wave (i) of
iii formed on the H1 time frame. If this assumption is correct, the pair
will continue to rise to 111.72 – 114.00 once correction (ii) of iii is
over. The level of 107.09 is critical in this scenario as the breakout
will enable the pair to continue declining to the levels of 104.91 –
103.29.
