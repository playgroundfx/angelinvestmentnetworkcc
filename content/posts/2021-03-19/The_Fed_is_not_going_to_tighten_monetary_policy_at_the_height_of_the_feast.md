Fed will leave a cup with punch. Review as of 19.03.2021Dmitri Demidenko

The Fed is not going to tighten monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) at the height of the
feast

##  **No work – no** **harm**

I sometimes wonder what happened to the people who asked me the way.
Investors would love Jerome Powell to tip them off about investing, but
in fact, March's FOMC meeting didn't cast light on where to invest. The
[EURUSD][1] soared to 1.199 amid Powell's statement that the US economy
would help economically insecure countries, and then it corrected very
fast. Bears called it, and we know that a bear that learned to shout
"halloo!" will never be hungry.

The Fed upgraded its GDP, inflation, and unemployment forecasts
aggressively and left its prediction of the federal funds rate's future
movements unchanged. The reason is prosaic. The dot plot is not just a
forecast: it's a call for action. If the forecasts had been too
optimistic, treasury yields and the dollar would have soared, and
financial conditions would have worsened. That would make the central
bank's work more complicated. The Fed would rather express its intention
to make a pause than repeating the 2013 experience when Ben Bernanke
caused a "tapering" hysteria talking about QE tapering. No work – no
harm.

The US economy is at a strange inflection point at the moment. Upbeat
statistics on the labor market and other macro indicators suggest a
bright future for GDP, but employment is still 9 million jobs below the
pre-pandemic levels. Growing vaccination rates look optimistic, but
COVID-19 is far from being fully defeated. Jerome Powell reminds me of
an epidemiologist who wants to preserve social distancing measures
despite all success in fighting the virus. The Fed keeps searching for
evil in the wrong places probably, and I wonder why we are so scared of
witches and not of those who burned them alive?

The market is afraid of the Fed; I have no doubts about that when I see
the US stock indexes rallying in response to positive forecasts and
treasuries being sold out amid Powell's calm reaction to growing bond
yields. The [EURUSD's][1] rise proves that as well. The Fed Chair said
clearly that America would help everybody. Unfortunately, our biggest
delusion is that we still have plenty of time. Judging from [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/),
central banks usually take away a cup of punch at the height of a feast,
tightening monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) to avoid an inflation boost. The Fed is
looking like a person who promised to change, but you don't trust them
any longer.

Investors dream that stock indexes will be growing for a few years at
least on the Fed's ultra-soft monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) and substantial fiscal
stimuli. I once dreamt that I was eating a giant pizza. When I woke up,
I found out my pillow had disappeared. Waking up sobers. Joe Biden is
planning to raise taxes. His relationship with China isn't as smooth as
[S&P 500][2] bears would want it to be. We should learn to control our
emotions, or our emotions will control us.
