USDCHF: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 15.01.2021 –
22.01.2021Alex Geuta

 **Main scenario:** Consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 0.8976 with a target of 0.8700 – 0.8600.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
0.8976 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 0.9026 –
0.9190.

 **Analysis:** Presumably, the descending first wave of larger degree
(1) of 5 continues developing on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame, with wave 5 of
(1) forming inside.

The fifth wave of smaller degree v of 5 is developing on the H4 time
frame. Wave (iii) of v formed, and a local correction is developing in
the form of wave (iv) of v as part of wave v of 5.

Apparently, wave b of (iv) is developing on the H1 time frame. If this
assumption is correct, the pair will continue to fall to 0.8700 – 0.8600
once the correction is over. The level of 0.8976 is critical in this
scenario. Its breakout will allow the pair to continue rising to the
levels of 0.9026 – 0.9190.
