Medium-term forecast for oil, gold, and EURUSD 15.01.2021Alex Rodionov

I welcome my colleagues! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest trading
signals for traders who trade in medium-term trends.

Oil ends the current week near the resistance zone of Target Zone 4
[54.72 - 54.21].

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for next week: USCrude analysis

Oil ends the current week near the resistance zone of Target Zone 4
[54.72 - 54.21]. The medium-term trend is up. So far, there are no
reasons for a reversal.

Based on this, enter oil purchases on correction next week. The trend
key support is shifting to the [49.39 - 48.94] zone.

If the correction takes place, then the downward movement can be very
sharp. On shorter timeframes, the entry point to the sell can be
observed.

As for further price growth, the breakout of TZ 4 and consolidation
above the zone is necessary. In this case, the next target will be TZ 5
[59.82 - 59.31].

### [USCrude][1] Trading tips for the upcoming week:

Buy according to the pattern in Target Zone [49.39 - 48.94]. TakeProfit:
Target Zone 4 [54.72 - 54.21]. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Gold price forecast for next week: XAUUSD analysis

The gold medium-term trend reversed up in the first week of January. The
Target Zone [1890.8 - 1879.3] was broken out and the price consolidated
at the higher level. Now the growth target for the next few weeks is
Target Zone 2 [2005.8 - 1994.3].

Last week we observed a price correction into ​​the new key support area
[1859 - 1849]. This week the price has formed an accumulation zone with
wider boundaries [1859 - 1816] within the zone.

Look for purchases according to the pattern in the accumulation zone
with the target at TZ 2.

For sales, the price should break out the level of 1816 and consolidate
below. In this case, the medium-term trend will reverse down.

### [XAUUSD][2] Trading tips for the upcoming week:

Open buy positions according to the pattern [1859 - 1816]. TakeProfit:
Target Zone 2 [2005.8 - 1994.3]. StopLoss: according to the pattern
rules.

## Euro/dollar price forecast for next week: EURUSD analysis

Euro bears have corrected the price down to the area of ​​the medium-
term uptrend key support [1.2165 - 1.2146]. At the moment, traders are
trying to break this area out.

If the price consolidates below the zone at two US sessions, the lower
Target Zone 2 [1.1981 - 1.1962] will be within reach. The probability
will be 70%. Enter sales on correction at the nearest resistance.

However, if the price doesn't break out the support, look for a buy
pattern within the trend. If the pattern is found, open the buy with the
target at the January's high + Target Zone 4 [1.2441 - 1.2420].

### [EURUSD][3] Trading tips for the upcoming week:

  1. Buy according to the pattern in Target Zone [1.2165 - 1.2146]. TakeProfit: 1.2345. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. If the price consolidates below Target Zone [1.2165 - 1.2146], sell. TakeProfit: Target Zone 2 [1.1981 - 1.1962]. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.
