EURUSD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 15.01.21 – 22.01.21Alex
Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions above the level of 1.2110
with a target of 1.2400 – 1.2500.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
1.2110 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of 1.1971
– 1.1738.

 **Analysis:** Presumably, the first wave of larger degree 1 of (3)
continues developing on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame, with wave v of 1 forming
inside. On the H4 time frame, the third wave of smaller degree (iii) of
v finished forming, and a descending correction developed as the fourth
wave (iv) of v, presumably. Apparently, the fifth wave (v) of v is
starting to develop on the H1 time frame. If this assumption is correct,
the pair will continue to rise to 1.2400 – 1.2500. The level of 1.2110
is critical in this scenario. Its breakout will allow the pair to
continue falling to the levels of 1.1971 – 1.1738.
