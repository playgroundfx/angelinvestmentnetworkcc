Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 15.01.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

The BTCUSD and ETHUSD market situations are similar. There is forming
the final leg of a large bullish impulse.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

The BTCUSD market continues forming the bullish impulse. In the most
recent chart section, there is forming the final leg of the upward
impulse wave (5) – the initial element of wave 5, which could be a five-
wave impulse, is unfolding. The market should be rising in the sub-wave
[3] to a level of 43000.00. Next, there could be a slight decline in the
corrective wave [4]. After the [4] correction completes, the price will
resume rising in the final sub-wave [5], as it is outlined in the chart.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 38404.00 TP 43000.00

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

As it is clear from the most recent chart section, the market has
finished the upward impulse wave (1). Wave 1 of (1) is a leading
diagonal. There is currently forming the bearish correction (2) composed
of the sub-waves a-b-c. The middle part of correction (2), the sub-wave
b, seems to have completed as a double zigzag. The price should be
declining over the next few days in the c impulse to a level of 0.200.

### Trading plan for **[XRPUSD][2]** today:

Sell 0.290, TP 0.200

## Elliott wave Ethereum analysis

The ETHUSD market is forming an upward impulse wave C composed of five
sub-waves [1]-[2]-[3]-[4]-[5]. There is currently unfolding the final
wave [5], namely its final leg – impulse (5). The sub-waves 1-2-3-4 have
completed, and wave 5 has started developing. Over the next few days,
the price should be rising in wave [3] to a level of 1455.00. Next,
following a short drawdown in correction [4], the price will resume
rising in wave [5], as it is outlined in the chart.

### Trading plan for  **[ETHUSD][3] **today:

Buy 1202.47, TP 1455.00
