GBPUSD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 15.01.2021 –
22.01.2021Alex Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions from corrections above the
level of 1.3450 with a target of 1.3800 – 1.3900.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
1.3450 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of 1.3194
– 1.3068.

 **Analysis:** Daily time frame: presumably, the first wave of larger
degree (1) continues developing, with wave 5 of (1) forming inside. On
the H4 time frame, the third wave of smaller degree iii of 5 formed and
a correction finished developing in the form of wave iv of 5.
Apparently, wave v of 5 is developing on the H1 time frame, with a local
correction formed as wave (iv) of v, and wave (v) of v developing
inside. If the presumption is correct, the pair will continue to rise to
the levels of 1.3800 – 1.3900. The level of 1.3450 is critical in this
scenario as its breakout will enable the pair to continue declining to
the levels of 1.3194 – 1.3068.
