Difference between MT4 and MT5 – What is BetterOleg Tkachenko

MetaQuotes Software Corp. developed the first trading platforms to trade
Forex, CFDs, stocks, and futures in 2000 and 2001. They had relatively
few capacities of the trader terminal and didn’t become popular among
traders. In early 2002, the company presented MetaTrader 3, where the
programming language and [functions](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/basic-functions/)’ capabilities were significantly
expanded. This trading platform existed for three years.

In 2005, software development company MetaQuotes developed the
MetaTrader 4 that has been the most popular trading platform since then
due to its multifunctionality and ease of use.

> You can learn more about the MT4 [functions](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/basic-functions/) in the article [What Is
MetaTrader? Learn How to Use This Online Platform in Trading][1]

The article covers the following subjects:

An upgraded version of the trading platform, MT5, appeared in 2010.
However, the MT5 hasn’t become more popular than the MT4. Read on, and
you will learn about the advantages of MetaTrader 4 and what is special
about the MetaTrader 5 platform.

## MetaTrader 4

The MT4 was initially designed for forex retail trading. The MetaTrader
4 is so popular because it is multi-functional, user-friendly, and
mobile. The platform has an intuitive interface; it is not overloaded
with ample information, panels, and buttons. Some [functions](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/basic-functions/) are
duplicated in the menu on the toolbar and the menu called by the right
mouse button.

 **The main features of MT4:**

  * The platform is designed for Forex trading. You can trade currencies as well as CFDs on indexes, shares, bonds, commodities, and cryptocurrencies.
  * MetaTrader 4 is a mono-threaded platform for 32-bit operating systems. It will work on 64-bit operating systems as well, but there may be compatibility problems.
  * The MT4 platform supports more than 30 languages.

Another reason for MetaTrader 4 popularity is the marketing and
technical support from its developer, MetaQuotes. The software
developers team is continuously working on the upgrading and improvement
of platform code. The license is affordable for brokers, so the
MetaTrader products are more popular than other platforms.

If you want to test the MT4 [functions](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/basic-functions/) on a demo account, you can
download a desktop or mobile version [via this link][2]. Then run the
installation file - the platform will be installed within 5 minutes. In
the "File" menu, select "Open a new account" and follow the prompts. On
a demo account, you can test the functionality of placing market and
pending orders, get acquainted with technical indicators and charting
objects, and try to enter your first trades.

### Pros

 **The main advantages of the MT4 compared to other platforms are:**

  *  **It is multifunctional.** The platform has three modes of order execution; none types of orders, including a trailing stop; thirty built-in technical indicators, nine timeframes.
  *  **You can program in MQL4.** The platform allows adding custom tools – scripts, Expert Advisors, and indicators. You can also create your own trading tools in the MetaEditor.
  *  **It has a tester.** You can test manual and [automated](https://www.fintechee.com/features/automated-forex-trading/) [trading strategies](https://www.fintechee.com/forex-trading-strategies/) on the [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) data, evaluate the performance of a trading system, and record the [backtest](https://www.fintechee.com/backtesting-a-portfolio/)ing results to analyze statistics. No other trading platform, except for TM5, has such [functions](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/basic-functions/).
  *  **It provides support from the trader community.** MQL5.com is one of the biggest trader communities, where you can copy signals, discuss trades, order original indicators, EAs or trading [robot](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/automated-forex-trading-robot/)s, scripts to be developed. The MQL4 programming language is one of the most popular and convenient to develop original trading systems, which is another advantage of the MT4.
  *  **It is safe.** In MT4, the exchange of information between the trader, the terminal, and the platform servers is encrypted with 128-bit keys, based on the special algorithm using a digital signature. Even if a Trojan virus enters a computer, the platform is protected from hacking.

And one more benefit is that the trader is free for traders.

## MetaTrader 5

MT5 is a revised, state-of-the-art multi-asset platform. The MetaTrader
5 was first released in June 2010. The developers thought MT5 would
entirely replace the MT4, just like MT4 had replaced all the previous
versions.

At some point, the MetaQuotes even decided to abandon the MT4 support
and stop selling licenses to promote the new terminal modification. But
‘something went wrong.’ MT5 didn’t become as successful as the MT4
despite the updates and upgrades, so MetaQuotes decided to use both
versions.

MetaTrader 4 is still the most popular Forex trading platform. However,
if you want to get familiar with the MT5, you can download its desktop
or mobile version [via this link][3].

Next, I will cover what's the difference between MetaTrader 4 and
MetaTrader 5. I will offer some tips on which is better, MetaTrader 4 or
5, for a beginner.

### Benefits

MetaTrader 5 (MT5) is a state of the art multi-asset class trading
platform. In MetaTrader 5, the developers tried to upgrade the technical
analysis [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/), tester, and order execution [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/). Some [functions](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/basic-functions/)
are more convenient than in the previous version.

 **The benefits of MT5 vs MT4:**

  1.  **Depth of Market (DOM) data.** In MetaTrader 4, the DOM is hardly useful and is rarely employed. In MetaTrader 5, the DOM is a real trading tool. Developers added volumes that are clear in trading stocks.
  2.  **In MT5, the Depth of Market** displays the corresponding information about buyers’ and sellers’ nearest orders with a step of a price change and real volume of orders at specified quotes.
  3.  **Order accounting system.** Developers added a netting system to Metatrader 5. The chart displays only one order, which is the average value of all open positions for one asset. This is convenient because you don't need to track many transactions.
  4.  **Tester.** The multi-currency function has been added to the MT5 tester, the [backtest](https://www.fintechee.com/backtesting-a-portfolio/)ing statistics have been expanded. The results of tests and [optimization](https://www.fintechee.com/features/genetic-algorithm-for-trading/) of an EA or indicator in MT5 have become more accurate due to the introduction of forward testing. What was tested in MetaTrader 4 for 20 minutes, with the same parameters, in MetaTrader 5 is tested for 5 minutes.
  5.  **Time frames.** MetaTrader 5 includes a few non-standard time frames. In MetaTrader 4, you have to install an additional script to analyze non-standard timeframes.
  6.  **Technical analysis.** The MT5 includes more built-in technical indicators. You need to add some of them to MT4 manually. There are also two extra pending orders, Buy Stop Limit and Sell Stop Limit.

## Comparing MetaTrader 4 and MetaTrader 5

Let us compare MetaTrader 4 to MetaTrader 5: which is better? MT5 is an
upgraded new version of MT4, which is designed for 64-bit operating
systems. MetaTrader 5 is a multimarket platform.

It is faster, more flexible, and functional. Operations, which take a
few minutes to process on MT4, will take a few seconds on MT5. The MT5
platform is a multi-threaded platform.

For example, you can run the [optimization](https://www.fintechee.com/features/genetic-algorithm-for-trading/) process with the number of
threads corresponding to the number of cores. The number of pending
orders is increased; the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of order execution is also changed. All
these upgrades aim to speed up internal data transfer processes and
offer traders new multi-level tools for building complex trading
systems.

The MetaTrader 5 is a multi-asset trading platform designed to trade
Forex and non-Forex assets. The MT5 functionality with the upgraded
depth of market [functions](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/basic-functions/) allows you to make money trading futures,
[options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/), and other derivatives. You can also enter Forex trades
simultaneously.

Comparison of MetaTrader 4 and MetaTrader 5:

 |  **МТ4**|  **МТ5**  
---|---|---  
Order execution [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)| Fill or Kill| Fill or Kill

Immediate or Cancel

Return  
  
Hedging/Netting| Only Hedging| Hedging and Netting  
Number of types of pending orders| 4| 6  
Depth of Market| No| Included  
Technical indicators/chart objects| 30/31| 38/44  
Time frames| 9| 21  
Strategy tester| Mono-threaded| Multi-threaded. MQL5 Cloud Network  
Markets| Forex| Forex/Stock exchange market (stocks, bonds, futures,
[options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/))  
Economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/)| No| Included  
Built-in MQL5 chat| No| Included  
  
I will deal in more detail with some of these differences between
MetaTrader 4 and MetaTrader 5.

### Interface MT4 to MT5

How do the interfaces of MT4 and MT5 differ? It is difficult to define
the difference between MetaTrader4 vs MetaTrader5 visually. In the new
platform version, the developers focused on the upgrading of the
platform [functions](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/basic-functions/), hardly changing the interface.

There are some differences in the main menu, but the most frequently
used [functions](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/basic-functions/) remained the same. Like in MT4, you can open “Market
watch” or ‘Navigator’ windows in MT5. You can also switch on an
additional menu with timeframes and types of chart displays.

That is how the MT4 interface looks when all the main windows and panels
are opened:

That is how the MetaTrader 5 interface looks:

There are minor changes if you compare MetaTrader 5 vs 4. In MT5,
toolbar icons are larger, there are also added tabs of the “Terminal”
window.

Changes to the main menu in MetaTrader 5 compared to MetaTrader 4:

  * In the “File’ menu, you can now top up or transfer money directly in the platform.
  * The Depth of Market is added to the View menu.
  * The “Insert” menu includes two extra [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/), “Experts” and “Scripts”. There is built-in software for Algorithmic traders. Also, you can add your custom EAs in MetaTrader 5.
  * The “Chart’ menu includes more charting tools.

The “Terminal” window includes “Economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/)” and the VPS server.

  *  **Conclusion.** If you have studied all the [functions](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/basic-functions/) of the MT4, it will take a couple of hours to familiarize yourself with the MetaTrader 5. And vice versa, if you are a proficient user of MT5, you will quickly get used to MT4.

### Different Timeframes

The MT5 supports 21 timeframes, which is more than twice as many as 9
traditional timeframes supported by MT4. The 9 major timeframes, like in
MT4, are on the toolbar. To call a non-standard timeframe, you need to
right-click on the chart and select the “Timeframe” tab.

I don’t think this innovation makes sense. If there is a difference
between one-minute and two-minute timeframes for a scalper, for a day
trader, there is no difference between the timeframes of M12 and M15
minutes. Besides, you can solve the problem of non-standard timeframes
easily in MT4 by installing a script.

### Order execution [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)

There are three types of order execution in MT4:

  *  **Instant execution.** When a trader sends a request to a broker to open an order, the platform automatically inserts the current price into the order. If the broker accepts the price, the order is executed. If the price is not accepted, the order is returned with a new price; this is called a requote.
  *  **Request execution.** The order is executed at a price previously received from the broker. The trader can agree to the offered price or reject the order.
  *  **Market execution.** The [Forex broker](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/best-forex-broker-for-beginners/) decides to execute an order without agreeing on the price with the trader. If a trader places an order, this implies the early agreement with the execution price, even if it differs from the terminal price.

The broker chooses the type of order execution on the account and
indicates it in the trading conditions.

In MT5, there are some more types of order execution, which a trader can
specify in the order window:

  *  **Fill or Kill**. The order can be executed at the indicated price only in full position volume. For example, a trader wants to buy 1 lot of [EURUSD][4] at a price of 1.22543. But there are only 0.6 lots sold at this price in the market; other sell offers have a higher price.
  *  **In this case, the order is not executed.** This is the only additional type of order execution available in MetaTrader 4 and MetaTrader 5.
  *  **Immediate or Cancel.** The transaction will be performed within the existing volume; the remaining volume will be canceled. From the previous example, a volume of 0.6 lots is bought, 0.4 lots are canceled.
  *  **Return.** If the order is executed partially, the remaining volume is not canceled; it remains in the market.

Traders didn’t pay much attention to the improvements introduced in
MetaTrader. Speed is crucial in trading, so One-Click trading is
popular. In ECN markets with high liquidity, the price changes in a few
milliseconds, and there is always sufficient volume in the market at the
current price.

In MT5, the developers made the process of sending orders more
complicated. Therefore, it is difficult to say what is better MT4 or
MT5, in relation to the order execution [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).

  *  **Conclusion.** MetaTrader 4 vs MetaTrader 5, in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of order execution [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). The MetaTrader 5 advantage is the ability to adjust the principle of full or partial order execution. However, only professionals use this option, which are not the majority.

In [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of order execution, I recommend [beginners](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-for-beginners/) choose the MT4 – the
fewer [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/), the easier you will understand the platform’s basics.

### Hedging/Netting

In MetaTrader 4, you can open as many orders as you want on the same
chart. Each new trade is a new order. Such a system allows you to employ
locking, open an opposite position with the same volume for a temporary
price reversal to pass.

In MetaTrader 5, the developers wanted to change the common system
employing the so-called average order accounting system. A trader could
open any number of positions on one chart, but all of them were summed
up into one order using the offset method. Locking was impossible in
this situation, which was the reason to criticize the platform. Only six
years later, in 2016, MetaQuotes introduced the changes so that the
platform now supports two order accounting systems.

  *  **The Hedging mode allows you to open any number of positions for one asset.** You can’t change the volume of the opened position, you can only enter more trades. The hedging system is supported by MetaTrader 4, and, since 2016, by MetaTrader 5.
  *  **The Netting mode allows you to have only one open position of a financial instrument at a time.** If you open a position in the same direction, both positions are summed up. If the directions are opposite, the first trade decreases by the volume of the second one; it closes completely if both trades are of the same volume; the trade turns in the opposite direction if the second position is of a greater volume.

You set the order accounting mode, hedging or netting, when you open an
account. If there is no such option, [contact](https://www.playgroundfx.com/contact/) the broker.

  *  **Conclusion. Which is better, MetaTrader 4 or 5?** Both order accounting systems have their pros: hedging allows locking; netting leaves only one order in the chart, you don’t have to track multiple orders simultaneously. So, the opportunity to choose is the benefit of the MT5.

Another moment: The FIFO rule or First In First Out. The trader has to
close the oldest opened positions first if dealing in multiple trades of
the same size and currency pair.

You can’t enter the trade the first and exit the last. This rule
operates in the USA, for example. So, for such countries, the netting
system in the MT5 is an advantage.

>  **Advice:** Open two demo accounts with both systems and compare MT4
and MT5. Share your opinion in the comments under the article!

### Pending Orders - MT4 to MT5

The number of orders in Mt4 and MT5 is also different. MT4 has four
types of pending orders Buy/Sell Stop or Buy/Sell Limit. MT5 has six
types of pending orders.

### Mobility of MT4 to MT5

There is no difference between MT4 and MT5. Both platforms have mobile
versions for Android and iPhone/iPad. The mobile MT versions fully
repeat the main [functions](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/basic-functions/) of a desktop version: quotes identity, the
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of opening and execution of orders, and so on. You can manage the
opened position using both desktop and mobile versions simultaneously.

 **LiteForex: How to install mobile version MT4/MT5 LiteForex:**

In the section “Trade Forex/Mobile Apps”, you can also find more
software for mobile gadgets, examples of [trading strategies](https://www.fintechee.com/forex-trading-strategies/), Forex
analytics, and so on. All apps are free for LiteForex clients.

### Analytics - MT4 to MT5

MT4 has about 30 in-built indicators and 33 analytical objects. MT5 has
38 in-built indicators and 44 analytical objects that help identify
financial instrument price trends. The MT5 also provides built-in
DailyForex signals. It also offers a separate economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) tab.

  *  **“Insert/Indicators”.** The “Trend” tab has six additional indicators. Apart from standard Moving Averages, [Bollinger Bands](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/bollinger-bands.html), and [Parabolic SAR](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/parabolic-sar.html), there are their modifications, such as Fractal Adaptive Moving Average, Double [Exponential Moving Average](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/exponential-moving-average.html), and so on.

There are also two new oscillators: The Chaikin Oscillator and Triple
[Exponential Moving Average](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/exponential-moving-average.html).

If you want me to dwell upon these tools in more detail, write in the
comments.

The increased variety of analytical tools in MT5 is not a significant
advantage in comparison with MT4. There are several times more custom
indicators written for MT4, more than a hundred. This is one of the main
benefits of MT4.

If you want to become an advanced trader, you can develop your own
indicators or add free custom tools. Everything added to MetaTrader 5 by
the developers, you can add yourself to MetaTrader 4.

### Algorithmic trading in MT4 to MT5

Algorithmic trading in MT5 has hardly changed compared to MT4. There are
some minor differences: the “Insert” menu has two new tabs with scripts
and Experts. There are no comments about them yet. It is difficult to
understand what is the point of these tabs if a trader can add his own
custom EAs and scripts written in MQL5.

The developers have made significant changes to the strategy tester,
which has been radically improved. In MT5, the strategy tester is a
unique tool to [optimize](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/17/added-genetic-algorithm-for-trading/) the manual and algorithmic trading of any
complexity. Its functionality outperforms the MT4 tester and the built-
in testers [Fx Blue][5] and [Forex Simulator][6].

 **What is the difference between the MetaTrader 4 tester and the
MetaTrader 5 tester?**

  *  **Speed**. Testing of an Expert Advisor, which takes about 30 in the MetaTrader 4, takes up to 10 minutes.
  *  **Optimization.** Optimization suggests testing all possible combinations of parameters to find the best combination. In MT4, only one processor core is used for [optimization](https://www.fintechee.com/features/genetic-algorithm-for-trading/).
  *  **In MT5,** developers have implemented the MQL5 Cloud Network model. It can be used to combine the power of hundreds of processor cores.
  *  **The Test Agents Manager service** allows you to use the free processing power of other community members on a paid or free basis. This technology has increased the [optimization](https://www.fintechee.com/features/genetic-algorithm-for-trading/) speed of the Expert Advisor in MT5 by hundreds of times.
  *  **Multi-currency pair [backtest](https://www.fintechee.com/backtesting-a-portfolio/)ing.** In MT5, you can test an Expert on multiple currency pairs simultaneously. It speeds up back testing procedures immeasurably.
  *  **Testing methods.** In MT5, the testing method is not based on tough control points, whose results are far from reality.
  *  **There is a forwarding testing method added.** The testing section is divided into three parts. The EA, [optimize](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/17/added-genetic-algorithm-for-trading/)d for the first two sections, is run over the last forward section. If the results are identical, the EA is [optimize](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/17/added-genetic-algorithm-for-trading/)d.

  *  **Conclusion.** Backtesting procedures in MT5 are the best and the most useful innovation introduced by the developers. In MetaTrader 4, an Expert featuring growing equity on a real account often yields losses. Or the results in real trading are far from the back testing output.

In MT5, because of the multi-thread information procedure in the MQL5
Cloud Network model, the [optimization](https://www.fintechee.com/features/genetic-algorithm-for-trading/) is several times more accurate.
So, there is a common opinion on trader forums that it is better to test
Experts and trading systems in MetaTrader 5, but it is more favorable to
enter trades in MetaTrader 4.

### WEB and Compatibility of MT4 and MT5

The web version differs from the desktop version in that it opens in a
browser. There is no need to download metatrader installation file and
install the platform. Someone sees convenience in the Webtrader, but I
consider the Web terminal a truncated version of the desktop platform.
It is convenient because it allows you to open deals with a few clicks,
but, for example, you cannot load [advisor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/expert-advisor/)s and indicators into it.

The developers of MT4 and MT5 have provided several versions of the
platforms: desktop, Web-version, mobile versions for Android and iPhone
/ iPad. Both mobile and web versions are fully compatible with the
desktop platform. A position opened on a computer can be closed from a
mobile device or browser at any moment.

The web version is not very popular: if a person has a computer at hand,
he will prefer a full-fledged desktop platform, if not, a mobile one. As
an alternative to the browser platform, I recommend that you familiarize
yourself with the LiteForex online terminal built into your Personal
Account. This is the perfect beginner trainer with basic indicators and
order opening functionality.

### Copy Trading in MT4 vs MT5

The copy-trading model is the same in both terminals. So, it doesn't
matter which terminal is connected to the social trading platform. There
are two ways to copy trades on both platforms:

1\. Copying trades and signals in the MetaQuotes community. The function
of connecting to the copy trading community is available in MetaTrader 4
and MetaTrader 5. You can use the option in the following way:

 **Step 1.** Get familiar with the signals, their providers, and
strategies. You can find signals in the “Terminal” window by clicking on
the “Signals” tab. I won’t here focus on [how to](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-trading-how-to/) choose the right signals
provider in MT4. If you need a detailed overview, write in the comments.

 **Step 2.** Subscribe to the signals you are interested in. You can
copy signals and trades only after you register on MQL5.com, which is
the entire [website](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/website-for-forex-trading/) of MetaQuotes.

This copy trading model has two major drawbacks. The first is that all
signals are paid. On the screen, you can see examples of fees: $30-$40
per month.

If the signals are ineffective, you will lose money on your subscription
anyway. Second, it is not clear how the [ranking](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/crypto-exchange-ranking/) of signal providers is
formed.

More precisely, it is formed according to the performance of the trader
providing signals. The [ranking](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/crypto-exchange-ranking/) doesn’t indicate the trader’s possible
experience. However, MetaQuotes is not responsible for it, although it
could send a risk warning concerning an investment strategy. It is
hardly possible to find out if it is a real trader or a bot wasting your
money.

However, there is another more beneficial way to start copying
successful trades:

 **2\. Copying trades using the broker's social trading system.** This
model has several advantages:

  * Subscription is free.

  * The traders’ [ranking](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/crypto-exchange-ranking/) is transparent. The rating of signal providers is formed from the broker clients. And the broker is responsible for its reliability with its reputation.

  * Speed. Copying trades of signal providers with a broker depends on the broker servers. Therefore, the copying speed is higher here than when working through MT with MQL5.

You can use any terminal to connect to the LiteForex copy trading
service. You attach your account to the trader’s account and can monitor
the performance in the МТ4/МТ5 client terminal, or in the LiteForex
Client Profile. You can explore the trader [ranking](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/crypto-exchange-ranking/) [here][7]. You can
learn how the copy-trading service works [here][8].

 **Conclusion.** Neither MT4 nor MT5 is useful for copying trades. It is
expensive, there are many bots, the rating is formed according to
unclear principles, the signal providers are not responsible to the
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/). So, a better option to employ the social trading platform
provided by your broker; this way, the platform you trade on, does not
matter.

## MQL4 vs MQL5

MQL4 (MetaQuotes Language 4) is a programming language built into the
trading platform. You can use the MQL4 to write the code for Expert
Advisors, indicators, scripts, and MT4 function [Libra](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/libra-creator/)ries. The MQL4 is
based on another common programming language C ++.

The language is flexible, so you can develop simple constructions and
complex-tusk programs able to perform multiple calculations and control
individual parameters. MQL4 functionality includes tools for analyzing
current and previous quotes; it has built-in capabilities for managing
and controlling trading orders.

MQL5 is an upgraded analog of MQL4 to use in the MetaTrader 5 platform.
You can read more about the difference between MQL4 and MQL5 in the
overview[ Metaquotes languages MQL4 vs MQL5: difference & programming
[tutorial](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/)][9].

  * Conclusion. There is no consensus among traders regarding MetaTrader programming languages. Someone says that they are very similar and that you only need to study the [Libra](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/libra-creator/)ries’ added functionality and refine the code. Someone, on the contrary, believes that languages are different and you need to study each programming language in detail. 

There are even indicators written in MQL4 and run in MT5 without
changing the code. If you are a beginner trader or you do not want to
explore the code structure, use MT4 - there are hundreds of free tools
in MQL4, and more programmers know this language than the MQL5 language.

## MT4 vs MT5 FAQs

MetaTrader 4 or 5: which is better for a beginner?

It depends on your goals.

  * If you have never opened a trading platform, you can start from any version of the trading terminal. The order opening procedure, timeframes, technical analysis indicators, and charting tools are similar in MT4 and MT5. You’d better try to enter your first trades on both platforms; it will help you choose the most convenient terminal for you.
  * If you already know the basics of trading platforms and want to master [trading strategies](https://www.fintechee.com/forex-trading-strategies/) or take up [automated](https://www.fintechee.com/features/automated-forex-trading/) trading, I recommend MT4. There is more information about MT4 on the Internet. There are more scripts, indicators, and other tools developed for the MT4 than for MT5. 

MetaTrader 5 is an all-in-one platform for trading Forex, Stocks and
Futures. MT5 is a state-of-the-art trading platform for advanced traders
who are interested in new types of orders or the Depth of Market,
forward testing methods, and [optimization](https://www.fintechee.com/features/genetic-algorithm-for-trading/) of trading systems. MetaTrader
5 platform offers a turnkey solution for [mutual fund](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-vs-mutual-fund/)s, prop trading, and

## MT4 vs MT5 Summary: which platform to choose?

MetaTrader 4 or MetaTrader 5 — which one should you choose? The
developers initially assumed that the MT5, as a more advanced version,
would replace the MT4. But MT5 has just as many bugs, and the developers
have not yet fixed them.

The upgrades offered in MT5 were not sufficient to encourage traders to
translate indicators and Experts written in MQL4 into MQL5. The
advantages of MT5 are not enough to convince traders to change their
usual terminal. Therefore, MT4 is still the best platform in its
segment.

  * MT4 is the best platform to trade forex, there are hundreds of indicators, scripts, and Expert Advisors. If you are a forex trader, choose MetaTrader 4.

  * MT5 is a professional trading platform to trade futures and test algorithmic trading.

If you are a newbie and it is difficult to understand the MT4 and MT5
[functions](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/basic-functions/), you can try yourself in a more straightforward[ LiteForex
terminal][10], it has a simple, intuitive interface. You can start
trading on a demo account without registration.
