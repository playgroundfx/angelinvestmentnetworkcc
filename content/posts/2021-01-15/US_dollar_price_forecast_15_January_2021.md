Will optimists favor dollar? Forecast as of 15.01.2021Dmitri Demidenko

The EURUSD drop could suggest that the former investment ideas may not
be working. Let us discuss the Forex outlook and make up a [EURUSD][1]
trading plan.

##  **Quarterly US dollar fundamental forecast**

May the US dollar become an attractive trading asset for optimists?
According to the BofA Merrill Lynch poll, the greenback selling strategy
was the second most popular among large [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s after buying Hi-Tech
stocks. Traders were selling off the US dollar as a safe haven amid the
hopes for victory over the pandemic and the explosive growth of global
GDP. In January, the situation has radically changed; the [S&P 500][2]
rally doesn’t encourage the [EURUSD][1] bulls anymore. Why?

At the turn of 2020 and 2021, the correlation between US stocks and the
USD index reached record highs. The US stock market is traditionally
considered an indicator of global risk appetite, whose growth fuels the
safe havens' sell-offs, including the US dollar. Nonetheless, the
massive fiscal stimulus expected under Joe Biden, the rebound of the US
GDP (4.3% in 2021, according to the Wall Street Journal experts), and
the greenback’s weakening should increase the foreign [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s’ demand
for the [S&P 500][2]. The capital inflow to the USA could strengthen the
US dollar.

The growth of Treasury yields could turn the greenback from a funding
currency into a risky asset. The dollar could be more appealing,
especially compared to the yen and the euro, because the government bond
yields in Japan and Germany are lower than their US peers. As a result,
the dollar will be the favorite of optimists, betting on the global
economic recovery in 2021.

I suggest some flaws in the above scenario, at least the current
economic cycle stage. First, US equities look overvalued. The P/E ratio
is 22.3, which is close to the all-time high of 24.4, recorded in March
2000. Yes, the fiscal stimulus of $1.9 trillion, promised by Joe Biden,
easy monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), and a potential rise of the US GDP will support
the [S&P 500][2] bulls. However, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s should realize that
everything has its price to pay. The price could include the growing
taxes and the Treasury rates’ increase. As a result, the stock index
could enter a long-term consolidation, and [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s will search for
other assets, more appealing than the US ones.

As for turning the greenback into a risky asset for carry trades, it is
just an assumption without any reason. The growth of the Treasury yields
must have been temporary. The US bond yields grew amid the increase of
the papers’ supply and random comments of individual FOMC members about
a pull back on QE. As expected, Jerome Powell ruined the hopes for a
soon end QE. The Fed chairman noted that one of the central bank's main
mistakes after the 2007-2009 crisis was the too quick end of the ultra-
soft monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). It is not the time to talk about such things now;
the right moment for a rate hike will not come soon.

 **Quarterly[EURUSD][1] trading plan **

I don’t think it is the right time to abandon the greenback sales
strategy amid the hopes for the global GDP rebound. The progress in the
vaccination process will encourage the [EURUSD][1] bulls. I suggest
buying the euro on the breakout of the resistance levels of $1.218 and
$1.221 with an upside target at $1.25.
