The Fed-led pessimists will not let the US dollar come to the surface

## The higher the greenback rises, the more the Fed wants to drown it

Is the glass half empty or half full in the market now? Prices often
grow because of pessimists and fall because of optimists. In contrast to
Russia and some optimistic peers from OPEC+, Saudi Arabia decided to cut
oil production unilaterally, believing it was too early to say the
pandemic had been defeated and the global demand had recovered. As a
result, the quotes of [Brent][1] and [WTI][2] futures soared. What would
have happened if Moscow-led optimists had overtaken the opponents?

Black gold is not the only example. A weak US employment report entitled
Joe Biden to develop a new fiscal stimulus package worth $1.9 trillion,
which pushed the US stock market upwards. Jerome Powell's mention of the
US labor market's problems revived [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s' interest in US bonds.
However, both the Congress and the Fed understand that any action will
look absurd without money.

The powers that be know when to be pessimistic. One could think Saudi
Arabia's competitors would take over its piece of the pie after it had
cut production by 1 million b/d in February-March. However, the
country's budget will grow amid growing oil prices, and it may increase
production in April. Both stocks and bonds are growing amid Jerome
Powell's dovish rhetoric. It improves financial [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) and recovers the
economy. The markets' reaction is critical. As Powell says, "a lesson of
the Global Financial Crisis is be careful not to exit too early and try
not to talk about exit all the time...because the markets are
listening."

The Fed President has already got an unpleasant experience in that
regard. A couple of years ago, he provoked panic in the market, saying
that the federal funds rate was far from neutral. He sounded optimistic
back then at the end of 2018, and stock indexes went down, hoping for
another monetary restriction cycle. These days, some FOMC members behave
in the same way, discussing the US economy's vivid recovery and QE stop.
Did they forget about the 2013 "tapering" hysteria?

The Central Bank's hawkish mood helps USD and treasury bears. I don't
think the [EURUSD's][3] current descending move is an uptrend's
reversal. It's rather a drowning dollar's attempt to come up for some
time. Pessimists won't let that happen, though. The Fed knows that a
strong currency is not what a reviving economy needs. Jerome Powell and
his colleagues will remain passive for a long time not to support the
dollar. Are they right? Probably, they are. But isn't it better to live
a life that is a shame to tell, but nice to remember?
