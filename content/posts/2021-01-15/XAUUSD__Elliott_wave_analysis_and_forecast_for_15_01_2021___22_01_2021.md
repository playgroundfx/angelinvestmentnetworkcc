XAUUSD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 15.01.2021 –
22.01.2021Alex Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions from corrections above the
level of 1819.49 with a target of 2016.08 – 2073.73.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
1819.49 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of
1760.88 – 1718.57.

 **Analysis:** Daily time frame: presumably, the ascending third wave of
larger degree (3) formed, and a descending correction developed as wave
(4). The fifth wave (5) appears to be developing on the H4 time frame,
with wave 1 of (5) formed and a local correction completed as wave 2 of
(5) inside. The third wave 3 of (5) started developing on the H1 time
frame, with wave i of 3 forming inside. If the presumption is correct,
the pair will continue to rise to the levels of 2016.08 – 2073.73. The
level of 1819.49 is critical in this scenario as its breakout will
enable the pair to continue declining to the levels of 1760.88 –
1718.57.
