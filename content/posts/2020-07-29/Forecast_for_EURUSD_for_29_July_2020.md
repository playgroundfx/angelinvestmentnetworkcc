Forecast for EUR/USD: Dollar breaks the mouldDmitri Demidenko

## Fundamental forecast for dollar for today

### Every recession has its own trick

Crises are the moments of breaking memory patterns. The current economic
recession provoked by the pandemic is no exception. Take the [Dollar
smile theory][1], for example. According to it, the greenback grows on a
bigger demand for safe haven assets, falls on the Fed’s large monetary
stimuli and rises again on expectations of the US GDP’s better
performance versus its peers. July may become the worst month for the
USD index in the past decade, even more so because something went wrong
at the last stage. The mould is broken. The divergence in economic
growths is favourable to [EUR/USD][2] bulls.

Investors inevitably turn back to past experience: the 2007-2009 global
economic crisis, the Great Depression of 1930, the 1918 flu pandemic.
The previous recession is still fresh in our minds, so the Fed reacted
naturally with a large monetary stimulus. Financial markets thought of
the central bank’s 2008 success, put on rose-coloured glasses and
believed it was time to buy risks. Now  S&P 500 is concerned about what
will happen to the economy and corporate benefits in Q3. The stocks have
been outrunning themselves for a long time. The question is whether they
have got too high.

Crises do break memory patterns, but there is a moment when a new
consensus opinion of risk premiums is reached as [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s react to a
new global picture. I suppose the French-German fiscal stimulus project
was that kind of a moment. Before the pandemic, Europe had been
considered as the world’s main economic brake.  Fiscal consolidation
programs, Brexit, EU-scepticism, rumours of EU disintegration and,
finally, the export-oriented region’s distress caused by the US-China
trade wars urged speculators to sell the euro actively. The pandemic
turned everything upside down, which is clearly seen in the forward
market.

The single European currency  isn’t led by American stock indexes any
longer. What’s more, it is ready to withstand an eventual sell-out in
the US stock market. International [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s will move money from
America to Europe because of [S&P 500][4]’s correction. Meanwhile, the
dollar’s status of the world’s reserve currency will be undermined -
this is what Goldman Sachs is trumpeting. GS believes that growing
inflation and excessive government debt are the main reasons for the USD
losing predominance in Fx transactions (88%) and gold reserves (62%).

According to the Goldman analysts, at the initial stage of recession
Wall Street didn’t dare to say the Fed’s monetary stimulus would speed
up PCE and CPI because they had already made a similar erroneous
forecast in 2007-2009.  However, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s’ are changing their minds.
Inflation expectations are growing by leaps and bounds,  real US bond
yields are falling and the dollar is growing weaker. If the Fed shows
tolerance of consumer prices growth at July’s meeting, a breakout of
resistance levels at 1.1765 and 1.178 will allow [EUR/USD][2] to
continue the rally.
