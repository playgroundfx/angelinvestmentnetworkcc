The market is forming a global ascending trend. An impulse wave A, which
consists of 5 sub-waves, is forming at the moment. Corrective wave [4]
developed as a contracting triangle not long ago. Then the price started
growing rapidly in impulse wave [5]. Impulse (3) is expected to end in
the coming trading weeks. Then a descending correction (4) will start,
after which a pair may rise in ultimate wave (5) to 12,200, as shown in
the chart.

An ascending impulse wave, which started after descending correction
(B), continues forming.  Sub-waves 1 and 2 have already formed and
impulse 3 is about to finish. It may fully form at around 0.250. Then
the pair will reverse and start declining in a new bearish trend.

A global impulse wave A is forming here. It consists of sub-waves
[1]-[2]-[3]-[4]-[5]. Once the sideways corrective wave [4] formed as a
triple three pattern, the market started rising in an ascending impulse
wave [5]. A bullish impulse [5] is supposed to end in wave (5) of
smaller degree at around 360.00 in the next trading days. Then the price
is expected to fall.
