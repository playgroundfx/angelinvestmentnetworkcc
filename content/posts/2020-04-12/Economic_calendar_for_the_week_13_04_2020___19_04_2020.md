Economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the week 13.04.2020 – 19.04.2020Jana Kane

##  **Overview of the main events of the Forex economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the
next trading week 13.04.2020 to 19.04.2020**

 **Trading on key Forex [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/): we are expecting the publication of
important macro statistics from the US, Australia, Germany, as well as
the results of the meeting of the Bank of Canada at which the interest
rate will be decided.**

By the end of last week, the dollar fell and the main US and European
stock indices rose. The DXY dollar index fell 1.3%, while US stock
indices last week showed the most significant weekly increase since
1974, despite the signs of a worsening economic situation due to the
coronavirus pandemic. The S&P500 added 12% in a week, which was the
largest weekly growth in several decades, the Dow Jones Industrial
Average grew by 13%, and the Nasdaq Composite - by 11%.

Perhaps the most outstanding fact was that last Thursday the OPEC+
coalition held a teleconference, following which Saudi Arabia and Russia
decided to reduce oil production by 4 and 2 million barrels per day,
respectively. This decision will be valid from May to June. In the
future, the reduction will be 6 million barrels per day until April
2022, according to the OPEC press release. At the same time, the
Minister of Energy of Saudi Arabia said that the kingdom wants to
continue to reduce production after 2022.

The optimism of market participants was also due to the program for the
US bonds purchase in the amount of $2.3 trillion, which was announced by
the US Federal Reserve, and media reports that the EU finance ministers
agreed on a stimulus package of 0.5 trillion euros designed to mitigate
the effects of the coronavirus pandemic.

However, the peak of the pandemic has not yet passed, and [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)
optimism may again give way to pessimism. In this regard, it is worth
paying attention to the dynamics of gold, which rose by 4.2% last week
to 1683.00 dollars per ounce.

The focus of traders next week will be on the publication of important
macro statistics from the US, Australia, Germany. Investors will also
pay attention to the meeting of the Bank of Canada, where a decision
will be made on the interest rate.

On Monday (April 13th) in Europe and North America, exchanges and banks
will be closed due to Easter.

 _ **Traders should pay attention to the following significant
macroeconomic data expected next week:**_

 *** during the coming week new events may be added to the [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) and
scheduled events may be canceled**

 ****** **GMT time**

###  **Monday, April 13**

No important macro statistics planned to be released. It's Easter Monday
in Europe and North America. Exchanges and banks in these parts of the
world will be closed. In this regard, trading volumes during the
European and American trading sessions will be minimal. However, this
does not eliminate the possibility of a sharp short-term increase in
volatility “in the thin market”, for example, when unexpected [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) comes
out. This must be taken into account when drawing up a trading plan.

###  **Tuesday, April 14**

No important macro statistics planned to be released.

###  **Wednesday, April 15**

###  **12:30 USD Retail sales (Ex Autos). Retail Control Group**

This report (Core Retail Sales Ex Autos) reflects the total sales of
retailers of all sizes and types, with the exception of car dealerships.
Changes in retail sales are a key indicator of consumer spending. The
report is leading, and in the future the data can be greatly revised. A
high result strengthens the US dollar, a low one weakens it. A relative
decrease in the indicator may have a short-term negative impact on the
dollar, and an increase in the indicator will positively affect the USD.
Forecast for March: -1.4% (against -0.4% in February and +0.3% in
January).

Retail sales are the main indicator of consumer spending in the United
States, showing changes in retail sales. The Retail Control Group
indicator measures the volume of the entire retail industry and is used
to calculate price indices for most products. A strong result
strengthens the US dollar, and vice versa, a weak report weakens the
dollar. A slight increase in indicators is unlikely to give acceleration
to the growth of the dollar. Data worse than the previous period (0.0%
in January and February) will negatively affect the dollar in the short
term.

###  **14:00 CAD Bank of Canada's interest rate decision. Bank of
Canada's accompanying statement**

The Bank of Canada will decide on the interest rate. In March, the bank
lowered the rate 3 times, bringing it to the level of 0.25% to mitigate
the economic damage from the pandemic of the novel coronavirus.

In the accompanying statement, the Central Bank of Canada stated that
this "decision is aimed at supporting the financial system, which plays
a central role in lending to the economy, as well as creating the
foundation that will allow the economy to return to normal." The press
release from the central bank also said that the spread of coronavirus
and a sharp drop in world oil prices together are putting serious
pressure on Canadians and the Canadian economy.

"I will not argue about describing these actions as QE," said the head
of the Bank of Canada Stephen Poloz. If the government bond market "does
not work smoothly, with a narrow spread of supply and demand, then the
rest of the system also does not work as it should," said Poloz,
explaining the need for QE.

Initially, at least 5 billion Canadian dollars per week will be
allocated for these purposes (purchase conditions will be adjusted to
reflect the changing situation).

Quantitative easing and a significant reduction in interest rates are
supposed to help weaken the national currency.

The consequences of the coronavirus on the Canadian economy and the
country's labor market (in March, unemployment rose to 7.8% from 5.6% in
February, and the number of employees, according to Statistics Canada,
decreased by 1.01 million people), as well as weakness of the housing
market are putting pressure on the Bank of Canada to further soften its
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).

However, it is expected that at the meeting on Wednesday, the Bank of
Canada will maintain an interest rate of 0.25%.

In their accompanying statement and report on changes in monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), the Bank of Canada representatives will explain the bank’s
position and assess the current economic situation in the country. The
tough tone of the Bank of Canada's accompanying statement regarding
rising inflation and the prospects for further monetary tightening will
cause the Canadian dollar to strengthen. If the Bank of Canada signals a
soft monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), the Canadian currency will decline.

###  **15:15 CAD Bank of Canada's press conference**

During the press conference, the head of the Bank of Canada Stephen
Poloz will explain the position of the bank and assess the current
economic situation in the country. If the tone of the speech is tough in
relation to the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the Bank of Canada, the Canadian
dollar will strengthen on the foreign exchange market. If Stephen Poloz
favors a soft monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), the Canadian currency will decline. In
any case, during the speech, high volatility in Canadian dollar quotes
is expected.

###  **Thursday, April 16**

###  **01:30 AUD Employment rate. Unemployment rate**

Employment rates reflect the monthly change in the number of Australian
citizens employed. The growth of the indicator has a positive effect on
consumer spending, which stimulates economic growth. A high value is a
positive factor for the AUD, and a low value is negative. Forecast: in
March, the number of employed Australian citizens fell by 40,000 (after
rising in February by 26,700 and by 13,500 in January).

Also at the same time, the Australian Bureau of Statistics will publish
a report on unemployment - an indicator that estimates the share of the
unemployed to the total number of able-bodied citizens. The growth
indicates a weak labor market, which leads to a weakening of the
national economy. The decline is a positive factor for the AUD.
Forecast: unemployment in Australia in March was at 5.5% (compared with
5.1% in the previous month). In general, the indicators can be described
as negative. However, in other large economies, the labor market has
deteriorated on a large scale too due to the coronavirus.

The RBA leaders have repeatedly stated that in addition to the
international trade situation, the Australian economy and central bank
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) plans are influenced by the level of debts and household
expenses, the growth of workers' salaries, as well as the state of the
country's labor market.

In March 2020, the Republic of Australia lowered its key interest rate
by 0.50% to a new record low of 0.25% due to the coronavirus, which was
the 5th rate cut in the last year. According to the RBA leaders, an
unemployment rate of 4.5% or lower is needed to increase wages and
accelerate inflation to the target range. Unemployment in the country is
not declining, and the return of inflation to the middle of the target
range of 2-3% is not even on a distant horizon.

The AUD is unlikely to respond positively to the publication of data
from the country's labor market. If the values ​​of the indicators turn
out to be worse than the forecast, then the Australian dollar may
decrease significantly in the short term. Data better than forecast will
strengthen the AUD in the short term.

###  **06:00 EUR Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices  (HICP) in Germany
(final release)**

This index is published by the EU Statistical Office and calculated on
the basis of a statistical method agreed upon between all EU countries.
It is an indicator for assessing inflation used by the Governing Council
of the ECB to assess the level of price stability. A positive result
strengthens the EUR, a negative result weakens it.

In January, the HICP index (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) grew by +1.6%, and in
February by +1.7%. The preliminary forecast for March was +1.3%. The
euro is unlikely to react positively to the publication of this
indicator. If the data turn out to be better than the forecast, then the
euro may strengthen in the short term. The growth rate is a positive
factor for the euro. However, this is still not enough to break the
negative trend of the euro. The data still suggests low inflationary
pressures in Germany. Data worse than forecast and the previous value
will negatively affect the euro.

###  **12:30 USD Initial jobless claims in the US over the past week**

The situation on the country's labor market continues to deteriorate
rapidly. A month ago, the indicator of primary claims for unemployment
benefits was within its average values ​​of 193-252 thousand. However,
then the situation began to deteriorate sharply. 3 weeks ago, the
indicator rose to 3,283,000, then to 6,648,000, and last Thursday it
came out with the value of 6,606,000, having shocked the observers and
market participants. According to economists, the American economy will
lose more than 20 million jobs, which was not observed either during the
global financial crisis or during the Great Depression of the 1930s.
Every 1.5 million initial claims increase the unemployment rate by 1
percentage point. This means that two weeks with initial applications of
3 million will raise unemployment to 7.5%.

Economists attribute this to the coronavirus, which has hit the US
economy. Many US companies announced layoffs, and authorities ordered
non-vital companies to close their offices and stores due to the
coronavirus epidemic. Eventually the weekly growth rate of jobless
claims far exceeded the previous record level of 695,000 reached in
October 1982.

This indicator reflects the state of the labor market. An increase in
value negatively affects consumption and economic growth. Under normal
conditions, a high result weakens the US dollar, while a low result
strengthens it. However, in the current environment (the coronavirus
pandemic and a sharp economic slowdown), the reaction of market
participants to the publication of this report by the US Department of
Labor can be completely unpredictable.

###  **02:00 CNY Q1 GDP in China**

The National Bureau of Statistics of China will present data on GDP
growth in the 1st quarter.

In the 2nd quarter, GDP growth amounted to +1.6% (+6.2% in annual
[terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)), in the 3rd and 4th quarters of 2019 +1.5% and +6.0%,
respectively. Chinese GDP is expected to decline in the 1st quarter of
2020 by -10 % (-6.0% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)).

China is the largest buyer of commodities and a supplier to the global
commodity market of finished products of the widest range. China's
economy is the second largest in the world after the American.
Therefore, the publication of important macroeconomic indicators from
China can have a strong impact on the entire financial market.

The relative decline in GDP may negatively affect the yuan quotes, as
well as the prices of commodity currencies and currencies of the Asia-
Pacific region, as may indicate a slowdown in the Chinese economy.

The growth of the indicator will positively affect the Chinese yuan, as
well as world and primarily Asian stock indices and commodity
currencies, such as New Zealand and Australian dollars. China is the
largest trade and economic partner of Australia and New Zealand and a
buyer of commodities from these countries.

Therefore, negative macro statistics from China may also negatively
affect the quotes of these commodity currencies.
