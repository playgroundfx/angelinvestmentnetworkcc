Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 30.06.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

All three cryptocurrency pairs covered in the article must have
completed forming corrective sub-waves, so the prices should start
declining in the bearish impulse waves.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

It is clear from the most recent chart section that the BTCUSD rate is
falling in the bearish wave (5). Wave (5) is unfolding as a regular
impulse 1-2-3-4-5; it is concluding the large impulse [A]. Corrective
wave 4 must have completed as a flat [A]-[B]-[C]. If the assumption is
correct, the Bitcoin price should start declining in the final wave 5 to
a level of 28750.00. This level is marked by wave 3. One could enter
short trades in the current situation.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Sell 35834.00, TP 28750.00

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

The XRPUSD market continues forming a descending zigzag-shaped wave (W),
which is the beginning of the global double or triple zigzag. The hourly
timeframe displays the final impulse wave C which is about to end soon.
The Ripple price should go down to a level of 0.500, following a small
wave 5 which should conclude the entire impulse C. After that, there
will start a new bullish wave. One could enter short positions in the
current situation.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] **** today:

Sell 0.701, TP 0.500

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

The ETHUSD market continues falling. There is unfolding the final part
of the large bearish wave A, sub-wave [5]. The sub-wave [5] is composed
of waves (1)-(2)-(3)-(4)-(5). Corrective wave (4) must have finished as
a double zigzag W-X-Y. The Ethereum price should be declining in the
final wave (5) to a level of 1700.00, marked by the impulse wave (3).
One could enter short positions in the current situation.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Sell 2170.27, TP 1700.00
