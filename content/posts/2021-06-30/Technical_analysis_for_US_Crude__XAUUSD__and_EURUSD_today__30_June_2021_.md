Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 30.06.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

Yesterday, as part of the correctional model, oil prices tested the
resistance Additional Zone 73.13 - 73.00.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

Yesterday, as part of the correctional model, oil prices tested the
resistance Additional Zone 73.13 - 73.00. The price didn’t break out the
zone. A “Pin-bar” sell pattern was also formed. I recommend holding oil
sell trades in correction with a stop beyond yesterday's high.

An alternative scenario implies a breakout of the Additional Zone and
price consolidation above. In this case, the short-term uptrend will
continue, and the target will be level 74.01.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

Hold sell trades entered in Additional Zone 73.13 - 73.00. TakeProfit:
71.80. StopLoss: 73.53.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

Yesterday, a long-awaited pattern to sell in the trend border zone 1794
- 1783 yielded profits. As a result, the June 18 low was updated. Target
Zone 3 1768 - 1763 was also broken out. The next sell target within the
short-term downtrend is the Gold Zone 1745 - 1743.

Yesterday, after the sell pattern was worked out, the price went into
correction, within which the Additional Zone 1763 - 1761 was tested.
This is the first strong resistance at which it is possible to consider
new short trades.

If the Additional Zone is broken out, then the correction will continue
with the target in the Intermediary Zone 1775 - 1773.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

  1. Sell according to the pattern in Additional Zone 1763 - 1761. TakeProfit: 1754, Gold Zone 1745 - 1743. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. Sell according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 1775 - 1773. TakeProfit: 1754, Gold Zone 1745 - 1743. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

Yesterday, the trading idea for selling the euro in correction with the
target at the Intermediary Zone 1.1887 - 1.1878 fully worked out.

As the short-term euro uptrend continues, it is profitable to look for
purchases with the target at level 1.1968. To enter purchases a pattern
is required, for example, a “1-2-3” in the Intermediary Zone.

The short-term trend will reverse down in case of the Intermediary Zone
breakout and price consolidation below.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

Buy according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 1.1887 - 1.1878.
TakeProfit: 1.1968. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.
