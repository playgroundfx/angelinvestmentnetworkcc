Forex in July: markets will be hot! Forecast for EURUSD, GBPUSD, USDJPY,
AUDNZD, GBPNOK and GBPSEK as of 30.06...Dmitri Demidenko

Someone goes on vacation in the middle of summer, while others, on the
contrary, anticipate serious movements amid a busy economic and
political [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) and a decrease in liquidity. Let's discuss the market
outlook and make up a trading plan for [EURUSD][1], [GBPUSD][2],
[USDJPY][3], [AUDNZD][4], [GBPNOK][5], and [GBPSEK][6]

## Monthly G10 currencies fundamental forecast

The OPEC summit, the US employment data, the discussion of Joe Biden's
new fiscal stimulus by the US Congress, talks about inflation, as well
as the ECB and Fed meetings will affect financial markets in July. Given
the traditional liquidity squeeze due to the holiday season, mid-summer
is going to be very hot. Can the seasonal factor help in the formation
of investment strategies?

The Swedish and Norwegian krone are among the G10 leaders in July. From
1975 to 2020, these two currencies strengthened against the US dollar in
26 and 25 out of 46 cases, respectively. In contrast, the Canadian and
Australian dollars, as well as the British pound in mid-summer, are
among the outsiders. Given the market's focus on monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), the
loonie and sterling's weak positions look surprising. However, they will
not be unprofitable in July, even taking into account the statistics.

Based on such a parameter as the median, Scandinavian currencies are
among the favorites. At the same time, the averages warn that trading
the British pound, the Swiss franc, and the New Zealand dollar in the
middle of summer can be very risky.

This assumption is supported by G10 currencies' dynamics in favorable or
unfavorable periods. At the time of closures in the green zone, the
Swiss franc added 3% on average, the sterling and the euro added 2.6%
each. On the contrary, trading the Canadian dollar in July can be
boring.

### Price dynamics during rise-fall periods

In my opinion, one should not get carried away with selling the loonie,
which is supported by strong oil and the Bank of Canada. The BoC, in
turn, is ready to normalize monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) before the Fed. Even if
OPEC+ increases production more than expected at the July 1 summit, this
will perceive [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s that the organization is confident about the oil
market's bright future. But the emphasis of the central banks of Norway
and Sweden on the withdrawal of monetary stimulus may serve as the
reason for the [GBPNOK][5] and [GBPSEK][6] sales.

The AUD's position is insecure due to lockdowns and tensions with China.
Moreover, the RBA, worried about low inflation, is not going to
normalize monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). On the contrary, the New Zealand central bank
may improve its position due to fears about the overheating of the real
estate market in the country. These factors make it possible to sell
[AUDNZD][4].

In case of publication of strong US employment data and further
inflation acceleration, hawkish sentiments at the FOMC meeting on July
27-28 are likely to intensify, which will have a positive effect on the
US dollar. The rise in the yield on 10-year Treasury bonds is a reason
to buy [USDJPY][3]. Christine Lagarde's dovish statements at a press
conference after the ECB meeting on July 21-22 are a signal to sell
[EURUSD][1]. [GBPUSD][2] short trades will become relevant if the Brexit
issue returns to the markets.
