Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 22.07.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

The cryptocurrency pairs covered in the article should be rising, it is
relevant to enter long trades.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

The BTCUSD continues forming a global simple zigzag, with the corrective
wave [B] developing inside as a double zigzag (W)-(X)-(Y). The bearish
wave (X) must have completed as a triple zigzag. Therefore, the price
should be rising in the final motive wave (Y) to a level above 34700.00.
Sub-wave X finished at this level earlier. One could enter buy trades in
the current situation.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 31970.50, TP 34700.00

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

The XRPUSD market is forming a new upwave as a double zigzag W-X-Y. Sub-
wave W completed as a simple zigzag [A]-[B]-[C]. The linking down wave X
ended as a triple zigzag [W]-[X]-[Y]-[X]-[Z]. The Ripple price should be
rising in the final motive wave Y to a level above 0.655, marked by the
linking wave [X]. One could enter purchases in the current situation.

The ETHUSD market continues forming a simple descending zigzag, with the
bearish impulse wave A completed inside. There is now developing the B
correction as a standard zigzag. There has completed the middle leg of
the zigzag, the corrective wave [B]. Wave [B] is a triple zigzag. The
price should be rising in the [C] impulse over the next few days to a
level above the previous high, where the linking wave (X) finished. One
could enter long trades in the current situation.
