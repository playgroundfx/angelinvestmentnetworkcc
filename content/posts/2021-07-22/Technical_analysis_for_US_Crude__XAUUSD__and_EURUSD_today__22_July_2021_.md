Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 22.07.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

The euro is correcting to a short-term downtrend, the border of which is
at level 1.1812.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

Yesterday, the short-term oil trend reversed up. The Intermediary Zone
67.89 - 67.62 was broken out and then the price reached the Target Zone
70.80 - 70.27. Further growth will depend on the buyers' ability to
break out the Target Zone and consolidate the price higher at the US
trading session.

If the Target Zone is broken out, then the next buy target will be the
Gold Zone 73.19 - 72.92. Until that happens, consider purchases with a
limited target in the ​​yesterday high's zone. It is profitable to look
for purchases at strong supports: Additional Zone 69.03 - 68.90 and
Intermediary Zone 67.71 - 67.44.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

Buy according to the pattern in Additional Zone 69.03 - 68.90.
TakeProfit: 70.27. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

Yesterday, gold traders partially worked out the Intermediary Zone 1819
- 1817 and updated the July 19 low. The main goal is to test the Target
Zone 1789 - 1784. However, in order for the price to fall further, the
bears need to break out the support level of 1800. Until it is broken
out, the correction continues, the target of which is the Additional
Zone 1807 - 1805.

After the Additional Zone test, look for new sales to update yesterday's
low and reach the Target Zone. If the Additional Zone is broken out
upside with price consolidation, then it will be possible to enter
purchases with a target in the zone of ​​1824 - 1817.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

  1. Sell according to the pattern in Additional Zone 1807 - 1805. TakeProfit: 1795. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. Buy when the Additional Zone 1807 - 1805 is broken out. TakeProfit: 1820. StopLoss: 1802.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

The euro is correcting to a short-term downtrend, the border of which is
at level 1.1812. Now traders are testing the Additional Zone 1.1800 -
1.1796. The price has not yet broken out the zone.

Today look for a pattern to enter sales in the Additional Zone and sell
the euro according to the pattern to update yesterday's low.

If the market does not provide a sell pattern but instead breaks out the
Additional Zone, then buy the euro with a target at level 1.1821 and a
stop beyond the day's low.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

  1. Sell according to the pattern in Additional Zone 1.1800 - 1.1796. TakeProfit: 1.1754. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.
