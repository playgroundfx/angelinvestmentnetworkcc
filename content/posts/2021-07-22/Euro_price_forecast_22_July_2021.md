Euro doesn’t fear. Forecast as of 22.07.2021Dmitri Demidenko

If Christine Lagarde stresses the differences in the US and euro-area
economic growth and the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the Fed and the ECB, the
[EURUSD][1] bulls will be discouraged. Let us discuss the Forex outlook
and make up a trading plan.

## Weekly euro fundamental forecast

Since Monday, the [EURUSD][2] bulls have been afraid of the dovish tone
of the ECB officials at the meeting on July 22. However, they are tired
of fears and go ahead. The euro has soared amid an increase in the
global risk appetite. Will the growth continue?

Over the past decade, the euro-area economy has faced persistently low
inflation that does not meet the targets of the ECB. In other words,
output and employment were lower than they needed to meet the European
Central Bank's criteria for price stability. As a result, Christine
Lagarde inherited higher debt and lower inflation expectations. The ECB
will spare no effort to support the inflation growth.

In this respect, the forecast of PGIM Fixed Income of an increase in the
earlier quantitative easing program (APP) after the completion of PEPP
from €20 billion to €80 billion per month does not look fantastic. It is
about ECB’s additional asset purchases for €720 billion for the year
until March 2023, which is equivalent to a third of the bonds purchased
by the European Central Bank since 2014. Given the ECB's forecast of
1.4% inflation in 2023, the regulator has to do much work to bring the
indicator up to a target of 2%. And Christine Lagarde is willing to
start right away.

### Dynamics of eurozone inflation and ECB forecasts

Christine Lagarde should again speak about the difference in the US and
euro-area economic growth at the press conference following the
Governing Council’s meeting. According to Oxford Economics, the delta
variant of COVID-19 will threaten the United States if it becomes
uncontrollable, which is unlikely. Against the background of successful
vaccinations, consumers savings, and the willingness of Americans to
spend money, the United States is not going to introduce new
restrictions. Unlike European countries. By highlighting the divergence
in GDP growth, the ECB president will set the [EURUSD][2] bulls back.

The same goes for monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). The current inflation and the ECB
forecasts give no reasons to tighten monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). The Fed’s
officials, however, talk about tapering the QE and could raise the
interest rates in 2022. In theory, this should support the Treasury
yield growth, widening the gap between the US and the euro-area bond
yields and pressing the euro down against the greenback. Nonetheless,
the Treasury yields do not grow, which could result from [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s’
concerns about a downturn in the global economy. Again, it is a reason
to buy the dollar as a safe-haven asset.

### Weekly [EURUSD][2] trading plan

The divergence in the GDP growth and monetary policies, as well as high
demand for safe-havens, suggests selling the [EURUSD][2] on the rise,
followed by the rebound from the resistance levels of 1.1825, 1.187, and
1.192. It will also be relevant to sell the euro if the price doesn’t
consolidate above $1.177.
