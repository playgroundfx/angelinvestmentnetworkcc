Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 31.08.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

The BTCUSD market seems to be forming the final leg of the impulse as an
ending diagonal.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

The BTCUSD market is forming the final impulse wave (C) of the ascending
zigzag-shaped correction [B]. The final, fifth, wave of the (C) impulse
seems to be unfolding as an ending diagonal [1]-[2]-[3]-[4]-[5]. Wave
[4] has finished further than wave [1]. The Bitcoin price could be
rising in the final wave [5] to a level of 51100.00. One could enter
purchases in the current situation.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 47125.50, TP 51100.00

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

The most recent section of the XRPUSD chart displays the final leg of
the impulse up wave C. In the C wave, the bearish correction [4] must
have completed as a simple zigzag composed of sub-waves (A)-(B)-(C). The
Ripple price should be rising in sub-wave [5] to a level of 1.402. One
could open buy positions in the current situation.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] **** today:

Buy 1.123, TP 1.402

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

The ETHUSD market is forming the impulse up wave [C] composed of sub-
waves (2)-(3)-(4)-(5). Corrective wave (4) has completed as a flat
A-B-C. There is developing the final wave (5), which will finish when
sub-waves 3-4-5 complete. An approximate trajectory of Ethereum future
price movement is outlined in the chart. The price should go up to a
level of 3670.00. It is relevant to buy under the current conditions.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Buy 3237.81, TP 3670.00
