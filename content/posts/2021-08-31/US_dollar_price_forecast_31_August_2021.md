Forex in September: will [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s switch to euro?Dmitri Demidenko

The upcoming release of the US jobs report, ECB and Fed meetings, US
Congressional discussions on new fiscal stimulus and public debt
ceiling, parliamentary elections in Germany and OPEC+ meeting. September
will be hot! Let's discuss the market outlook and make up a trading plan
for [EURUSD][1], [GBPUSD][2], [AUDUSD][3], [USDCHF][4], [EURCHF][5],
[USDNOK][6] and [USDSEK][7].

## Monthly G10 currencies fundamental forecast

For several months in a row, the statistics contradict the fundamentals.
Does this mean that trends will begin to break soon? Are there no
seasonal patterns in the movement of currency pairs on Forex? I believe
that it is unnecessary to make decisions on the conclusion of
transactions only based on statistics. It is necessary to take into
account other conditions. For example, the lack of the [S&P 500][8]
correction saved us from buying the yen against major currencies in
August. What awaits the markets in September?

European currencies most often became the leaders in September. From
1975 to 2020, the Norwegian krone, the Swedish krona and the Swiss franc
strengthened against the US dollar on 28 out of 46 occasions. The euro
and the British pound positions were confident as well. Among the
outsiders are commodity currencies: Australian, Canadian and New Zealand
dollars. Does the seasonal factor signal that the turbulence in the oil-
dominated commodity markets will continue? This is not good [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) for
risky assets.

### Rise-fall periods

Curiously, but judging by the averages and medians, the Swiss franc and
the Japanese yen paths may diverge in September. The parliamentary
elections in Germany can ensure the growth of demand for the franc. The
long-term dominance of Angela Merkel's party is likely to end, and an
increase in the degree of political risks will contribute to the growth
of interest in the European safe-haven currency, the CHF.

### Averages and medians

The main events of September will be the OPEC+ meeting, the release of
the US jobs report, ECB and Fed meetings, US Congressional discussions
on new fiscal stimulus and public debt ceiling, and the parliamentary
elections in Germany. Investors will monitor the epidemiological
situation and the slowdown in the Chinese economy. Judging by the
statistics, Beijing will not be able to solve problems just like that.
The Australian and New Zealand dollars fell the most among the G10
currencies in September in the worst periods. The fastest-growing were
the CHF, the NOK, and the SEK.

### Price dynamics during rise-fall periods

In my opinion, the release of the US jobs report will serve as a
defining event for financial markets. Weak statistics are likely to
cause the major world currencies to strengthen against the US dollar.
European currencies, led by the euro, receive an additional boost on
expectations of the ECB improved forecasts on inflation and GDP at the
meeting of the Governing Council on September 9. In this case, buy
[EURUSD][1] and sell [USDCHF][4], [USDNOK][6] and [USDSEK][7].

On the contrary, impressive numbers for non-farm payrolls will bring
back [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) interest in the USD. Its share in portfolios is likely to
grow until the FOMC meeting on September 21-22. In this case, it will be
relevant to sell [AUDUSD][3], [EURUSD][1] and [GBPUSD][2].

US stock indices' correction may support the US dollar due to
disappointment over the inability of Congress to support Joe Biden's
initiatives. As the German parliamentary elections approach, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s
will sell [EURCHF][5].
