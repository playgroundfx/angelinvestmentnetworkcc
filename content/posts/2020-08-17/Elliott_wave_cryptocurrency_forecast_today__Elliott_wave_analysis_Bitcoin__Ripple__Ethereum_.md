The corrective wave (4) is likely to have finished. It is composed of
three sub-waves W-X-Y, where sub-waves W and Y are simple zigzags, and
the linking wave X is a bullish triple zigzag. There is now forming the
upward impulse wave (5), which is a simple impulse. The market should be
rising in the final phases of the bullish trend to a level of 12600.

The XRPUSD market is likely to have finished the corrective wave 4 that
is a part of the bullish impulse (C). It is composed of the three major
sub-waves [w]-[x]-[y]. After the correction 4 completed, there has
started developing impulse wave 5. The first four elements are likely to
have completed. Therefore, the market should be rising in the sub-waves
[5] of 5 towards a level of 0.330. We shall continue monitoring the
market situation.

The chart displays the structure of the final wave [5] that is unfolding
as a bullish impulse. The first four sub-waves of this impulse,
(1)-(2)-(3)-(4), have completed. There is now forming the final, fifth
waves in the upward impulse wave (5). Presumably, the market should soon
reach level 500.00, where the entire uptrend should finish. Next, the
market should turn down and start declining.
