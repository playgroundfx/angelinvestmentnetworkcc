Aussie passes a hurdle. Forecast as of 10.02.2021Dmitri Demidenko

If it weren't for the Australian QE and [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/)ly low RBA rates, the
Australian dollar would be significantly higher than current levels due
to rising commodity prices. Let us discuss the Forex outlook and make up
a trading plan.

## Fundamental Australian Dollar forecast for six months

Fiscal stimulus is fueling consumer demand, including demand for
commodities. Hopes for commodity demand to recover to pre-crisis levels
are pushing up prices of its market assets and currencies. They appear
as the main favorites on Forex. The only thing that can hold them back
is central banks' monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), but this is a temporary measure. The
Australian dollar serves as a typical example.

The RBA's decision to add another AU$100 billion to the QE program came
as a complete surprise to the market. Investors hoped that the regulator
would signal QE's curtailment amid victory over the pandemic, the
opening of the economy, and an improvement in the labor market
conditions. Only Philip Lowe's speech, the Governor of the Reserve Bank
of Australia, clarified the situation. If not for monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), the
Aussie rate would have been significantly higher. In Lowe's opinion, it
is determined by the commodity market and the activities of central
banks-competitors. At the same time, the growth of [AUDUSD][1] by a
third of the March bottom levels slows down inflation. According to RBA
forecasts, CPI will not return to the target range of 2-3% on a
sustainable basis until 2023, which allows the regulator to talk about
the need to keep the cash rate at the current level of 0.1%, at least
until 2024.

Thus, the de jure expansion of the Australian QE is an attempt to reduce
the debt market rates and accelerate inflation. De facto, it is nothing
more than a barrier on the way of the [AUDUSD][1] bulls. It seems that
Philip Lowe is a bit disingenuous. Australia's inflation is not as
hopeless as he tries to present . The deferred demand and rising prices
for raw materials, including those for energy, will surely drive up the
CPI in the next couple of quarters. Curtailing the RBA's QE program is a
matter of time, and what the central bank did in February was nothing
more than a currency war.

In my opinion, the [AUDUSD][1] rally will continue, which will be
significantly facilitated by the reset of US-China relations. At first
glance, Donald Trump's aggressive [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) has paid off: in 2020, the US-
China foreign trade deficit amounted to $310.8 billion, which is $36
billion less than in 2016, when Trump won the election. At the same
time, during his time in power, the aggregate negative balance of trade
in goods and services increased by 41%.

The main reason for the negative dynamics of the indicator is the
slowdown in international trade. So it is not surprising that Joe Biden
intends to reconsider relations with China. Hope for a thaw is fueling
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) demand for the yuan and the closely related Australian dollar.

### [AUDUSD][1] trading plan for six months

Thus, no matter how hard the Reserve Bank of Australia tries to restrain
its currency exchange rate, it only allows traders to buy "Aussie"
cheaper, which we have done. My trading idea to buy the [AUDUSD][1] on
the price decline towards [0.763 and 0.759][2] was correct. Now it
remains to go with the flow in the direction of the 0.79 and 0.82
targets, periodically increase longs on pullbacks and watch as the
deposit increases.
