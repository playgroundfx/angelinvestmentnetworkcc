Euro and Draghi effect. Forecast as of 10.02.2021Dmitri Demidenko

Mario Draghi used to rein the euro by just a single word. The former ECB
president now faces a different challenge, but [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s remember his
financial markets' impact, so the [EURUSD][1] is growing. Let us discuss
the Forex outlook and make up a trading plan.

## Weekly euro fundamental forecast

Financial markets trade reflation and enjoy the process. The [S&P
500][2] has broken through the all-time highs eight times in 2021 amid
the trust in vaccines and fiscal stimulus provided by Joe Biden, as well
as strong corporate reporting. According to FactSet, out of the 295
reported companies included in the stock index calculation base, 81%
exceeded analysts' expectations for earnings growth. In January, the US
stock market and [EURUSD][1] were trading in the opposite directions due
to concerns about too slow vaccination progress in Europe. In February,
the [S&P 500][2], as in the good old days, again supports the euro
bulls.

According to Citi, when the stock index reaches level 4000, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s
could start exiting longs, triggering a drawdown. Nonetheless, the US
stock market is exposed to a risk of short squeezing, the short-sellers’
positions of $21 billion are losing, and their closures will encourage
bulls.

Besides, the US stock market rally and the associated increase in the
risk appetite are not the only drivers of the [EURUSD][1] growth. Amid a
decrease in the COVID-19 cases as the seasonal peak is over, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s
accepted that the vaccination progresses slower in Europe than in the
USA. After all, the economies will be reopened when the coronavirus is
defeated, which is now happening without vaccines. The Mario Draghi
factor also strengthens the euro.

The importance of personality in [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) is difficult to overestimate.
Financial markets welcomed Draghi’s return to big politics. Italy’s
benchmark 10-year bond yield slipped below 0.5 % for the first time.
Spain raised €5 billion in debt sale at a coupon of 1.45 %. This was the
country’s first 50-year deal since 2016 when buyers demanded a much
higher borrowing cost of 3.45 %. Buyers are exited amid a slowdown of
the ECB’s asset purchases monthly pace to €15 billion, which suggests
the Draghi effect. A super-Mario-led government pursuing pro-European
reforms could increase the prospects for complex changes to EU fiscal
rules, which in turn will boost Italy's economic growth.

Furthermore, the euro’s correction down lowered the risks of the ECB’s
verbal interventions. The trade-weighted euro rolled down even deeper
than the [EURUSD][1].

Therefore, the [S&P 500][2] rally, a seasonal decline in the number of
COVID-19 cases, and the Draghi effect encourage the euro bulls to go
ahead. Investors ignore the factor of the slow vaccination process in
the EU, where 4% of the population were inoculated, compared to the US
(13.5%). Markets hope for the explosive growth of the global economy.

### Weekly [EURUSD][1] trading plan

The [EURUSD][1] broke out the resistance level at 1.208 and reached the
first target, indicated in the [previous analytics][3], at 1.2125. The
next upside targets are at 1.215, 1.221 and 1.225. If the [S&P 500][2]
continues growing in price, the euro bulls will achieve the indicated
targets within a few days. It is still relevant to enter longs.
