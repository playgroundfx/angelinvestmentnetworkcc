Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 10.02.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

The XRPUSD market should be forming a bearish zigzag. When the bullish
corrective wave finishes, the price should be declining in a bearish
impulse.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

The BTCUSD price chart displays the upward impulse wave structure, with
the corrective wave 4 completed as a triple zigzag inside. Next, the
price has started rising in the bullish impulse [1]-[2]-[3]-[4]-[5]. At
the time of writing, there is forming the impulse wave [3], namely, its
final leg. A short corrective wave 4 should soon end, and the price will
continue rising in wave 5 to a level of 49600.00, as it is outlined in
the chart.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 45986.00 TP 49600.00

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

The XRPUSD market completed the upward linking wave (X), which is
composed of the three major sub-waves A-B-C. After wave (X) finished,
the market has started declining. There must be forming the bearish wave
W as a simple zigzag. After the impulse wave [A] ended, there has
started developing the [B] correction as a triple zigzag. This triple
zigzag should soon complete at a level of 0.525. Next, the price will
start declining again in the impulse wave [C].

### Trading plan for **[XRPUSD][2]** today:

Buy 0.481, TP 0.525

## Elliott wave Ethereum analysis

The ETHUSD market continues forming the upward impulse wave C. The C
wave should end soon. In the fifth wave of the C wave, there is
developing the final impulse 5 that is composed of five sub-waves
[i]-[ii]-[iii]-[iv]-[v], where the first four sub-waves have completed,
and the final sub-wave [v] is still unfolding. Shortly, wave (5) of a
smaller degree should conclude wave [v] at a level of around 1945.00.
Next, the market should start a new bearish trend.

### Trading plan for  **[ETHUSD][3] **today:

Buy 1781.01, TP 1945.00
