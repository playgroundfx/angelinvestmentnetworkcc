Platinum Price Forecast: 2021 and BeyondJana Kane

In this article, we examine whether platinum could be an interesting
investment for the coming years. We will discuss the price development
of recent years; then, we will look at the current price. We’ll discuss
the applications of platinum, the platinum price forecast, and the
causes of the price drop. Finally, we will look at the opportunities of
investing in the precious metal PL. What is the future of platinum
prices? Read on to find out.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Platinum: A Recent History

Platinum [began][1] 2020 at $985 an ounce and ended the year at slightly
above $1,000 an ounce. Over the past year, the security asset price
declined in March to a record low of $606, along with a massive sell-off
of assets and other precious metals amid the pandemic, and then
gradually reached its range of $950-1,000 per ounce. Despite the
volatility, platinum stabilized, and [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s perceived the
depreciation as a buying opportunity.

[Platinum][2] is a relatively cheap, [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/)ly undervalued precious
metal, which attracted the attention of [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s in 2020. The volume of
shares in platinum exchange-traded funds reached a record 3.8 million
ounces in August, having increased by 543,000 ounces, which is an all-
time high. Net purchases of platinum bars in Japan exceeded 200,000
ounces in the first half of 2020, the highest since the first half of
2016.

In the first half of 2020, demand for platinum increased sharply on the
Shanghai Gold Exchange (SGE). At the same time, the demand for jewelry
grew slightly. As a result, demand decreased in the second half of the
year. However, the large lag of platinum from gold and new jewelry
designs have partially restored interest in white metal.

After Joe Biden’s victory in the presidential election, the following
may happen: platinum will become more expensive than gold. The fact is
that the United States and other leading countries are switching to
green energy while reducing the consumption of fossil fuels. Hydrogen is
a key element of green energy.

Platinum will play a critical role in the hydrogen economy. This
precious metal is essential for fuel cells and the production of
hydrogen through the electrolysis of water. A major platinum rally is
expected in 2021 due to reduced supply, as well as increased demand due
to the increasing popularity of hydrogen as an energy source.

## Platinum Price Today

Today, platinum is traded at $1 214.00. You can refer to this article to

[platinum rate][2] for buying and selling:

## Platinum Price Predictions by Experts

Let’s see what industry experts have to say about the price of platinum:

1\. Investinghaven

According to their platinum forecast, we should expect a bullish
breakout in 2021. The market price ultimately has an upside PL potential
of 80% ($1800/oz) in 2022 or beyond. In 2021 we see price targets of
$1,350 and $1,500. The prerequisite was that platinum would break above
$1045/oz, which it did. The Investinghaven 2021 forecast for platinum is
[wildly bullish][3].

2\. Wallet[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)

If you are looking for commodities with good returns, platinum can be a
profitable investment option, [according to Wallet[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)][4] analysts.
Based on their platinum forecast, a long-term increase is expected; the
expected platinum rate for Mar 6, 2026, is 1,379.590 USD per ounce. With
a 5-year investment, the revenue is expected to be around +14%.

3\. Neal Froneman

Neal Froneman, the CEO of the world’s No. 1 platinum mining company
[Sibanye Stillwater Ltd][5], said the [price of the white metal][2]
could climb more than 80% over the next four to five years as the world
economy recovers and supply drops. “Platinum has only just started to
recover, and it will continue,” Froneman said. He also added that “There
is no reason why platinum will not eventually trade at $2,000 an ounce
and probably even higher.”

## Platinum Long-Term Technical Analysis

Platinum has broken through the ceiling of a falling trend channel in
the long term. This indicates a slower falling rate initially or the
start of a more horizontal development. The PL future has broken up
through the resistance at 1180. This predicts a further rise. The future
predictions are assessed as technically positive for the long term.

## How Much Has the Price of Platinum Change Over Time?

Is the platinum price expected to rise? We can’t predict with certainty
what the price of platinum will be in the next 10 years, but we can look
back at the price [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/). This can help us make more reliable
predictions. Below is a [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) price chart that shows how the price
of platinum changed over the past 10 years:

## Factors that Affect the Platinum Price

Platinum is a precious metal that is rarer than gold. The metal cannot
be found in many places in the world. It is mainly mined in South
Africa. Furthermore, the precious metal can be found in Russia and
Canada. Unlike gold, platinum is also widely used industrially. More
than 50% of the demand comes from the industry. The greatest demand
comes from the automotive sector. The metal is widely used for
catalysts. In addition, it is used for various other industrial
applications. This includes electronics, paint, and petroleum.

 **The following factors can affect the price of platinum:**

### 1\. Diesel Scandal

Platinum is widely used for catalytic converters in the automotive
sector. The use of this precious metal helps to reduce harmful exhaust
gases. The diesel scandal in the automotive sector has had a negative
impact on the demand for diesel cars. As a result, the demand for
platinum has also decreased.

### 2\. Trade Wars

As we stated earlier, platinum is also used industrially. As a result,
trade disputes have had a negative impact on the demand and, therefore,
the price of the platinum projections.

### 3\. Hydrogen

Will we all drive electric cars in the future? Or are we switching en
masse to hydrogen? Car manufacturers such as Volkswagen and Audi are
investing heavily in driving on hydrogen. A relatively large amount of
platinum is required for the catalysts in fuel cells. Increasing
investments in hydrogen will therefore lead to a significantly higher
demand for this precious metal.

### 4\. South Africa issues

About 70% of the platinum mines in South Africa are currently loss-
making. These mines are only in production because of the low employment
in the country. This is because closing will lead to even fewer jobs.
However, keeping these mines open at current platinum prices seems an
untenable situation. Strikes and the closure of these mines will lead to
a significantly lower supply of this precious metal. This will have a
positive effect on the projected value of platinum.

### 5\. Scarcity

Platinum is a rarer precious metal than gold. It can be assumed that
precious metal prices will continue to rise in the long run. After all,
there are exhaustible resources. Since platinum is rarer than gold, the
negative platinum-gold ratio could very well be only temporary.

## What Is the Future of Platinum? Is Platinum a Good Investment?

Given the current price and opportunities, investing in [platinum][2]
can be a great way to diversify the portfolio. The price is volatile
because it has many industrial applications.

Platinum is very attractive at the moment. In recent years, this
precious metal has become increasingly cheaper compared to other
precious metals. The precious metal is not only used for catalytic
converters in cars; it is also used in jewelry and bought as an
investment object. The platinum price estimation for 2021 is as follows:

Once the corona crisis is over, platinum could catch up. As the global
economy recovers from the corona crisis, the demand for cars will
increase further. Platinum will benefit from this because the use of
this precious metal in catalytic converters helps to reduce the emission
of harmful exhaust gases. Hydrogen cars contain even more platinum,
which means that the car industry will also need platinum in the future.

With a recovery in the economy, the demand for platinum jewelry will
also pick up. China, the largest platinum market for jewelry, the
platinum projected growth has a lot of potential in the coming years.
Finally, more [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s will also start to consider platinum, now that
the precious metal has become so cheap relative to gold. Make sure to
