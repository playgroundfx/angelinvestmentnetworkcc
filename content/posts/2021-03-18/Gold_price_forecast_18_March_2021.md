Gold acts too impulsive. Forecast as of 18.03.2021Dmitri Demidenko

It would seem that the strong dollar and growing US Treasury yields
should have forced the [XAUUSD][1] bulls to give in, but they continue
to resist. The question arises, for how long? Let us discuss the Forex
outlook and make up a gold trading plan.

## Fundamental gold forecast for a week

Looking at how strong gold was ahead of the FOMC meeting against the
backdrop of growing US Treasury yields and the US dollar's
strengthening, I caught myself thinking that the precious metal was
waiting for the Fed's verdict. As a result, the gold price soared to a
2-week high, but the [EURUSD][2] bulls' inability to break out the
resistance at level 1.199 drove the gold price down. Perhaps the central
bank would like the greenback to be weaker than it is now, but without
the recovery of the economies competing with the US, this will be
extremely difficult to implement.

The Fed has both good and bad [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) for gold. The regulator expects
inflation to accelerate to 2.2% in 2021, followed by a slowdown to 2% in
2022 and 2.1% in 2023, and, most importantly, is ready to tolerate
consumer prices' rise. Jerome Powell considers the current monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) parameters are fair, and most FOMC members do not plan to raise
rates until 2024. The precious metal is traditionally perceived as a
hedge against inflationary risks. In turn, accommodative monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
tends to create a tailwind for gold, contributing to the dollar
weakening and low debt market rates. This time it's not like that.

The Fed's move to target average inflation and get rid of incentives
ahead of time makes financial markets doubt Powell's words. As a result,
US Treasury yields are rising, while gold [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/)s holdings are rapidly
decreasing, having dropped by 150 tons since the beginning of the year.

US debt market rates will continue to rise. These are the outcomes of a
situation where the economy is ready to accelerate to 6.5% in 2021 and
where the population has about $1.7 trillion in excess savings,
according to Bloomberg estimates, excluding Joe Biden's fiscal stimulus.
Expectations of faster US GDP growth compared to competitors tend to
strengthen the greenback.

US and other G10 countries

Perhaps the Fed would like the USD index to be weaker than it is now,
but without acceleration of the EU vaccination campaign and the
associated improvement in eurozone business activity, the [EURUSD][2]
price at best will begin to consolidate, and at worst will continue to
fall. The euro share in the USD index structure is 57%, so the European
currency is an important driver of gold market changes. It is likely
that in the third quarter, or perhaps a little earlier, a lot will
change, but so far, the [XAUUSD][1] bulls' attacks look too impulsive.
As a rule, such behavior leads to a loss of money.

### Weekly gold trading plan

In my opinion, the strong USD and growing US Treasury yields create
preconditions for gold sales on the rise to $1755 and $1775, or on the
breakout of supports at $1730 and $1710 per ounce. The targets for the
downward movement are $1675 and $1640.
