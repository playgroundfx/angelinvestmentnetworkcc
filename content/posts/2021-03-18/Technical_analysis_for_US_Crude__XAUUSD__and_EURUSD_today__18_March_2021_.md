Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 18.03.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

Gold bulls have taken full control of the situation. After the [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) from
the Fed, the Intermediary Zone 1731 - 1726 was broken out.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

On Monday, March 15, traders defined the trading channel to open
positions within which trading is carried out. Monday candle range:
66.42 - 64.18. On Tuesday, Wednesday and today, sellers are trying to
break out the support 64.18. So far, this has not led to any result.
Buyers are struggling to hold the border of the short-term uptrend.

As long as the short-term trend remains up, look for oil purchases with
the target at Monday high.

The closing of the US trading session below the Intermediary Zone 64.16
- 63.93 is required for oil sales. In this case, it will be possible to
open a short trade with the target in the Target Zone 61.90 - 61.44.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

Buy according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 64.16 - 63.93.
TakeProfit: 66.33. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

Gold bulls have taken full control of the situation. After the Fed's
[news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/), the Intermediary Zone 1731 - 1726 and the resistance level of 1738
were broken out. The short-term trend reversed up. The target for
purchases for the week is the Target Zone 1786 - 1776.

It is profitable to look for gold purchases on correction at strong
support levels. The closest level is the zone between the margin zone
1743 and the level of 1738. The second zone for searching for purchases
is the Additional Zone 1730 - 1728. Wait for a correction and look for a
pattern.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

  1. Open buy positions according to the pattern in 1743 - 1738. TakeProfit: 1755, Target Zone 1786 - 1776. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. Open buy positions according to the pattern in 1730 - 1723. TakeProfit: 1755, Target Zone 1786 - 1776. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

The euro follows the priority bullish pattern, approaching the Target
Zone 1.2011 - 1.1995. After reaching the Target Zone, watch if traders
manage to break out the resistance and close the price above the level
of 1.2011 at the US trading session. In case of a positive result, the
next growth target will be the Gold Zone 1.2083 - 1.2075.

For today, it would be reasonable to hold up purchases, according to
yesterday's recommendation, with the target at level 1.1990. It is
profitable to enter new long trades on correction at strong support
levels. Don't consider sales.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

Hold up purchases entered in the zone of 1.1917 - 1.1892. TakeProfit:
1.1990. StopLoss: at the breakeven.
