Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 18.03.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

The Ethereum seems to be forming a deeper correction than it was
expected in previous forecasts; this correction is about to finish now.
Next, the ETHUSD market will be forming the final impulse.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

The most recent chart section displays the structure of the upward
impulse wave [3]. Within this wave, there has recently completed the
bearish corrective wave (4) a standard zigzag. Next, the market has
completed forming two small sub-waves 1 and 2 of the bullish impulse
wave (5). The market is now rising in wave 3, which could end at a level
of around 66300.00. Next, the price will slightly decline in correction
4, as it is outlined in the chart.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 58877.50, TP 66300.00

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

There is forming a simple down zigzag [A]-[B]-[C], with the impulse wave
[A] and corrective wave [B] completed inside. Correction [B] has a
complex structure of a triple zigzag (W)-(X)-(Y)-(X)-(Z). After the
indicated formation completed, the market has formed two small sub-waves
(1) and (2), which are the elements of the bearish impulse wave [C]. If
the assumption is correct, and the correction (2) has completed its
pattern, the price should be declining in impulse (3). The first target
to enter sell trades is the low at 0.424, marked by wave (XX).

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] today:

Sell 0.471, TP 0.424

## Elliott wave Ethereum analysis

Ethereum continues forming a large upward impulse C, with the final,
fifth, leg unfolding inside. In wave [5], there is forming the sub-wave
(5), which also has an impulse structure. Most likely, there is
unfolding the bearish correction 4 as a simple zigzag. Impulse [a] and
correction [b] have completed. The price should be declining in the
final bearish impulse [c] towards a level of 1705.00. Next, the market
could turn up and start rising. Under the current conditions, one could
enter sell trades.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Sell 1829.35, TP 1705.00
