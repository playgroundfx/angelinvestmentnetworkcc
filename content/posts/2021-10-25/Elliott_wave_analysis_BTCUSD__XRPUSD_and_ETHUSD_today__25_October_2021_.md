Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 25.10.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

Bitcoin and Ethereum should continue forming corrective waves over the
next few days.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

The BTCUSD market must continue forming corrective wave [B], composed of
sub-waves (A)-(B)-(C), with the final leg (C) unfolding. There should be
developing corrective wave 4 as a zigzag [A]-[B]-[C]. The Bitcoin price
should be rising in the [B] wave to a level of 63800.00, marked by
corrective wave (4).

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 61977.50, TP 63800.00

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

The XRPUSD market continues forming the linking upwave X, which is an
element of a large double zigzag. Wave X is unfolding as a triple zigzag
[W]-[X]-[Y]-[X]-[Z]. The second linking wave [X] should soon complete as
a double zigzag. Next, the final motive wave [Z] will start unfolding as
a zigzag, as outlined in the chart. The impulse wave (A) should end at a
level around 1.152.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] **** today:

Buy 1.090, TP 1.152

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

The ETHUSD market continues forming corrective wave B composed of sub-
waves [A]-[B]-[C]. Let us explore the final sub-wave [C] unfolding as a
five-wave impulse (1)-(2)-(3)-(4)-(5). The final leg of corrective sub-
wave (4) — impulse C — is developing. This impulse should soon end, and
the price will rise in the final fifth wave to the previous high of
4360.00.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Buy 4129.21, TP 4360.00
