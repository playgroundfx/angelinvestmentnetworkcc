Gold believes in the Fed's lies. Forecast as of 25.10.2021Dmitri
Demidenko

When the Fed is inactive, the [XAUUSD][1] bulls look encouraged. This
was the case in the spring of 2021, and it is happening now. While FOMC
officials say it is too early to raise rates, the gold price is rising.
But aren't they lying? Let us discuss the Forex outlook and make up a
gold trading plan.

## Quarterly fundamental gold forecast

The return of the gold price to $1,800 per ounce looks paradoxical
against the background of the USD strong position, the rapid growth of
Treasury bond yields and the flow of capital from gold-oriented [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/)s to
the cryptocurrency market. Some immediately recalled the dubious
function of gold as an asset that protects against inflation. However,
it has [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/)ly been proven that [XAUUSD][1] is less responsive to
price rise than to real US debt rates. What happens to the precious
metal?

In my opinion, the reason is the Fed's desire to hide its own mistake.
For a long time, central bank officials talked about the temporary
nature of high inflation. They now continue to adhere to this mantra,
but clarifying that this period may be longer than expected due to
supply shocks. However, [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) shows that supply chain disruptions were
not the cause of high consumer prices. This was the case in Japan in the
1970s, when, despite the rise in oil prices, the CPI remained low. This
is currently the case in China. The PRC, like the rest of the world, is
facing both supply shocks and an energy crisis, but consumer prices
there are growing by less than 1%.

The acceleration of inflation is taking place in countries that used
large-scale incentives to overcome the financial crisis. According to
Milton Friedman, inflation is always and everywhere a monetary
phenomenon. The fact that due to the crazy monetary expansion of the
Fed, the money supply will increase by $10.6 trillion from 2020 to 2024,
and only $2.4 trillion of that will be absorbed by the economy, speaks
of the high CPI's long-term nature.

Both the Fed and the Treasury Department's head Janet Yellen, that
argues that the United States has not lost control of inflation, are
wrong. Consumer prices will continue to grow by 4-5% in the second half
of 2022, which will force the central bank to aggressively raise rates.
This is bad [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) for gold. At least in the long run. In the meantime,
the [XAUUSD][1] bulls go ahead thanks to an equally rapid rise in
inflation expectations compared to the rally in US Treasury yields. As
you know, the precious metal is sensitive to the dynamics of real
interest rates on debt.

Gold is supported by rumors that the Fed will not raise rates earlier
than fall 2022 due to fears that such actions will lead to global
stagflation. This forces [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s to exit USD longs. However, in
reality, the central bank keeps something back. Jerome Powell calls for
patience so the job market can recover. The head of the Fed leaves a way
to retreat, arguing that with the further acceleration of inflation, the
Fed will not remain passive.

### Quarterly gold trading plan

Next year, I expect not only the tapering of the US QE program, but also
an increase in the federal funds rate. This circumstance makes the
potential for a gold rally limited. XAU growth towards $1820, $1835 and
$1850 per ounce should be used to enter sales.
