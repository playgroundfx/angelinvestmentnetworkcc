Ethereum Price Predictions: 2021 and BeyondJana Kane

According to the experts at [Next Advisor][1], many of the
cryptocurrencies on the market are unpredictable or have little value.
ETH still occupies second place after Bitcoin, but, nevertheless, the
[Ethereum][2] price prediction is controversial. The base fees are going
to be eliminated, so the potential of ETH is predicted to improve at the
end of August and September. However, the future is not all that bright.
Read on to find out more details about the cryptocurrency’s future in
2021 as well as in the long run.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Ethereum in Short

Like Bitcoin, Ethereum is a separate [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) that has its own digital
currency. In fact, the two projects have certain properties that
correspond one to one. For example, both coins are decentralized. No
country or government backs Bitcoin or Ethereum. Furthermore, both
digital currencies are built on [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) technology so that all
transactions are fast, accurate, and transparent.

However, this is where the similarities end. Ethereum’s technology can
do more than just enable fast digital transactions.

For example, Ethereum offers [smart contract](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/smart-contract-on-blockchain/) technology. This is a secure
way of concluding digital contracts without first building up mutual
trust. Ethereum transfers are also faster than Bitcoin's, and its
[blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) technology can handle more transactions than Bitcoin's.

Most people buy Ethereum on a speculative basis. That means that people
invest in the crypto coin to make money from it.

## Importance of the Network Effect

The biggest advantage of Ethereum is the network effect. It is the first
and, therefore, the [most popular][3] [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) for [smart contract](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/smart-contract-on-blockchain/)s.
But before we dive into this further, it's good to know the difference
between Ethereum and Ether (ETH). These [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) are often used
interchangeably.

By Ethereum, we mean the network and the [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/). You can find all
transactions of a cryptocurrency on a [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/). And on Ethereum,
transactions are paid with ETH. That is the cryptocurrency that comes
with Ethereum. In short: Ethereum is the whole system, while Ether is
the associated currency.

## A Little History of Ethereum

Unfortunately, even we don't have a crystal ball. Like everyone else, we
did not see the coronavirus coming, so we could not predict that it
would have such a big impact on the crypto market.

In 2017 and early 2018, the price of ETH grew almost exponentially. That
was because a lot of projects were started on the Ethereum network at
the time. This was done through Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs). These
projects all had their own coin. As an [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/), you could participate
in these projects by sending them ETH. In exchange, you received these
new tokens. ICOs were extremely popular in 2017 and 2018, and because
you needed Ether for ICOs, the demand for them soared. Due to that
demand, the price rose to unprecedented heights.

The era of ICOs is over. Regulators have taken care of that. Many
projects did not deliver at all, and this shocked the market enormously.
Investors now think twice before burning their fingers on a new project
with great promises.

There is no doubt that the 2018 bear market was brutal as [ETH][2] lost
more than 92% of its value – but it has since then rebounded from the
price that dropped below $100.

The Ethereum [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) remains unquestionably the most robust smart
contract platform out there. Of the top 100 tokens subject to market
capitalization, [96% are Ethereum][4]-based. Of the 1,000 best tokens,
89% consist of Ethereum.

## Two Important Developments in 2021

Two major developments can push the course of Ether to new heights. The
first is the introduction of a new algorithm called proof-of-stake. The
second one is the development of DeFi.

### Ethereum 2.0

With the renewal of Bitcoin's historic high, all attention is riveted on
it: volumes and interest are growing, and new institutional [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s
are coming. However, crypto [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s with a long-term planning horizon
prefer Ethereum 2.0: the project already reached the TOP-30 in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of
capitalization.

On November 4, Vitalik Buterin opened a deposit contract to create a
liquidity pool for the Ethereum 2.0 network. At that moment, crypto
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s had reserved 1.7 million ETH.

 _Image source: etherscan.io_

The ETH 2.0 [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) upgrade is not currently presented on rating
resources since it will take several years before the network is fully
deployed. Validators reserve funds in blocks of 32 ETH to participate in
staking. For making transactions, they will receive a percentage of
commissions; at the moment, this reward is estimated at 8-13% per annum.
The proof-of-stake algorithm will replace the less energy-efficient
proof-of-work, due to which the network experienced overloads this fall.
And [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s will receive new coins in exchange for old Ethereum in a
1: 1 ratio. A reverse transition is not possible.

Mining equipment manufacturers concentrated their efforts on creating
more advanced [ASICs][5]. The network hash hit its [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) maximum in
May.



 _Image source: etherscan.io_

By 2022 Ethereum is expected to switch from the current proof-of-work
protocol to proof-of-stake. Miners won’t need energy-intensive mining
anymore. Instead, staked Ether is going to secure the network. Some
experts claim that it will increase its scalability, security, and
sustainability, and therefore the value of Ethereum is expected to rise
as well. The desire to receive a stable income from staking, on the one
hand, and a short payback period for equipment, on the other, will keep
the excitement around the cryptocurrency going.

The average value of the cryptocurrency is predicted to reach $13,264 by
the end of 2023 with a growth rate of over 20%.

### DeFi

A very important development in recent times is the growth of DeFi. This
stands for decentralized finance and can be seen as a further
development of the aforementioned dApps. DeFi companies are service
providers that provide loan services on the Ethereum [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/), for
example, where only a [smart contract](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/smart-contract-on-blockchain/) is required for the export.

Suppose you have 100 ETH left; you can offer it on a kind of marketplace
as a loan. Someone else can agree to this; the conditions are poured
into a [smart contract](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/smart-contract-on-blockchain/), and the borrower offers collateral. Nothing more
is needed.

Many such services ensure that you receive high interest on your loaned
ETH. And by high, we mean interest that our parents talk nostalgically
about.

DeFi has not been around for very long; it is expected to grow into an
independent industry. Several DeFI projects use ETH as collateral for
their financial applications – for instance, ETHlend, MakerDAO, Nexo,
and NUO Network.

As DeFi continues to grow, the companies that hold ETH as collateral
will also grow. So, it’s a great idea to keep an eye on Ethereum
updates!

## The Introduction of Sharding

"Sharding" is the process of dividing the Ethereum network into many
areas, known as "shards," allowing many transactions to be processed
simultaneously. Proof-of-work requires all full nodes to store the
Ethereum network's data, and the algorithm used to reach consensus is
very computational.

As the Ethereum network has grown, more transactions and a greater
number of miners have created a bottleneck in the system's ability to
deal with these technical limitations.

Sharding is one way of addressing this problem by distributing data and
transaction processing [functions](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/basic-functions/) among different nodes within the
network. All nodes no longer need to store all data and process all
transactions. Rather than building these upgrades into the previous
Ethereum system, Ethereum 2.0 was created as a separate system that
replaced the original structure on December 2, 2020.

Suppose the changes implemented by Ethereum 2.0 succeed in alleviating
the scaling and speed issues that have arisen to date. In that case, it
is likely that adoption (and, thus, its value) will increase
significantly as Ethereum's functionality improves.

## Ethereum price forecast for 2021

ETH, like the rest of the market, is at the center of Bitcoin's price
action. So, when Bitcoin starts a bull run, ETH can also hope for it.

With the pandemic outbreak, the world hibernated for a few months, and
it negatively impacted cryptocurrencies, causing Bitcoin to go downhill
as we recorded even 40% [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) losses. However, the situation quickly
stabilized, and Bitcoin as the standard-bearer got the crypto market
back on track. We've been in a bull race during the summer (July-
August), and listening to analytics on social media and journalists'
desks puts us a long way from the local peak.

As long as Bitcoin is in the lead and moves up, ETH will usually do the
same. ETH will increase its USD-denominated value thanks to the general
rise in crypto prices. The ratio between ETH and BTC is likely to
decline. Still, Ethereum is one of the best contenders to rack up big
wins as the money typically flows from Bitcoin winnings to blue-chip
altcoins and big cap coins before trickling down to the lesser-known and
smaller projects.

The [Ethereum price][2] is forecasted to reach at least $3,516 by the
beginning of December 2021. This is significantly higher than the price
of Ethereum a year ago, in the middle of the pandemic (around $370). The
value of ETH in USD has grown from $732.73 at the end of December 2020
(BinanceUS) to an all-time high of $4,362.35 on May 12, 2021. This
upward trend lasted until the 11th of May. Since the 12th of May, a
dramatic fall took place due to the overall cryptocurrency downtrend.
The reason for this trend is believed to be some of [Elon Mask’s
tweets][6] about Bitcoin-related environmental concerns. The price went
down from $4,179.76 on the 11th of May to $2,099.58 on the 23rd of May.

## What Experts Predict

As mentioned above, the fate of Ethereum is tied to the fate of Bitcoin.
Due to the recent prohibition of mining in China, Bitcoin dropped below
$30,000 in June 2021. Ethereum had no choice but to follow right behind
it.

All Ethereum holders would love the positive predictions to be true.
Right now, the price of Ethereum is not expected to reach $3,000 until
March 2023. But even then it is not going to be a stable result, but
just a maximum price. The average Ethereum price won’t reach $3,000
sooner than September 2024.

Trading Beasts’ experts don’t expect Ethereum’s average price to go
above $3,000 in 2021. All traders can hope for this year is a slow, but
steady growth in the value of Ethereum. The maximum is predicted to be
reached in December - $2,856.961. The minimum price in September is
expected to be $2,256.266. No dramatic falls are predicted, which is
good [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/). The average price will move from $ 1,723.23 (July) to
$2,856.961 (December).

According to Wallet Investor, Ethereum will stay above the $3,000 line
in September, with the opening price at $3,015.600. The highest price
will be on the 31st of December - $4,008.200, while the average one will
reach $3,724.940. The minimum is $2,732.410 on the 1st of September. The
overall trend is bullish.

The Economy Forecast Agency gives a more optimistic prognosis. Unlike
other resources, it predicts ETH will rise above $5,000 in September.
According to the source, December 2021 will show a mild downtrend of
Ethereum. The price on the last day of 2021 is expected to be $4,440.

Coin Price Forecast has quite ambitious thinking. Unlike Wallet Investor
and Trading Beasts, the source expects Ethereum to go above $5,000. By
the end of December, the price is going to reach $5,107.

## Ethereum (ETH) Technical Analysis

Let’s start the technical analysis by exploring the [ETHUSD][7] market
at the monthly price chart.

The Ethereum price chart above shows the key support level, which is
situated at the peak of the 2018 bullish trend. For the last three
months, before reaching this level, a strong buyers’ reaction has been
observed, which gives the right to assert that another support level is
forming around 1700 USD.

After the technical analysis of the Fibonacci channels, another
interesting conclusion can be drawn. If to take the price movement at
the bottom of the bullish trend at the end of 2020 as a basis, then the
Fibonacci channel extension levels show limitation of ETH’s bullish
potential, where the [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) high of 4366 USD formed exactly at the
Fibonacci level of 4.236. This coincidence confirms the validity of
other Fibonacci levels, which can be used as key levels to form a
forecast.

Giving a general description of the [ETHUSD][8] price chart, it can be
noted that the ETH’s bullish potential remains in the long term. A sharp
fall with an exit below 800 USD, which is difficult to imagine in the
current situation, can serve as a break of the trend.

### ETH price prediction for next three months

Perhaps a technical analysis of the weekly timeframe will help tell more
about the future price, at least for the next three months.

The [ETHUSD][2] [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) price movement in the chart above indicates
strong support in the zone of 1700 - 1800 USD. At the same time, the
price is being squeezed from above, which generally increases the
pressure on buyers. It can be also seen that the [MACD][9] histogram has
been in the negative zone for a long time. Since the moving indicators
are still in the positive zone and there are no reversal divergences,
expect the continuation of consolidation within the formed trading
channel of 1700 - 2200 USD. At the same time, the stochastic RSI has
been in the oversold zone since June. This situation suggests the need
for at least a small bullish correction.

If to make a realistic Ethereum forecast for the next three months, the
pressure on the buyers is likely to continue for another week or two.
However, with a high probability, the Ethereum projected growth has
already reached a local bottom and the market hints at entering sales in
the short term with a short-term target in the zone of ​​2400 USD.

### Monthly Ethereum price forecast for 2021/2022

Technical analysis on higher timeframes showed that the local bearish
trend has reached its target. Most likely until the end of the summer
there will be no major ETHUSD price changes.

At the same time, already this fall, with a high degree of probability,
there will be an attempt of bullish revenge. The market will need to
make a decision, which will determine whether an attempt to retest a
[historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) high or another stress test for the buyer will occur. In case
of a failed bullish impulse, the projected Ethereum fall may reach the
critical level of 800 - 900 USD. If the bulls succeed, the future price
can rise to 4200 USD or even higher.

Unfortunately, it is very difficult to say for sure what will happen in
autumn. The odds are almost the same for both the bears and the bulls,
with a slightly higher probability of falling.

Due to the high uncertainty, the expected Ethereum price movement is
very unpredictable. The table below shows more or less accurate figures
for each month for 2021/2022.

#### Long-term Ethereum trading plan

Let's make up an [ETHUSD][2] trading plan based on the most likely
scenario.

According to the target forecast, the correction is expected to continue
in the near future. Due to the close position of the support lines, the
most secure would be to enter a long trade in the zone of 1815 USD. At
the same time, the stop should be below 1740 USD. Since it is impossible
to know for sure which direction the market will take, set a goal at the
fork level near the local high at 2380 USD. The estimated target date is
September/October 2021. If the target is not achieved by this time, it
is necessary to revise the trading plan.

## Weekly Elliott wave Ethereum analysis as of 25.10.2021

The ETHUSD market finished the long-term corrective trend as a simple
zigzag A-B-C in spring 2021. Next, there started the new bear trend,
likely unfolding as a simple zigzag A-B-C. So far, the first leg of the
potential zigzag, impulse wave A. There is forming the corrective upwave
B. Let us explore the structure of the B wave in a shorter timeframe.

The current structure of the B wave looks like a simple zigzag
[A]-[B]-[C], which is about to end. Sub-wave [A] is an impulse
(1)-(2)-(3)-(4)-(5). The [B] wave has a zigzag-shaped structure composed
of sub-waves (A)-(B)-(C). The final sub-wave [C] is a five-wave impulse
1)-(2)-(3)-(4)-(5), which will soon be concluded by the sub-wave (5).
The Ethereum price could go up to a level of 4360.00, marked by the
large impulse wave C. Once the indicated level is reached, the price
will go down in the new impulse wave.

## Ethereum Price Prediction for 2022 by Crypto Experts

Predictions for 2022 vary from the minimum price of $2,451.577 to almost
$15,000. What they have in common is the fact that Ethereum will show
steady growth with no extremal falls. The speed of this growth is what
the sources see differently. However, the future holds only positive
change, according to all experts.

Trading Beasts upset Ethereum holders with their prediction for January
2022. According to them, the year will begin with a minimum price of
$2,451.577, which is even lower than now. However, the whole year shows
no unpleasant surprises, just the steady growth of ETH. The maximum
price of $3,965.369 will be reached in December 2022.

Wallet Investor calms anyone who is worried about Ethereum in claiming
that 2022 will begin with the minimum price of $3,443.540. The average
price will be $4,850 in July. December will lighten up the mood with a
maximum price of $6,405.500.

The Economy Forecast Agency’s predictions are the most optimistic. As
you can see below, in December, Ethereum is going to fly above $15,000.
The price will be more than double in 2022. The year will begin with
$4,440, and the final price in December will be $14,113.

A less shocking result is shown by Coin Price Forecast. The experts
there think that Ethereum will reach $6,938 by the end of 2022. The
first half of 2022 is going to show rapid growth, up to $5,337. Then
this rise will slow down, but no large falls are expected.

## Ethereum Price Prediction for 2023 by Crypto Experts

As Ethereum expert David Cox said, Ethereum, just like any other
cryptocurrency, is sensitive to [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)’ and regulatory’ changes. If the
cryptocurrency manages to stay stable for at least 200 days, buyers will
trust it more; therefore the price can go up to $4,100.

January 2023 will begin with a minimum price of $2,718.576. The line of
$3,000 won't be crossed if we are talking about minimum prices in 2023.
The average price throughout the year will be within $3,198.324 -
$3,468.620.

Wallet Investor’s predictions are twice those of Trading Beasts.
According to the experts, the year will begin with $5,834.970. No harsh
downs or quick ups are reserved for Ethereum in 2023. The average price
will go from $5,834.970 to $7,913.660 on the 31st of December.

The Long Forecast predicts several ups and downs for Ethereum. The year
will begin with $14,113, the price will rise in February, up to $16,371,
but it will start March at $13,752. After that, ETH will grow until May
- when it will be $18,504. The second fall to $13,231 is expected in
June. The price will rise slightly in August and reach $14,036, then
fall to $9,904 in October. The end of December will bring $13,264.

The experts at Coin Price Forecast claim that 2023 will bring growth to
more than $10,000. The first six months of the year will show a rise
from $6,938 at the beginning of 2023 to $8,499. December 2023 will bring
us up to $10,029.

## Ethereum Price Prediction for 2025-2030 by Crypto Experts

“Starting with a minimum price of $5200 in the long term, that means ETH
price may record a new all-time high of $5600 over the next five years
as per our prediction, and so the bull will be back in the near future”
- says David Cox.

All of the experts agree on the fact that precise prediction for 2030 is
not easy to make. The further ahead we go in time, the shadier the
picture becomes. Several Top Crypto [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s and hedge fund financiers
like Dan Morehead and others support the forecast that says that in 10
years, ETH will get to $100,000 per coin.

Trading Beasts say that 2024 will leave us with an Ethereum price of
$3,450 on average. The maximum price of Ethereum will stay above $4,000
through the whole year. The minimum price will rise above $3,000 only in
October.  There are no details about what happens afterwards.

Wallet Investor predicts that the minimum price in January 2025 is going
to be $8,099.440. Ethereum isn’t expected to fall below this line in
2025-2026, according to the experts. The maximum price during these
eighteen months will be $15,067.00.

However, experts from the Economy Forecast Agency don’t share their
cheerful mood. Here is their prognosis for the first half of 2025.

Predicting prices for new, highly volatile, and risky asset classes is a
thankless task - the best answer is that no one knows. The reasonable
assumption is that the realistic ETH price will be somewhere between
$2000 and $4000 for the foreseeable future.

2024 will end with $10,010 for Ethereum. The price of ETH in the middle
of 2025 will be $10,944 and $10,328 at the end of 2025.  Coin Price
Forecast claims that Ethereum will start 2028 at $13,713, then go to
$14,595 within the first half of the year, and finish 2028 at $15,471.
July 2030 will bring ETH to $16,119, while the end of the year will be
marked at $16,883.

## ETH Historical Price Changes

We can’t simply make price predictions without looking back. Currently,
ETH is traded at $4 192.03. Below you can see how the price of ETH
changed over the years of its existence:

Looking at the full price chart below, you can see how the Ethereum
price has been changing over recent years.

January 2018 began with a price near $1,300. In April 2018, Ethereum
experienced a price below $400. Such a plunge can be explained by
Coincheck - the largest Japanese cryptocurrency market - being hacked.
The decline was shown until November across all cryptocurrencies. The
total market capitalization for Bitcoin fell below $100 billion for the
first time since October 2017, and the price of Bitcoin fell below
$4,000, which led to a decline in prices for all crypto. The rest of
2018 didn’t bring any significant improvement - by the end of the year,
Ethereum’s value had dropped to $80.

During the first half of 2019, ETH grew to above $300 by June. Ethereum
was joined in its success by its elder sibling Bitcoin. Ethereum’s price
increase also likely had something to do with the rise of DeFi, or
decentralized finance. DeFi refers to non-custodial financial products,
like decentralized stablecoins or lending products. Most DeFi protocols
are based on Ethereum.

ETH didn’t manage to hold its position. ETH continued to drop in value
throughout August. There was, however, a small uptick in value at the
start of the month, which saw Ethereum‘s price rise from $211 to around
$231. The cryptocurrency fell again by December 2019. In early December,
[US authorities arrested Ethereum developer Virgil Griffith][13] for
consulting with North Korea on [how to](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-trading-how-to/) use cryptocurrency to evade
sanctions. In the middle of December, UK [cryptocurrency exchange](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/best-cryptocurrency-exchange/)
Coinfloor said it would delist Ethereum and Bitcoin Cash.

2020 showed growth up to $290 in January. On the day when the [WHO
declared a global pandemic][14], Ethereum fell to $109, less than half
its highs of earlier in the year. At the start of December 2020,[ the
Ethereum 2.0 upgrade got under way][15]. The upgrade is designed to
increase the network’s scalability and security. Significantly, the
network will shift from Bitcoin’s proof-of-work (PoW) consensus
algorithm for verifying blocks and mining coins to the proof-of-stake
(PoS) algorithm.

From January 2021 to April 2021, the price of Ethereum rocketed. It was
only at $1,385.5 in January, but during just five months, the price
reached $4,000. It happened due to the upgrade and shifting to the PoS
protocol. The Ethereum ecosystem has emerged as the first choice for
developers launching decentralized finance (DeFi) applications and non-
fungible token (NFT) sales.

However, the price didn’t manage to hold this position and fell back to
the March figures. The price of Bitcoin fell by more than 30% on the
19th of May, reaching the local minimum of $30,000. As a result,
Ethereum fell to $1,800.

It was a stepping stone for Ethereum to transition to [a PoS
protocol][16]. Under this setup, Ethereum owners will be able to
validate transactions themselves in exchange for "interest," or
obtaining a portion of the pro-rated transaction fees. Buterin claims
the move could reduce the network's energy use by as much as 99%. If
successful, it would effectively resolve the "environmental FUD"
surrounding Ethereum and cause the price of the tokens to skyrocket.

However, there is a fly in the ointment. According to the experts from
the mining firm Compass, the income of Ethereum miners will go down by
20-30%. The London protocol has already burned more than 31500 ETH. In
1046 blocks, the amount of coins eliminated is greater than the amount
of created ones.

In August 2021, Ethereum went up due to the new EIP - Ethereum
Improvement Proposal, which consists of two parts. It allows Ethereum
holders to pay fewer transaction fees. Moreover, about 3 mln ETH are to
be removed from the market each year. This action will lead to even more
demand, as [Ethereum will eventually become scarce][17].

## Is Ethereum (ETH) a Good Investment?

Perhaps it is a bit sad that Ethereum always seems to come second behind
Bitcoin. Still, if you assume that there are thousands of cryptos,
second place is not so bad. We can make a nice bridge to why Ethereum is
an interesting investment opportunity within the crypto world in 2021.

Ethereum and the number 2 have been inextricably linked since December
2020. Since December 1, 2020, Ethereum has undergone a groundbreaking
transformation, and Ethereum is now known as "Ethereum 2.0".

In short, the main upgrade of Ethereum 2.0 over Ethereum 1.0 is in its
scalability. Ethereum 2.0 uses the technique of sharding for this. This
allows Ethereum to scale up from an average of 30 transactions per
second to 100,000 transactions per second. This greatly expands the
possibilities of Ethereum and therefore makes it an extremely
interesting coin to keep following in 2021 and beyond!
