Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 25.10.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

The short-term oil uptrend continues.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

The short-term oil uptrend continues. The Target Zone 2 85.44 - 84.93
serves as the growth target. Today the resistance level of 83.61 was
broken out, paving the way for reaching the target.

Level 83.61 serves as a mirror level. Slightly lower is the Additional
Zone 83.09 - 82.96, which also serves as a strong support level. The
trend border is shifted to levels 81.82 - 81.13. Taking into account all
the supports listed above, I suggest looking for purchases according to
the pattern.

A trend reversal is required for oil sales. To make it possible, a
breakout of level 81.13 is required.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

  1. Buy according to the pattern in Additional Zone 83.09 - 82.96. TakeProfit: Target Zone 2 85.44 - 84.93. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. Buy according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 81.82 - 81.13. TakeProfit: Target Zone 2 85.44 - 84.93. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

The short-term gold uptrend continued last Friday and the upper Target
Zone 1801-1797 was broken out. Then the price sharply went into
correction and tested the trend border 1795 - 1787, which was eventually
held. The price closed within the Intermediary Zone at the US trading
session.

Today the search for purchases according to the pattern with the target
at Friday's high, as well as in the Gold Zone 1818 - 1816 is of primary
importance.

The breakout of level 1787 and price consolidation below are required
for gold sales. In this case, the price can reach the lower Target Zone
1776 - 1772.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

Open buy positions according to the pattern in 1795 — 1787. TakeProfit:
Gold Zone 1818 — 1816. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

The euro has reached another target within the sideways trend, the level
of 1.1664. This led to the development of a correction, and now the
price is decreasing. The likely target of the price fall is the level of
1.1622. After testing the level, look for purchases with the same target
again.

The breakout of level 1.1664 and price consolidation above are required
for continuation of the short-term uptrend and reaching the upper Target
Zone 1.1718 - 1.1700.

To enter euro sales, it is required to break out the Additional Zone
around level 1.1622. In this case, it will be possible to consider short
trades with a target in the Intermediary Zone 1.1579 - 1.1570.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

Buy from the level of 1.1622. TakeProfit: 1.1665. StopLoss: 1.1606.
