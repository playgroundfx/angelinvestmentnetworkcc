Dollar holds back. Forecast as of 25.10.2021Dmitri Demidenko

The Bank of England is not afraid of a GDP downturn. The Fed’s situation
is different. Hiking interest rates could result in global stagflation.
How will the Fed’s actions affect the [EURUSD][1]? Let us discuss the
Forex outlook and make up a trading plan.

## Weekly US dollar fundamental forecast

The euro-area PMI is down to a six-month low of 54.3 in October; Goldman
Sachs cuts China’s growth forecast for 2022 from 5.6% to 5.2%, and
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s expect Christine Lagarde to sound dovish at the upcoming ECB
meeting. Furthermore, the US retail sales data are strong, the number of
jobless claims is down to a new pre-pandemic low, and the US composite
PMI is up to a three-month high, suggesting the US GDP should feature an
impressive start in the fourth quarter. Nonetheless, the [EURUSD][1] is
rising instead of falling! What’s the matter? Have financial markets
been confused?

The situation reminds me of the events of the second half of 2020. The
US economy is quickly recovering, the US stock indexes are rising, and
the Fed is passive, unwilling to normalize monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). Investors
believe the US economy will provide support for the rest of the world
and buy anything but the greenback. The [EURUSD][1] bulls are not
concerned about the problems of the euro-area and China’s economies as
they are backed by such a giant as the USA. The situation is similar to
the earlier events, isn’t it? But there is one exception.

At that time, the market firmly believed in the Fed's mantra about the
temporary nature of high inflation, since it had an example of the
previous crisis, when, despite large-scale fiscal and monetary stimulus,
consumer prices did not accelerate properly. Investors now have strong
doubts about the slowdown in CPI in the second half of 2022. This is
evidenced by the increase in the 10-year breakeven rate to 2.64%, the
highest level since 2012. According to Invesco estimates, the Fed's
injection into the financial system from December to August 2021
expanded the money supply by $5.5 trillion. It will grow by about $5.1
trillion by 2024, while the economy and savings will absorb only $2.4
trillion. The rest will fall into the inflationary system. High prices
have come to the United States for a long time, although Janet Yellen
says that the United States has not lost control over consumer prices.

Roughly the same thing is happening in other countries. Their advantage
is that due to their smaller scale and, accordingly, less impact on
global GDP, they can afford to raise the rates, while the USA cannot. It
is one thing if, in the current situation, monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) is tightened
by the Bank of England, it is another thing if the Fed does it. If
Jerome Powell and his colleagues give in to the CPI pressure, it could
lead to global stagflation! The UK can afford to tighten monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), the world economy cannot. Therefore, the UK bond yield is
growing faster than the US yield, contributing to the strengthening of
the pound and the euro against the US dollar.

### Weekly [EURUSD][1] trading plan

[EURUSD][1] bulls are driving the price up in the hope that the Fed
won’t raise the federal funds rate earlier than in September 2022. If
the price breaks out the resistance at 1.168-1.1685, it could continue
growing to 1.172 and 1.1745.
