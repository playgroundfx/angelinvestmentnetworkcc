XPTUSD forecast: Platinum will outperform goldDmitri Demidenko

## Fundamental platinum price forecast for today

### XPT/USD is rising much faster than XAU/USD

Happiness is quiet. Gold, being popular in the media, has been 33% up
from the March lows. Platinum, however, has gained 70%. It is not
surprising. When the global economy was recovering after the previous
crisis, the  [XPT/USD][1] was rising 35%-60% faster than [XAU/USD][2].
History repeats. Platinum is widely used in industry, so it is going to
grow on value stringer than gold, as the global industry is recovering.

According to the World Platinum Investment Council, because of the
pandemic, the demand for platinum has contracted by 11% in 2020, the
supply decreased by 14%. It should result in a deficit of 336,000
ounces. Earlier, the WPIC forecast a surplus of 247,000 ounces. However,
as the supply dropped more than expected, also because of the reasons
not related to COVID-19, and [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s’ demand is higher, the forecast
has been revised.

### Platinum supply

The WPIC notes that, after the capital outflows from the platinum [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/)s
in the first quarter, the [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/) platinum holding increased by 122,00
ounces in the second quarter. The demand for bars and coins increased by
133,000 ounces. The stocks held by exchanges almost doubled, having
reached 291,00 ounces. A positive change in the total platinum demand
allows the WPIC to revise up the forecast for the investment demand by
455,000 ounces compared to the previous gauge. Nonetheless, World
Platinum Investment Council expects the indicator to shrink by 15% on an
annual basis, as the [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/) holdings won’t exceed those reached in late
2019.

In fact, the [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/) holdings reached new all-time highs already in late
August. WisdomTree gives two reasons. First, a part of [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s missed
out on the gold rally and tried to catch up buying a cheaper metal.
Second, some [XAU/USD][2] bulls took some profits and invested in
platinum.

The WPIG notes the increased demand for autocatalysts in China, as the
Chinese economy is recovering. The forecast reads the demand will be 27%
up in 2020. However, other countries won’t demand as much platinum for
industrial needs. So, the total demand for platinum used automotive
industry should contract by 16%.

### Structure and dynamics of platinum demand

In general, the World Platinum Investment Council suggests a positive
outlook for  [XPT/USD][1]. Presumably, the market deficit and the fact
that the platinum is undervalued compared with gold or palladium.
Furthermore, the global economy is recovering, demanding more platinum,
so the platinum price should be rising. UBS also suggests the platinum
price rise to $975 per ounce by late September. WisdomTree expects the
price to break through the high of $1000 within the next twelve months.

Remember, my [July forecast][3] suggested the platinum price grow to
$940 and $1030 per ounce in three and six months. Everything has been
going according to the plan so far. I believe the investment demand and
the total demand for platinum will be higher than WPIC expects. So, I
expect the price to reach the above targets. I still recommend buying
[XPT/USD][1] on the price falls.
