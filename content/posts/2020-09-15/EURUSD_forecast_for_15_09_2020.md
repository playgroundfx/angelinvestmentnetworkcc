EUR/USD forecast: Dollar sends out an S.O.S.Dmitri Demidenko

## Fundamental US dollar forecast for today

### If the Fed calls for a fresh stimulus package, the US economy must
be turning down

If the EURUSD bears are supported by ECB that doesn’t want the euro to
appreciate, then the bulls follow the Fed. The US Federal Reserve
doesn’t yet resort to verbal intervention, but all its actions weaken
the US dollar. The [EUR/USD][1] is again at the top of figure 18, as
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s worry that Jerome Powell will sound dovish at the press
conference following the FOMC September meeting, and the global risk
appetite has increased.

The Fed doesn’t like engaging in the political debates, so when it does,
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s could see its call for a fresh stimulus package as a distress
signal. The disputes between the Republicans and the Democrats, holding
back the decision on the further financial aid programs, may completely
destroy the US economy by the time when the COVID-19 vaccines are
developed. So, the FOMC officials insist on a compromise for a boost in
the US fiscal stimulus.

According to Columbia University, when certain sectors of the economy
aren’t able to operate for non-economic reasons, a boost in government
spending is a more effective tool than the interest rate cuts. Around
half of economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal don’t see the Fed
raising rates before 2024. Futures markets show [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s expect the
first Fed rate increase in the second half of that year. The FOMC
interest rate decision will hardly surprise the market. The two Fed’s
hawks are likely to lower their forecasts for 2022 to zero.

I must admit the Fed has done a great job. It has stabilized the
financial markets and sent the Treasury yield to the all-time low. The
TIPS yield has gone negative, which makes [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s increase the
proportion of equities in their portfolios. So, the global risk appetite
increases, and financial conditions improve.

While Treasuries stay still in the consolidation, asset managers have to
focus on Forex if they want to make profits. The FX volatility is higher
than it was twelve months ago. Nomura's example is indicative. The
company bet on the rise of the Treasury yield amid the huge volume of
the Treasuries issue in summer. However, when it became clear that the
Fed’s purchases of the Treasuries will hinder the yield growth, so
Nomura started selling the US dollar.

Therefore, even if the Fed says nothing about the greenback weakening,
it doesn’t mean that it won’t try to do it. The Fed should keep the
interest rates low for a long time, the Congress can’t agree on the
additional government spending and the upcoming presidential elections
are associated with political uncertainty. All of these factors should
discourage [EUR/USD][1] bears. [As I noted][2] earlier, if the euro
breaks out the resistance at $1.192, it can well continue the rally. The
matter is whether the bulls will manage to break the strong level close
to 1.2.
