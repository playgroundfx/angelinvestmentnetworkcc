Euro needs an operation. Forecast as of 08.12.2020Dmitri Demidenko

The [EURUSD][1] will go down only if the European Central Bank takes
radical measures. Neither QE boost nor the verbal interventions can
discourage the euro bulls. Let us discuss the Forex prospects and make
up a trading plan.

## Weekly euro fundamental forecast

A puzzle: which economy is turning down and the financial markets are
rising? At first, it seems to be the USA, where the employment rate has
been shrinking for the seventh consecutive months. It means the US GDP
growth is slowing down, and the stock indexes are hitting all-time
highs. However, the right answer is the euro area. The euro-area economy
is about to face a double-dip recession, and the euro is rallying up.
The financial conditions in the euro area are much more controversial
than in the USA. In addition to the economic problems in the euro area,
there is the Brexit issue and the unwillingness of Hungary and Poland to
support the idea of the Rescue Fund. Furthermore, the ECB doesn’t want
the euro to strengthen.

According to a Bloomberg study, economic activity continues to slow.
This is especially acute in Germany, Italy, and Spain, where the rise in
the number of COVID-19 cases and the newly imposed restrictions are
pressing down the economy. It is natural that, under such conditions,
the ECB is eager to help it with additional monetary stimulus.

Under normal conditions, the monetary easing expectations, including an
expansion of the emergency asset purchase program by €500 billion and
its extension by 6-12 months, would most likely weaken the euro.
However, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are now more confident that the ECB can close bond
spreads than to bring the euro area out of deflation, not to mention the
ability to drive the CPI to its 2% target. Based on interest rate swaps,
inflation expectations indicate that consumer prices will rise by an
average of 1.25% over the next five years.

It is a paradox, but Christine Lagarde’s statement made 9 months ago
that the central bank should not interfere with the bond spreads
convinced [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s that this is what the ECB is doing now. The ECB
cannot say directly that it targets yields following the example of the
Bank of Japan, but the euro-area bond market rates signal that the
central bank controls the yields.

Foreign [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are willing to buy the Portuguese or Greek bonds, as
the ECB supports these papers. The capital inflow into the European
markets is a powerful growth driver for the [EURUSD][1].

How could the ECB officials surprise [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s? By the QE extension not
by six but by twelve months? Bloomberg has already revealed this
possibility. By verbal interventions? They don’t have a long-term
effect. Another matter is a sharp rate-cut. The euro-area economy has
experienced a shock that occurs once in a hundred years, so that it
could be a reason for the rate cut.

### Weekly [EURUSD][1] trading plan

I think the ECB won’t break the [EURUSD][1] uptrend even if it expands
the emergency asset purchase program, extends the QE through the middle
of 2022, or resorts to verbal interventions. If the pair drops below
1.208, there will be just a local correction encouraging [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s to
buy. Only radical measures of the central bank can turn the euro trend
down.
