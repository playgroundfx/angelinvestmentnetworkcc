Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 08.12.2020Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I suggest entry signals
to trade each cryptocurrency.

The XRPUSD market is now forming quite a large triangle. The triangle
should finish soon. Next, the market will start rising in the new
impulse wave.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

 ****

There continues forming the bullish impulse C that is composed of five
major sub-waves [1]-[2]-[3]-[4]-[5]. The price rose in the impulse wave
[3]. Next, after a short decline in correction [4], the market has
resumed rising in the final sub-wave [5]. Wave [5] is also an impulse.
The flat correction (4) should soon end as a triangle. It should
complete at a level of around 18863.98, which is a support level.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Sell 19161.75 TP 18863.98

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

 ****

In the most recent chart section, there is forming the bullish impulse
of a larger degree, with the horizontal corrective wave [4] unfolding as
a contracting triangle inside. This triangle is about to end soon. The
price may continue declining to a level of 0.561, which is the support.
Next, the currency pair should reverse and start rising in wave [5].

### Trading plan for **[XRPUSD][2]** today:

Sell 0.603, TP 0.561

* * *

## Elliott wave Ethereum analysis

 ****

The ETHUSD market is forming a similar pattern to that of other
cryptocurrency markets. There is now forming a large upward impulse C,
with the final wave [5] developing as an impulse inside. There is likely
to be forming the down corrective wave (4), which has a complex
structure. It is a triple zigzag w-x-y-xx-z. Most likely, this formation
will end at a level of around 562.20. Next, the price will be rising in
wave (5) as it is outlined in the chart.

### Trading plan for  **[ETHUSD][3] **today:

Sell 586.79, TP 562.20
