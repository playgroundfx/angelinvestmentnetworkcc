Weekly forecast for oil, gold and EUR/USDAlex Rodionov

##  **O** **il price forecast for next wee** **k: USCrude analysis**

This week, the oil price has corrected down to the key support of the
middle-term uptrend [37.34 – 36.72]. The zone hasn’t been broken out.
So, we still expect a pattern to buy. The buy targets are the high of
August and Target Zone 6 [49.17 – 48.42].

It will be relevant to sell oil when the price breaks out Target Zone
[37.34 – 36.72] and consolidates below. If so, the medium-term oil trend
will turn down, and the sell target will be the lower Target Zone 2
[31.14 – 30.52].

Next week, we shall define the oil trend for the next few weeks.

###  **[USCrude][1]Trading tips for the upcoming week:**

  1. Buy according to the pattern in Target Zone [37.34 - 36.72]. TakeProfit: 43.50. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. If the price breaks out Target Zone [37.34 – 36.72] and consolidates below, sell. TakeProfit: Target Zone 2 [31.14 - 30.52]. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

##  **Gold** **price forecast for next wee** **k:** **XAUUSD**
**analysis** ****

This week, the gold price broke the technical triangle pattern downside.
The support level was broken out, the price consolidated below.

Next, the price was corrected up and tested the broken-out support from
below. The price was trading for some time in the accumulation zone.
Now, gold is trading below the resistance again.

I recommend entering sell trades with the targets at the low of August
26, the low of August 12, and Target Zone 2 [1829.4 - 1820.1].

It is not relevant to buy gold yet.

###  **[XAUUSD][2] Trading tips for the upcoming week:**

Sell at the current prices. TakeProfit: 1862.3. StopLoss: 1968.7.

##  **E** **uro/dollar price forecast for next wee** **k:** **EURUSD**
**analysis** ****

This week, the EUR/USD traders were testing the key support of the
middle-term uptrend. They didn’t break the zone out. Buyers actively
reacted yesterday. The buy pattern will appear when the price breaks out
level 1.1918 upside. If so, we shall open long positions with the target
at Target Zone 5 [1.2096 – 1.2078].

If the price breaks out the support [1.1811 – 1.1791] next week, the
trend will turn down. In this case, we shall sell the euro and the
target will be the lower Target Zone 2 [1.1611 — 1.1591].

###  **[EURUSD][3] Trading tips for the upcoming week:**

  1. Buy according to the pattern in Target Zone [1.1811 - 1.1791]. TakeProfit: Target Zone 5 [1.2096 - 1.2078]. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. If the price breaks out Target Zone [1.1811 — 1.1791], sell according to the pattern on the retest. TakeProfit: Target Zone 2 [1.1611 - 1.1591]. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

> IZ - Intermediary Zone: responsible for the price momentum reversing

>

> TZ - Target Zone: a zone that is 75% likely to be reached after IZ
breakout.

>

> GZ - Gold Zone: zone in the medium-term momentum.

>

> All zones are calculated based on the average [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) price of the
instrument and margin requirements of the futures.
