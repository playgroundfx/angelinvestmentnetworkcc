GBP/USD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 11/09/2020 –
18/09/2020Alex Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions from corrections above the
level of 1.2718 with a target of  1.3197 – 1.3481.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
1.2718 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of 1.2489
– 1.2244.

## The pair [GBP/USD][1] is likely to grow. Estimated pivot point is at
a level of 1.2718.

 **Analysis:** Presumably, the first wave of larger degree (1) continues
developing on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame, with wave 3 of (3) formed inside. A
local correction is forming as the fourth wave 4 of (3) on the H4 time
frame. On the H1 time frame, presumably wave a of 4 of smaller degree
has formed and an ascending correction is starting to form as wave b of
4. If the presumption is correct, the pair may be expected to rise to
the  levels of 1.3197 – 1.3481. The level of 1.2718 is critical in this
scenario as the breakout will enable the pair to continue declining to
the levels of 1.2489 – 1.2244.
