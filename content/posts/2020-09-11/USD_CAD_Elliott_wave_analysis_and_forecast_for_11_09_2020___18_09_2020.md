USD/CAD:Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 11/09/2020 –
18/09/2020Alex Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions from corrections above the
level of  1.2993 with a target of 1.3388 – 1.3629.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
1.2993 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of 1.2900
– 1.2800.

## [USD/CAD][1] is correcting, still likely to grow. Estimated pivot
point is at a level of  1.2993.

 **Analysis:** An ascending corrective wave of larger degree (B) of 4
has finished developing on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame, and wave (C) of 4
started forming. Presumably, the first wave 1 of (С) has finished
developing and an ascending correction started forming as wave 2 of (C)
on the H4 time frame. Apparently, wave a of 2 of smaller degree is
developing on the H1 time frame. If the presumption is correct, the pair
may be expected to rise to the levels of 1.2900 – 1.2800. The level of
1.2993 is critical in this scenario as the breakout will enable the pair
to continue rising to the levels of 1.2900 – 1.2800.
