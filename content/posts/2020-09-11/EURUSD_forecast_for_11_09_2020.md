EUR/USD forecast: Euro doesn’t believe its luckDmitri Demidenko

## Fundamental euro forecast for today

### EUR/USD bulls do not believe Christine Lagarde’s optimism

ECB is monitoring the euro exchange rate, but it is not willing to start
a currency war now. Christine Lagarde expressed optimism about the euro-
area economic recovery, the ECB president hasn’t signaled the further
monetary easing in the near future. Lagarde’s speech should have
encouraged the [EUR/USD][1] bulls, but they didn’t believe the good
[news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/), so they didn’t go ahead. It looks like a catch. The ECB officials
express concerns about the euro strengthening ahead of the Governing
Council meeting, and, next, the ECB president sounds hawkish.

At the press conference, Christine Lagarde several times stressed that
exchange rates and the euro appreciation were not the ECB [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) target.
However, the exchange rate was the most discussed topic at the Governing
Council meeting in September. According to a Reuters source familiar
with the matter, the ECB officials have agreed that the [EUR/USD][1]
rally resulted from a faster economic rebound in the euro area compared
to the US growth, the Fed’s easy monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), the increased
confidence in the currency bloc due to the management of the pandemic
fallout. Moreover, the upcoming presidential election in the US weighs
on the US dollar. Bloomberg’s leading indicators signal that the GDP
recovery is the fastest in Germany. After a temporary downturn in
France, Italy, and Spain on concern about the second wave of the
COVID-19 outbreak, the economic activity is gradually increasing. The
UK, US, and Canada persistently lag behind.

###  **Dynamics of the economic recovery**

Four sources on the ECB's Governing Council told Reuters that the ECB
acknowledges the negative effects of the euro's strength on inflation
and growth, but the central bank is not willing to start a currency war.
Speaking after the meeting, two sources said they saw $1.20 as not far
from the equilibrium exchange rate at present. According to Citigroup,
if the [EUR/USD][1] is up by another 5%, the European Central Bank will
take active measures. In the meanwhile, the regulator is carefully
monitoring the exchange rates of the regional currency. The Governing
Council [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers at the meeting considered adopting the language
used to stem the euro's previous rally, in early 2018, when the former
ECB President Mario Draghi described "volatility in the exchange rate"
as "a source of uncertainty", according to Reuters.

The Reuters sources say the southern countries of the eurozone are much
more concerned about the euro strengthening than the northern ones. The
Governing Council hawks wanted Lagarde to note the great progress in the
euro-area economic recovery. François Villeroy de Galhau, the governor
of the French central bank, insisted on this especially strongly.

So, the [EUR/USD][1] bulls feared verbal interventions, signals of
monetary easing, and the ECB willingness to follow the Fed’s example and
target the average inflation. None of the fears came true. However, the
euro hasn’t consolidated above $1.19. Are the buyers so weak? Or, they
could feel a catch and will resume attacks after the ECB officials’
speeches. I suppose both scenarios should be considered. If the euro
rises above $1.192, it will be relevant to buy. If it slides down below
the support levels of $1.1795 and $1.1765, we should sell the euro
versus the dollar.
