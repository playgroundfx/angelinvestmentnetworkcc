Elliott wave [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) forecast for Bitcoin, Ripple and EthereumRoman Onegin

##  **Elliott wave forecast for BTCUSD, ETHUSD, XRPUSD for today**

###  **Elliott wave[BTCUSD][1] analysis**

 ****

The most recent section of the BTCUSD price chart displays that the
market declines in wave [W], which is an element of the bearish double
zigzag. Wave [W] is composed of the sub-waves (A)-(B)-(C). The impulse
wave (C) is now unfolding. The corrective wave 4 must have concluded the
corrective pattern that is a double zigzag [w]-[x]-[y]. Over the next
few weeks, the market should be declining in wave 5 towards a level of
9700. Next, when the [W] zigzag completes, the market could be rising in
the linking wave [X] to a level of 10900.

###  **Elliott wave[XRPUSD][2] analysis**

 ****

The XRPUSD market is forming the middle part of the down impulse wave
(A). The bullish impulse 3 is now developing, and it is composed of the
sub-waves [1]-[2]-[3]-[4]-[5]. The corrective wave [4] should have
completed as a triple zigzag (w)-(x)-(y)-(xx)-(z). So, wave [5] has
started. If the presumption is correct, the price should be declining in
sub-waves 3-4-5 over the next few weeks, as it is outlined in the chart.

###  **Elliott wave[ETHUSD][3] analysis**

 ****

The ETHUSD market is forming the down impulse wave A, which is the
initial element of the new bear zigzag. The corrective wave [4] could
have completed as a simple zigzag (a)-(b)-(c) within the A impulse. The
market is now declining in the final wave [5]. Over the next few weeks,
the Ethereum price should be declining in impulse [5]. Next, the market
could turn up and start a new bull trend.
