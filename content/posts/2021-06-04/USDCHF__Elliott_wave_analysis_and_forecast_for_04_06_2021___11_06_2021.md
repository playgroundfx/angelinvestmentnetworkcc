USDCHF: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 04.06.2021 –
11.06.2021Alex Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions from corrections above the
level of 0.8945 with a target of 0.9169 – 0.9476.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
0.8945 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of 0.8869
– 0.8751.

 **Analysis:** Daily time frame: presumably, a descending first wave of
larger degree (1) of 5 has formed and an ascending correction is now
developing as second wave (2) of 5. On the H4 time frame, wave A of (2)
was formed, and, presumably, wave B of (2) finished developing.
Apparently, the wave C of (2) begins forming on the H1 time frame. If
the presumption is correct, the pair may be expected to rise to the
levels of 0.9169 – 0.9476. The level of 0.8945 is critical in this
scenario. Its breakout will allow the pair to continue falling to the
levels of 0.8869 – 0.8751.
