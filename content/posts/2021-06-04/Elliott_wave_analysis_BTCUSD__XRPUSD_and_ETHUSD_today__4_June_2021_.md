Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 04.06.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

In the near future, the prices of the three main cryptocurrencies should
be rising in the impulse.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

The most recent section of the BTCUSD price chart displays an upward
corrective wave [2] is unfolding as a double zigzag (W)-(X)-(Y). Wave
(W) and linking wave (X) have completed their pattern, while the last
wave (Y) is still unfolding. Wave (Y) has a complex structure and
consists of sub-waves W-X-Y. Probably, the last sub-wave Y is two-thirds
completed, so the price may rise within impulse [C] in the direction of
level 44500.00. At the indicated level, wave [2] will be 50% of wave
[1].

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 37516.00, TP 44500.00

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

It is clear from the most recent XRPUSD chart section, that the upward
wave of the linking wave (X) is likely unfolding as a simple zigzag
A-B-C. Probably, impulse C, the last wave of the indicated zigzag, is
already unfolding. Corrective wave [4] of this impulse, most likely, has
completed as a double zigzag (W) - (X) - (Y). Thus, shortly, the market
may rise to the top within the final wave [5] to the level of 1.300. At
this level, wave (X) will reach the Fibonacci level of 50% of wave (W).

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] today:

Buy 0.974, TP 1.300

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

The ETHUSD market must be developing an upward corrective wave 2 as a
simple zigzag [A] - [B] - [C]. Wave [C] is currently unfolding. Perhaps,
the first four parts of this wave have already been formed, so expect
the development of an upward wave (5). The predicted target of the
correction 2 completion is level 3340.00, at which the indicated
correction will reach the Fibonacci level of 61.8% of wave 1.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Buy 2686.26, TP 3340.00
