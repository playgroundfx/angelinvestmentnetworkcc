USDJPY: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 04.06.2021 –
11.06.2021Alex Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 110.93 with a target of 107.46 – 106.75.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
110.93 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 112.00 –
113.50.

 **Analysis:** Daily TM: apparently, a descending correction of larger
degree finished forming as wave B, and wave С started developing, with
the first wave (1) of С forming inside.

The third wave of smaller degree 3 of (1) continues developing on the H4
time frame, with wave i of 3 formed and downside correction developing
as wave ii of 3 inside. Wave (a) of ii formed as part of the downside
correction. On the H1 time frame, wave (b) of ii appears to be nearing
completion, with wave c of (b) nearing completion inside. If the
presumption is correct, the pair will continue to fall to the levels of
107.46 – 106.75 after correction. The level of 110.93 is critical in
this scenario as its breakout will enable the pair to continue growing
to the levels of 112.00 – 113.50.
