Where is Forex heading? Review as of 04.06.2021Dmitri Demidenko

With the end of the Donald Trump era, the uncertainty in Forex has
remained.

## The market is influenced by a snowball effect: the farther you roll,
the harder it gets

During Trump's presidency, the eccentric antics of the 45th president of
the US, who had a really loose tongue, were the main source of
uncertainty. The Republican was replaced by a Democrat, but the
uncertainty in the market has not disappeared. Now everyone is thinking
about whether or not inflation will accelerate to the levels of the
1970s, what will the Fed do, and will other central banks follow its
example? Forex cannot exist without uncertainty. There is always a
choice: jump into a position or close a previously opened trade.

> \- Honey, why are you standing at the window like that?

>

> \- ...to jump or to close, to jump or to close?

>

> \- Jump, I'll close.

With Joe Biden in power, the markets returned to normal. They react to
macroeconomic statistics and comments from central bank officials, trade
on the [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/), and ignore the events that made them worry a couple of
years ago. For example, the US is threatening to impose duties of $2
billion on imports from the UK and five other countries in retaliation
for the digital taxes they use against US tech companies. In 2018-2019,
tabloids would make a mountain out of a dust speck, and their materials
were full of phrases like "trade war", making [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s seriously
nervous. Today, the [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) went almost unnoticed. Wrong scale!

> \- Dad, if I find a thousand dollars, what should I do with it?

>

> \- Son, you must take them to the police immediately, so people will
say that you are an honest man!

>

> \- And if I find a million?

>

> \- Bring it home as fast as you can and hide it! If you have a
million, you won't care what people say.

For some, the return of the markets to a normal state is heart-warming,
for others, it seems that Forex has become boring and dull without
Donald Trump's accusations of Jerome Powell in all America's troubles,
without his carrot and stick [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) towards China, without talks about
the harm of a strong dollar. Everything in life is relative. It seems to
us that the mosquito squeaks disgustingly, but from its point of view,
it is a deafening cry that should paralyze its victim.

Curiously, it has been five months of the new US administration, and
business has no clear idea of ​​the US [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) towards China. The old
duties continue to operate, no one is going to introduce new ones.
Trying to scare the UK and other countries with revenge for the digital
tax looks like a pathetic parody compared to the aggressive policies of
Donald Trump. The copy is always worse than the original.

The place of trade wars as the main rate-forming factor in Forex was
taken by the Fed, which in no way can calm the nerves of [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s about
the acceleration of inflation. It is likely that the regulator is doing
this deliberately. After all, if you cannot solve a problem for a long
time, then subconsciously, in a way, it doesn't bother you anymore.
Thus, the uncertainty has not disappeared anywhere, and it is only
possible to find out the exact weather forecast for tomorrow only the
day after tomorrow. Everyone on the market cannot make money at the same
time! For most traders, life in Forex should be like a snowball: the
farther you roll, the harder it gets.
