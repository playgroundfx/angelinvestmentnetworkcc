Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 04.06.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

The priority pattern for selling the euro from the Intermediary Zone
1.2229 - 1.2220 with the target of 1.2134 yielded profits.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

Oil is trading in a correction to a short-term uptrend. Now the traders
are testing the resistance Micro-zone 68.79 - 68.72. Consider sales
according to the pattern with the target at the Additional Zone 67.94 -
67.81.

For purchases, a breakout of level 68.79 and price consolidation above
are required. In this case, the Gold Zone 69.73 - 69.46 will be reached
with a high probability.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

  1. Sell according to the pattern in Micro-zone 68.79 - 68.72. TakeProfit: Additional Zone 67.94 - 67.81. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. Buy when level 68.79 is broken out. TakeProfit: Gold Zone 69.73 - 69.46. StopLoss: 68.47.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

Yesterday, gold broke out the Intermediary Zone 1894 - 1891 and reached
the Target Zone 1871 - 1867. Thus, the short-term trend reversed down.
The further decline will depend on the traders' ability to break out the
Target Zone and consolidate the price below.

If the Target Zone is broken out, then the next target within the trend
will be the Gold Zone 1849 - 1846.

Now the correction is developing, the target of which is probably the
test of the new trend's border 1880 - 1878. After reaching the trend's
border, it will be profitable to look for sales according to the pattern
with the target at today's low.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

Sell according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 1880 - 1878.
TakeProfit: 1856. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

The priority pattern for selling the euro from the Intermediary Zone
1.2229 - 1.2220 with the target of 1.2134 yielded profits. The next
target of the short-term downtrend is Target Zone 1.2090 - 1.2072. If
the Target Zone is broken out, then look for sales down to the support
Gold Zone 1.2002 - 1.1993.

Otherwise, a correction will develop. A correction serves as an
opportunity for traders to consider new sales at favorable prices.
Favorable sell prices will be in the Additional Zone 1.2152 - 1.2148 and
the Intermediary Zone 1.2200 - 1.2192.
