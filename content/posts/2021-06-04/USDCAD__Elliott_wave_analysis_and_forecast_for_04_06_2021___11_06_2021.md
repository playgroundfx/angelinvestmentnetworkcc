USDCAD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 04.06.2021 –
11.06.2021Alex Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 1.2150 with a target of 1.1850 – 1.1700.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
1.2150 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 1.2361 –
1.2560.

 **Analysis:** wave (С) of 4 of larger degree continues developing on
the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame, with the third wave 3 of (C) forming inside. The
fifth wave v of 3 continues forming on the H4 time frame, with wave (v)
of v developing inside. Apparently, wave iv of (v) finished forming on
the H1 time frame, and the fifth wave of smaller degree v of (v) started
unfolding. If the presumption is correct, the pair will continue to drop
to the levels of 1.1850 – 1.1700. The level of 1.2150 is critical in
this scenario as its breakout will enable the pair to continue rising to
the levels of 1.2361 – 1.2560.
