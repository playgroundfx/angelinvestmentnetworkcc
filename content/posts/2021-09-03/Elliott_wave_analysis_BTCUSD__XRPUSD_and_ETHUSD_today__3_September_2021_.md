Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 03.09.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

The [cryptocurrency price](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/cryptocurrency-price/)s continue rising. One can still enter buy
trades on each cryptocurrency pair covered in the article.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

The BTCUSD market is forming the zigzag-shaped correction [B]. The first
two sub-waves have completed in the [B] wave, and the final leg, sub-
wave (C) is still developing. The (C) wave is a bullish impulse
1-2-3-4-5. Corrective wave 4 has recently completed as a double three.
There is unfolding wave 5, which should end soon at a level of 51100.00.
One could enter buy trades in the current situation.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 49716.00, TP 51100.00

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

The XRPUSD market is forming the upward impulse wave C, which will
conclude the linking wave (X). Wave C is composed of five sub-waves, and
four of them have finished. There is developing wave [5], which should
end at a level of 1.402. Therefore, I recommend entering purchases with
a target at the above-indicated level.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] **** today:

Buy 1.284, TP 1.402

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

The ETHUSD pair is forming a long-term corrective wave B, namely, its
final sub-wave [C]. Wave [C] is unfolding as a simple impulse
(1)-(2)-(3)-(4)-(5). After the corrective wave (4) completed as a flat,
the price has started rising in sub-wave (5). In wave (5), there must be
forming impulse 3, which should end at a level of 3950.00, as outlined
in the chart. One could enter purchases in the current situation.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Buy 3805.26, TP 3950.00
