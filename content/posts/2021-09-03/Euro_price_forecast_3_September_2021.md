Euro: from famine to feast. Forecast as of 03.09.2021Dmitri Demidenko

If the Delta, according to the Fed, will not affect the US growth, and
high inflation is a temporary phenomenon, the belief in the recovery of
their own economies forces other central banks to act. The ECB is no
exception. How will the change in the ECB stance affect the [EURUSD][1]?
Let us discuss the Forex outlook and make up a trading plan.

## Fundamental euro forecast today

The euro is growing irrespective of economic [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/). The [EURUSD][1] was
up to the middle of figure 18 when there had been bad [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) for the US
dollar about weak growth in private payrolls reported by the ADP. When
there was positive [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) for the greenback about narrowing the US trade
deficit, a decline in the number of new jobless claims, and strong data
on new orders for the US manufactured durable goods, the euro bulls have
ignored that. The pair has reached level 1.188 indicated [earlier][2],
and it could well go up above 1.2.

The euro has been rising against the greenback for nine trading days out
of ten, which has not happened for a long time. The main drivers for the
rally have been Jerome Powell's speech in Jackson Hole, the rise of
European inflation to 3%, and the hawkish tone of the ECB officials. The
Fed Chair has convinced financial markets that there is no need to be
afraid of the Delta, and high inflation is a temporary phenomenon. As a
result, there returns the macro-environment typical for the turn of
2020-2021. At that time, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s believed that humanity would be able
to defeat the pandemic despite the increase in the number of new
COVID-19 cases. The Fed’s passive attitude was expected to let the US
economic growth accelerate, and there would be a huge amount of ample
liquidity in the system.

The flood of liquidity continues at present. Moreover, according to
Credit Suisse, there's a seismic shift underway in money markets, the
equivalent of going from famine to feast. The premium paid for dollars
over the euro, Japanese yen, and so on in the cross-currency markets has
been negative for years. Now, these so-called cross-currency basis swaps
are about to turn positive in a major shift for money markets.
Differently put, there are so many dollars that no one wants them.

In such conditions, it is quite logical that much of the cheap liquidity
goes to the stock market. The [S&P 500][3] has been up by 22% since the
beginning of the year with 53 record closes and has not been corrected
down by 5% since October. Corrections of 1%-2% are immediately bought
out. High risk appetite presses down safe-haven currencies, including
the US dollar. Moreover, Reuters experts predict the euro will
strengthen against the US dollar by 2% within 12 months.

The current [EURUSD][1] rally results from the ECB’s willingness to take
the first step towards normalizing monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). According to
economists surveyed by Bloomberg, the central bank will reduce the
monthly pace of asset purchases under the PEPP from the current €80
billion to €50 billion in March. Around €70 billion of the €
1.85-trillion program will remain unspent.

### [EURUSD][1] trading plan today

Investors expect a weak report on US employment, pressing down the
dollar. The consensus forecast of Reuters experts suggests the US labour
market added 750,000 new jobs in August, while BofA expects an increase
of 600,000 because of the Delta. I believe if the US jobs report is
strong, the [EURUSD][1] will go down to the bottom of figure 18. If the
data are close to the median gauges, the greenback should also
strengthen. However, if non-farm payrolls grow by just 300,000-450,000,
the euro could go up to $1.1935 to and higher.
