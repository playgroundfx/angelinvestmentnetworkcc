European Central Bank copies Fed's innovations

## ECB is tired of waiting for its turn

If somebody doubts that central-bank policies determine currency rates,
look at two dates -- mid-June and early September. The Fed decided to
give up its tolerance [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) concerning fast-growing inflation and
hinted that rates might be raised in 2022 at its first meeting in
summer. As a result, the [EURUSD][1]'s uptrend reversed. Then, the ECB's
officials started talking at the borderline of August and September
about curtailing monthly assets purchases, and the euro soared to the
top of figure 18. Growing for nine days out of ten must mean something!
A new trend, at least.

The European Central Bank is simply tired of waiting for its turn to
normalize monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). Investors got used to thinking that balancing
on the edge of deflation is normal for the eurozone and Japan. And,
boom! The currency block’s consumer price index rockets to 3%, which was
last seen in autumn 2011! Back then, the ECB raised rates and thus
provoked the eurozone's subsequent economic slowdown. Christine Lagarde
and her peers will hardly want to repeat the mistake, but how can they
talk the market into it?

I hate two moments: when I need to set my alarm and when I need to turn
it off. Central banks hate it when they need to start introducing
monetary stimuli and when they have to withdraw them. That makes
everyone nervous, including financial markets. What is left to do is
follow the leaders. The Fed sometimes does that too. Do you think the
Fed was the first to introduce negative rates and use QE as a non-
traditional monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)? Nope! It was the Bank of Japan! By the way,
it never reached its CPI target.

The ECB has already started following the Fed. Christine Lagarde
implemented a similar strategy of average inflation targeting and thus
escalated debates within the Governing Council. Some of the members even
left the meeting, slamming the door. The good [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) is that they have
managed to reconcile with the Frenchwoman by September's meeting.

> I'm sorry, sweetheart! I was wrong! Let's make peace.

>

> All right! Wait, don't eat that. I'll cook something else.

Lagarde is facing a challenging task: to weaken the euro and please the
ECB's hawks that insist on a graduate cut in asset purchases. The two
missions seem incompatible as the [EURUSD][1]'s quotes are growing
exactly because the ECB intends to normalize monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). Actually,
there's a way out! To follow the Fed's example.

Why can't Lagarde say on 9 September there's no connection between a QE
taper and a rate hike, just like Jerome Powell did? The Fed President
had to gain time as he didn't know how the pandemic and the labor market
would develop. And he did that successfully: the USD's weakening is one
more step to better financial conditions.

Will Lagarde manage to fall asleep on the eve of the European Central
Bank's press conference in September? Why not? Her conscience is
unclouded.
