EURUSD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 03.09.21 – 10.09.21Alex
Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions from corrections above the
level of 1.1656 with a target of 1.2089 – 1.2269.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
1.1656 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of 1.1489
– 1.1286.

 **Analysis:** Daily chart: the first wave of larger degree 1 of (3) is
formed, and a downside correction appears to have formed as wave 2 of
(3). Apparently, wave с of 2 finished developing, and the third wave 3
of (3) started forming on the H4 chart. The first counter-trend wave of
smaller degree (i) of i of 3 is developing on the H1 chart. If this
assumption is correct, the pair will continue to rise to 1.2089 –
1.2269. The level of 1.1656 is critical in this scenario. Its breakout
will allow the pair to continue falling to the levels of 1.1489 –
1.1286.
