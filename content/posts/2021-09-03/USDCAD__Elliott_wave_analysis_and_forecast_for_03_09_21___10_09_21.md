USDCAD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 03.09.21 – 10.09.21Alex
Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions above the level of 1.2369
with a target of 1.3090 – 1.3413 after correction.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
1.2369 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of 1.2203
– 1.2002.

 **Analysis:** a descending correction appears to have formed as the
fourth wave 4 of larger degree on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) chart, with wave (С) of 4
completed inside. The fifth wave 5 started developing on the H4 chart,
with wave 1 of (1) of 5 formed and a descending correction developing as
wave 2 of (1) of 5 inside. Apparently, wave c of 2 is developing on the
H1 chart, with wave (iii) of c forming inside. If the presumption is
correct, the pair will continue to rise to the levels of 1.3090 – 1.3413
upon completion of correction 2 of (1). The level of 1.2369 is critical
in this scenario as its breakout will enable the pair to continue
declining to the levels of 1.2203 – 1.2002.
