Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 13.04.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

The BTCUSD market is forming an ending diagonal. Ripple and Ethereum are
rising in impulse waves.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

Bitcoin is forming wave 5 as an ending diagonal [1]-[2]-[3]-[4]-[5]. The
first two legs of the diagonal have competed, and there is now unfolding
its middle part, sub-wave [3]. Wave [3] is composed of three main sub-
waves (A)-(B)-(C), unfolding as a zigzag. The price has recently
finished declining in correction (B), which is a double zigzag W-X-Y.
There is now developing impulse (C), which is about to end soon. The
fourth wave of this impulse may have completed as a skewed triangle, as
its lines are directed towards the main trend. The price should be
rising in wave 5 of a smaller degree to a level of 63350.00.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 60607.50, TP 63350.00

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

The market continues rising in the impulse wave, which started
developing after the large triangle correction had finished. There have
completed waves (1) and (2), and there is now developing the bullish
impulse (3). Wave (3) is composed of sub-waves 1-2-3-4-5. The impulse
sub-wave 3 has correction [4], finished as a double three. Corrective
sub-wave 4 is a triangle. The sideways wave 4 could have completed, so
the price should be rising in the final fifth wave to a level of 1.730.
One could enter purchases in the current situation.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] today:

Buy 1.431, TP 1.730

* * *

## Elliott wave Ethereum analysis

The ETHUSD market continues developing the final leg of a large impulse
wave C. Let us look at the upward wave 5, currently unfolding as a
regular impulse. Its fourth wave, correction [4], must have completed as
a double three (W)-(X)-(Y). If the assumption is correct, the price
should be rising in the fifth wave to a level of 2300.00. Next, there
should start a new bearish trend with a target below the low of 1540.00.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Buy 2163.06, TP 2300.00
