Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 13.04.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

The euro is trading in a short-term uptrend with the target in the Gold
Zone 1.1952 - 1.1944.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

The short-term oil trend is down. Yesterday there was a rise in prices
associated with the accident in Iran. Investors have raised concerns
about the Iranian nuclear deal. But the accident was eliminated, the
guilty parties were found. The deal continues to be discussed.

The target of oil price decline will be levels 58.00 and 57.35. Hold
sales entered in the zone of ​​59.42 - 60.45.

Buy oil if the short-term trend reverses up. To that end, the market
needs to break out the resistance level of 60.70 and consolidate the
price higher at the US trading session.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

Hold down sales entered in the zone of 59.42 - 60.45. TakeProfit: 57.35.
StopLoss: 61.00

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

Yesterday, a decline in gold prices and a retest of the trend key
support 1733 - 1731 occurred. However, the price didn't break out the
zone. The US trading session closed within the range.

Now, the bears are trying to break out the Intermediary Zone and
consolidate the price below. The trend will reverse if the US trading
session closes the price below the level of 1731. The target for sales,
in this case, will be the lower Target Zone 1708 - 1703.

If the price returns to the support level and further breaks out the
level of 1735, a "false breakout" buy pattern will appear. Within this
pattern, open long trades with a target in the zone of ​​1757 - 1755.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

Buy according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 1733 - 1731.
TakeProfit: Zone 1757 - 1755. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

The euro is trading in a short-term uptrend with the target in the Gold
Zone 1.1952 - 1.1944. Yesterday, traders tested the Additional Zone
1.1887 - 1.1883. The price didn't break out the zone. A "double bottom"
buy pattern was also formed. Today it is profitable to consider
purchases in the Additional Zone according to the pattern with the
abovementioned target.

To enter sales, traders need to break out the key support - level
1.1862. A breakout and price consolidation below this level will lead to
an uptrend reversal down. Consider opening short trades with a target at
the lower Target Zone 1.1767 - 1.1751.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

Open buy positions at the current prices (1.1887). TakeProfit: Gold Zone
1.1952 - 1.1944. StopLoss: 1.1865.
