Euro is struck by the fever. Forecast as of 03.12.2020Dmitri Demidenko

The major currency pair continues to ignore negative factors. The euro
is following the [S&P 500][1] that hits fresh all-time highs. How long
will the rally continue? Let us discuss the Forex outlook and make up a
[EURUSD][2] trading plan.

## Weekly euro fundamental forecast

The fever, which has struck the US stock market, sends the [EURUSD][2]
above the bottom of figure 21, where the pair was last time in 2018. The
[S&P 500][1] bulls notice only positive [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) and ignore the negative, so
the stock indexes break through its all-time highs. Traders are
unwilling to sell the stocks as they know that the monetary and fiscal
stimulus will continue in the near future. They ignore the fact that the
US stock indexes are fundamentally overvalued as the market is ruled by
euphoria. It is really hard to remain sensible in this situation.

The [S&P 500][1] uptrend, which accelerated after the optimistic [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/)
about vaccines’ trials and lower political uncertainty in the USA in
November, should have exhausted. However, bulls are encouraged in early
December by the [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) about the negotiations' resumption on the US fresh
stimulus package. Democratic leaders in Congress have pledged to cut
claims from the current $2.4 trillion, arguing that the $900 billion
bailout offer could be a starting point for continued talks. Investors
hope that the agreement would be signed before the end of the year,
supporting the US stock indexes and sending the US dollar down.

In addition to the revival of the fresh US fiscal stimulus talks, the
idea of the reflation appears again. The next five and ten years'
inflation expectations have reached the highest level over at least the
last twelve months. Besides, the growth of the Treasury yields has been
suspended. Investors expect the Fed to launch the ‘operation twist’
already in December, focusing on long-term bond purchases. A decline in
the Treasury real yield is a bearish factor for the dollar. The USD
index has closely approached the lowest levels of 2018. If the greenback
breaks through the lows of 2018, it could crash down to the lowest
levels since 2014...

### Dynamics of USD index

When the global economy is generally strong, the greenback is weakening.
Therefore, the dollar sell-offs are fueled by the information that the
current crisis won’t be as dramatic as expected. At the beginning of the
year, the WTO suggested the international trade would shrink by 32% in
2020, which would be the worst drop since the Great Depression in the
1930s. Currently, international trade is 9.2% down, which is better than
the drop of 12% recorded during the previous recession.

The fever in the US stock market allows the [EURUSD][2] bulls to ignore
the negative. For example, ADP says private payrolls grew at their
slowest pace since July. The ECB officials sound dovish; they are
willing to expand the QE size and extend its term. Besides, Dallas Fed
President Robert Kaplan says the Fed, following the tough months for the
US economy, should consider reducing the volume of bond purchases. __

### Weekly[EURUSD][2] trading plan

In my opinion, the market should realize the real situation soon, which
will result in the [EURUSD][2] middle-term consolidation in the range of
1.18-1.22 or 1.19-1.23. Of course, I don’t recommend buying the US
dollar now, but you should be very careful with selling it.
