Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 03.12.2020Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I suggest entry signals
to trade each cryptocurrency.

The three cryptocurrency pairs covered in the article have a similar
market situation. The market should soon finish corrective movements,
and next the prices could start rising.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

 ****

In the upward impulse wave C, composed of five sub-waves, four sub-waves
have completed. There is now forming the concluding wave [5], which is a
five-wave impulse. The middle leg of impulse [5] should have ended, and
there is forming the bearish correction (4) as a zigzag a-b-c. The price
should be declining in impulse c. Next, the market will continue rising
in wave (5) to a level of 20000.00.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 18433.00. TP 20000.00

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

 ****

The XRPUSD market is following the impulse wave C that started in early
November 2020. After the sharp upward impulse [3] has finished, the
price dropped in the zigzag-shaped correction [4]. There is now forming
the middle leg of if impulse wave [5], which is the upward sub-wave (3).
The corrective movement in the bearish wave 4 should finish soon. Next,
the price could be rising in wave 5 to a level of  0.689, as it is
outlined in the chart.

### Trading plan for **[XRPUSD][2]** today:

Buy 0.617, TP 0.689

## Elliott wave Ethereum analysis

 ****

Like other major cryptocurrencies, the Ethereum market is forming a
bullish impulse. Within the C wave, there have completed the sub-waves
[1]-[2]-[3]-[4], wave [5] is about to end soon. It is also an impulse.
There must have finished wave (3), followed by the price decline in
correction (4). This correction may end as a simple zigzag a-b-c.
Impulse c should complete soon, and the price will resume growing in the
final wave (5), and the market should be growing to a level of 665.00.

### Trading plan for  **[ETHUSD][3] **today:

Buy 590.28, TP 665.00
