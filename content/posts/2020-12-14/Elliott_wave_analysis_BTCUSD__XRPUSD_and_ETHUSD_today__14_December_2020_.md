Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 14.12.2020Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I suggest entry signals
to trade each cryptocurrency.

The BTCUSD bullish trend should end at a level of about 20900.000. At
this level, the impulse wave (5) will be 100% of impulse (3) according
to Fibonacci retracement.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

 ****

There is now forming the final, fifth wave of the long-term impulse wave
C. Four out five sub-waves have completed within impulse [5]. The deep
correction (4) ended, and the cryptocurrency pair is rising in the sub-
wave (5). The price should be running up to a level of 20900.00. At this
level, the sub-waves (3) and (5) will be equal. Therefore, one could
enter long trades in the current situation.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 19309.500 TP 20900.000

* * *

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

 ****

The XRPUSD market must have completed the flat corrective wave [4] as a
part of the bullish impulse C. Correction [4] is a flat, its final wave
(c) is an ending diagonal. There is now forming the final wave [5]. The
market could be running up to a level above 0.625. It is relevant to buy
in the current situation.

### Trading plan for **[XRPUSD][2]** today:

Buy 0.512, TP 0.625

* * *

## Elliott wave Ethereum analysis

 ****

In the long-term impulse wave C, there is forming the final wave [5] as
a simple five-wave impulse. The long corrective wave (4) has completed
as a bearish triple zigzag. There is developing the beginning of wave
(5). The first sub-waves 1 and 2 have completed so far. Therefore, the
market should continue rising in the sub-waves 3-4-5 towards level
634.00, made by wave (3).

### Trading plan for  **[ETHUSD][3] **today:

Buy 590.45, TP 634.000
