Economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the week 02.08.2021 – 08.08.2021Jana Kane

##  **Review of the main events of the Forex economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the
next trading week (02.08.2021 – 08.08.2021)**

While the major US stock indices ended the last week mostly neutral, the
dollar fell. At the end of the trading day on Friday the DXY dollar
index was 1% below its opening price at the beginning of the week.

Last Wednesday, the Fed officials kept the current parameters of
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) unchanged, signaling the need to further support the
economy and continue stimulating measures. "Against the backdrop of
progress in vaccination of the population and strong government support
measures, indicators of economic activity and employment continue to
grow stronger. The sectors most affected by the pandemic have shown some
improvement, but have not yet fully recovered," the central bank said.

Still, we probably should not be expecting a stronger decline in the
dollar. One way or another, the US economy is recovering faster than
other major world economies, maybe except China.

At the same time, the growing inflation in the United States, which
shows the highest growth rates over the past almost 30 years, will
sooner or later force the Fed leaders to pay attention to this and still
start curtailing the stimulating [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). Most economists believe that
the Fed will start this process earlier than, for example, the ECB. And
this is one of the main reasons to give preference to the dollar.

It is also in demand as a defensive asset amid fears about the spread of
the coronavirus, and continued positive macro data from the US provide
additional support.

Next week, financial market participants will pay attention to the
publication of important macro statistics from Germany, the US, New
Zealand, Australia, the Eurozone, Canada, as well as the results of the
meetings of the central banks of Australia and the UK. However, the
focus of their attention will still be the publication on Friday of
monthly data from the US labor market.

 ***during the coming week, new events may be added to the [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) and
/ or some scheduled events may be canceled**

 ****GMT time**

###  **Monday, August 2**

###  **06:00 EUR Retail Sales in Germany**

Retail sales is the main indicator of consumer spending in Germany,
showing changes in retail sales. A high result strengthens the euro, and
vice versa, a low result weakens it. Forecast: +2% in June against +4.2%
(-2.4% y / y) in May, -2.0% (+4.4% y / y) in April, +7.7% ( +11% y / y)
in March, +1.2% (-9.0% y / y) in February, -4.5% (-8.7% y / y) in
January.

The data indicate the instability of the recovery of this sector of the
German economy due to lockdowns. Better-than-expected data is likely to
have a positive effect on the euro, but in the short term.

###  **14:00** **USD Manufacturing** **PMI (from ISM)**

Published by the Institute for Supply Management (ISM), the US
Manufacturing PMI is an important indicator of the health of the US
economy as a whole. A result above 50 is seen as positive and
strengthens the USD, one below 50 as negative for the US dollar.
Forecast: 60.8 in July (against 60.6 in June, 61.2 in May, 60.7 in
April, 64.7 in March, 60.8 in February, 58.7 in January, 60.7 in
December). The index is above the 50 level and has a relatively high
value, which is likely to support the dollar. The data above the value
of 50 indicates an acceleration of activity, which has a positive effect
on the quotes of the national currency. If the indicator falls below the
forecast and, especially, below the value of 50, the dollar may sharply
weaken in the short term.

###  **Tuesday, August 3**

###  **04:30 AUD RBA's decision on interest rate. RBA's accompanying
statement**

In March 2020, the RBA made 2 rate cuts, bringing it to the level of
0.25%, and launched a quantitative easing program. At the same time, for
the 3-year government bonds of Australia, the target level of yield is
set at 0.25%. The RBA has launched a lending program for the banking
system in the amount of at least A$ 90 billion.

In early November 2020, the RB of Australia lowered its key rate again,
bringing it and its 3-year bond target to 0.10% from 0.25%, and
announced A$ 100 billion quantitative easing program to support the
incipient economic recovery.

The main negative factors for the Australian economy are weak wages
growth, a weak labor market and a slowdown in growth. Annual inflation
has remained below the 2-3% target set by the RBA for four years.

Unemployment in the country has remained above the 5% level for many
years, unwilling to decline. Now the Australian economy is experiencing
difficulties due to the coronavirus pandemic, which has hit the tourism
and transport sectors hard.

It is expected that at this meeting the Central Bank of Australia will
leave the rate at the current level of 0.1%, although unexpected
decisions are not ruled out.

In an accompanying statement, the leaders of the RBA will explain the
reasons for the decision on the rate. If the RBA signals the possibility
of further easing of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) in the near future, the risks of a
fall in the Australian dollar will increase.

###  **22:45 NZD Employment rate. Unemployment rate (data for the 2nd
quarter)**

The employment rate reflects the quarterly change in the number of New
Zealand citizens employed. The growth of the indicator has a positive
impact on consumer spending, which stimulates economic growth. A high
value is positive for the NZD, while a low value is negative. Forecast:
In the 2nd quarter, the number of employed citizens of New Zealand
increased, and the employment rate increased by +0.7% (against an
increase of +0.6% in the 1st quarter of 2021 and in the 4th quarter of
2020, a decrease -0.8% in the 3rd quarter, an increase of +0.7% in the
1st quarter of 2020 and a fall of -0.4% in the 2nd quarter).

Also at the same time, the Bureau of Statistics of New Zealand publishes
a report on the unemployment rate - an indicator that estimates the
ratio of the unemployed population to the total number of able-bodied
citizens. The growth of the indicator indicates the weakness of the
labor market, which leads to a weakening of the national economy. The
decline in the indicator is a positive factor for the NZD. Forecast:
unemployment in New Zealand in the 2nd quarter was at the level of 4.5%
(against 4.7% in the 1st quarter of 2021, 4.9% in the 4th quarter of
2020, 5.3% in the 3rd Q2, 4.0% in Q2, 4.2% in Q1 2020).

If other indicators of the NZ Bureau of Statistics report deteriorate,
it is likely to negatively affect the NZD. Poorly forecast data will
have an even stronger negative impact on the NZD.

###  **Wednesday, August 4**

###  **01:30 AUD Retail Sales Index**

The Retail Sales Index is published monthly by the Australian Bureau of
Statistics and measures total retail sales. The index is often
considered an indicator of consumer confidence and reflects the health
of the retail sector in the near term. A rise in the index is usually
positive for the AUD; a decrease in the indicator will negatively affect
the AUD. The previous value of the index (for June) was -1.8%. If the
data turns out to be weaker than the previous value, the AUD may sharply
decline in the short term, but if it's above the previous values, the
AUD is likely to strengthen.

###  **09:00** **EUR Retail Sales in Eurozone**

Retail sales is a major consumer spending indicator that shows the
change in retail sales. A high result strengthens the euro, and vice
versa, a low result weakens it. Forecast for June: +1.9% (+8.2% yoy)
against +4.6% (+9.0% yoy) in May, -3.1% and +23.9% (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) in
March, +3.0% and -2.9% (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) in February, -5.9% and -6.4%
(in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) in January. The data suggests that, despite the rise
in indices, retail sales have not yet reached pre-coronavirus levels
after a sharp drop in March-April 2020, when strict quarantine measures
were in force in Europe. Nevertheless, better-than-expected data is
likely to have a positive effect on the euro.

###  **12:15 USD ADP National Employment Report**

Typically, ADP's private sector employment report has a strong impact on
the market and dollar quotes. An increase in the value of this indicator
has a positive effect on the dollar. The growth in the number of workers
in the US private sector in July is expected to be +721,000 (against an
increase of 692,000 in June, 978,000 in May, 742,000 in April, 517,000
in March, 117,000 in February, 174,000 in January, a drop of -123,000 in
December). The relative growth of the indicator may have a positive
effect on the dollar quotes, while the relative decline in the indicator
- negatively. Therefore, the market reaction may be negative, and the
dollar may decline if the data turns out to be worse than forecast.

Millions of Americans have previously been laid off due to the
coronavirus pandemic and related quarantine measures. The bulk of
layoffs were concentrated in tourism and retail. Other important sectors
of the economy were also affected. ADP previously reported that the most
significant drop in employment was recently observed in the construction
and financial services sectors.

Although the ADP report does not directly correlate with the official US
Labor Department data, which will be released on Friday, the ADP report
is often a harbinger of it, having a noticeable impact on the market.

###  **14:00 USD Services PMI (from ISM)**

This indicator assesses the state of the services sector in the US
economy. These services sectors (as opposed to the manufacturing sector)
have practically no impact on the country's GDP.

In June, this indicator came out with a value of 60.1. A result above 50
is seen as positive for the USD. However, a relative decline in the
index could negatively affect the dollar in the short term. Forecast for
July: 60.4, which is likely to have a positive overall effect on the
USD.

###  **Thursday, August 5**

###  **01:30 AUD Balance of Trade**

Balance of trade assesses the ratio between Australia's exports and
imports. Growth in exports from Australia leads to an increase in the
trade surplus, which has a positive impact on the AUD. Previous value A$
9.681 billion (May), A$ 8.028 billion (April), A$ 5.574 billion (March),
A$ 7.529 billion (February). A decrease in the trade surplus may
negatively affect the Australian dollar. Conversely, the growing trade
surplus is a positive factor for the AUD. Forecast for June: AU$ 10.450
billion.

###  **11:00 GBP Bank of England interest rate decision. Minutes of the
meeting of the Bank of England. Planned volume of asset purchases by the
Bank of England. Monetary Policy Report**

In March (11 March and 19 March) 2020, during its extraordinary
meetings, the Bank of England cut its interest rate twice, bringing it
to the level of 0.1%, and announced its intention to purchase UK
government bonds in the amount of 200 billion British pounds, trying to
counteract economic damage from the coronavirus pandemic. The central
bank announced an increase in its bond portfolio to £645bn, then to
£745bn and to £895bn from £445bn at the time. "The current situation is
completely unprecedented," said Governor of the Bank of England Andrew
Bailey during a press conference after an emergency meeting on March 19.
Bailey said he expects a sharp economic contraction due to the
coronavirus, and the Bank of England is ready to take further stimulus
measures if necessary. “No, we are not done yet,” he said. Based on
these statements by Andrew Bailey, it is fair to expect further actions
from the Bank of England towards easing its monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). It is
possible that at this meeting the Bank of England will again undertake
them, increasing the volume of purchases of bonds or lowering the
interest rate. Although most economists believe that the Bank of England
will refrain from these actions for now.

Also at this time, the minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of
the Bank of England are published with the distribution of votes "for"
and "against" raising / lowering the interest rate. The main risks for
the UK after Brexit are associated with expectations of a slowdown in
the country's economic growth, as well as with a large current account
deficit in the UK balance of payments.

The intrigue about the further actions of the Bank of England remains.
Both in the pound and the FTSE100 index, a lot of trading opportunities
are provided during the period of publication of the bank's decision on
rates.

Also at the same time, the Bank of England's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) report will
be published, containing an assessment of the economic outlook and
inflation. At this time, the volatility in the pound quotes may rise
sharply. Apart from GDP, one of the main benchmarks for the Bank of
England regarding the prospects for monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) in the UK, is the
inflation rate. If the tone of the report is soft, then the British
stock market will receive support and the pound will decline.
Conversely, the report's tough rhetoric on curbing inflation, implying
an increase in interest rates in the UK, will strengthen the pound.

###  **11:30 GBP** Speech by head of the Bank of England Andrew Bailey

Financial market participants expect Andrew Bailey to clarify the
situation regarding the further [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the UK central bank.
Volatility during the speech of the head of the Bank of England usually
rises sharply in the quotes of the pound and the London Stock Exchange
FTSE index, if he gives any hints of tightening or easing of the Bank of
England's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). Probably, Andrew Bailey will also give
explanations regarding the decision made by the Bank of England on the
interest rate and will touch upon the state and prospects of the British
economy after Brexit and the partial lifting of quarantine restrictions
due to the coronavirus. If Bailey does not touch on monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
issues, the reaction to his speech will be weak.

###  **23:00 AUD Speech by the head of the RBA Philip Lowe**

In his speech, Philip Lowe will assess the current situation in the
Australian economy and point out further plans for the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
of the department.

Market participants would also like to hear Lowe's views on central bank
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and Australia's first
recession in 30 years. According to Lowe, "there are no serious
arguments in favor of tightening monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) in the short term," and
"it will be some time before interest rates rise."

Any signals from him regarding a change in the plans of the RBA's
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) will cause a sharp increase in volatility in the AUD and
the Australian stock market. If he does not touch on the topic of
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), the market reaction to his speech will be weak.

###  **Friday, August 6**

###  **01:30 AUD RBA's statement on monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)**

The Statement on Monetary Policy provides an overview of economic and
financial conditions and an assessment of risks to financial stability
and sustainable economic growth. The statement is a kind of guideline
for defining the RBA's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) plans. A tougher stance on the
RBA's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) is seen as positive and strengthens the Australian
dollar, while a more cautious stance is seen as negative for the AUD.

###  **12:30 USD Average hourly wages. Non-farm payrolls. Unemployment
rate**

The most important indicators of the state of the labor market in the
United States for July. Forecast: +0.3% (against + 0.3% in June, +0.5%
in May, +0.7% in April, -0.1% in March, +0.2% in January and February ,
+0.8% in December, +0.3% in November) / +0.900 million (against +0.850
million in June, +0.559 million in May, +0.266 million in April, +0.916
million in March, +0.379 in February, +0.049 million in January, -0.140
million in December, +0.245 million in November, +0.638 million in
October, +1.763 million in July and -20.687 million in April 2020) /
5.7% (against 5.9 % in June, 5.8% in May, 6.1% in April, 6.0% in March,
6.2% in February, 6.3% in January, 6.7% in December and November, 6.9%
in October, 13.3% in May and 14.7% in April 2020), respectively.

In general, the indicators can be described as encouraging. The data
speaks of continued improvement in the US labor market after plummeting
in the first half of 2020. Prior to the coronavirus, the US labor market
remained strong, signaling the stability of the American economy and
supporting dollar quotes.

It is often difficult to predict the market reaction to the publication
of indicators, because many indicators for previous periods are subject
to revision. Now it will be even more difficult to do this, because the
economic situation in the United States and many other large economies
remains controversial due to the coronavirus. In any case, when data
from the US labor market is published, a surge in volatility is expected
in trading not only in USD, but throughout the entire financial market.
The most cautious [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s might choose to stay out of the market
during this timeframe.

###  **12:30 CAD** Unemployment rate in Canada

Statistics Canada is to publish data on the country's labor market for
July. Unemployment has risen in Canada in recent months amid massive
business closures due to coronavirus and layoffs. Unemployment rose from
the usual 5.6% - 5.7% to 7.8% in March and already up to 13.7% in May
2020. If unemployment continues to rise, the Canadian dollar will
decline. If the data turn out to be better than the previous value, the
Canadian dollar will strengthen. A decrease in the unemployment rate is
a positive factor for the CAD, an increase in unemployment is a negative
factor. Unemployment is expected to be 7.7% in July (against 7.8% in
June, 8.2% in May, 8.1% in April, 7.5% in March, 8.2% in February, 9.4%
in January, 8.8% in December, 8.6% in November).
