Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 13.09.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

The short-term oil uptrend continues. Its target is to test the
September 2 high.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

The short-term oil uptrend continues. Its target is to test the
September 2 high, which is level 70.33. If this level is broken out in
the future, the next target for purchases will be Target Zone 2 72.85 -
72.32.

If level 70.33 is held by the market, then a second correction will
begin with the target in the zone of 67.87 - 67.17.

Today, it is reasonable to set a take profit for purchases entered in
the Intermediary Zone 67.87 - 67.62 around level 70.33 and wait for a
reaction to the resistance level.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

Hold up purchases entered in the zone of 67.87 - 67.17. TakeProfit:
70.33. StopLoss: at the breakeven.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

On Monday morning, gold is trading in a short-term downtrend, the main
target of which is to break out the Target Zone 1792 - 1788. If the
Target Zone is broken out, the next sales target will be the Gold Zone
1772 - 1770. In this case, rearrange the resistance zones and look again
for sales.

If the level of 1787 is held by buyers during today's trading session,
then there will be a possibility of buying the gold up to the
Intermediary Zone 1805 - 1803. In this case, look at the traders'
reaction to the retest of resistance.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

Watch the market.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

EURUSD bears have a great opportunity to consolidate below the
Intermediary Zone 1.1820 - 1.1812 and reverse the short-term trend down.
If this happens, it will be possible to sell the euro with the target in
the Target Zone 1.1733 - 1.1715.

If today at the US trading session, the price returns to the support
level of 1.1820, then the short-term uptrend will continue. Therefore,
the euro purchases with a target in the zone of ​​the September 3 high
will be relevant. For purchases, a formation of a pattern is needed. For
example, a “false breakout” after breaking out level 1.1847.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

Buy according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 1.1820 - 1.1812.
TakeProfit: 1.1905. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.
