Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 13.09.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

All three cryptocurrency pairs are forming bearish impulse sub-waves.
The prices should continue falling.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

The BTCUSD market is forming the inceptive part of the new bearish wave
as an impulse. So far, sub-waves 1 and 2, have completed as an impulse
and a correction, which is a double three [W]-[X]-[Y]. There is
developing the initial part of the bearish impulse 3. Sub-waves [1] and
[2] have completed, and the remaining three sub-waves should be
developing, driving the price to a level below 41800.00, marked by wave
1.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Sell 44643.76, TP 41800.00

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

There is forming the initial part of the descending wave, which could be
unfolding as an impulse. Sub-waves 1 and 2 must have completed. Sub-wave
1 is a bearish impulse. Sub-wave 2 is a correction completed as a double
zigzag [W]-[X]-[Y]. The market should be declining in impulse 3. The
first two parts of impulse 3, sub-waves [1]-[2], must have completed.
Therefore, the remaining three sub-waves should be forming. The price
should go down to a level below 0.950, marked by sub-wave 1.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] **** today:

Sell 1.068, TP 0.950

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

The ETHUSD market is also forming a new down wave as an impulse. Sub-
waves 1 and 2 have completed, and there is forming sub-wave 3. The first
two legs of impulse 3 have competed so far, sub-waves [1] and [2].
Therefore, the market should be going down in impulse 3 to a level below
2895.00, marked by wave 1.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Sell 3267.31, TP 2895.00
