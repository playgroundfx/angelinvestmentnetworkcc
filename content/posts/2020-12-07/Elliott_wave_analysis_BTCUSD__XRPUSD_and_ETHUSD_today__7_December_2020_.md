Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 07.12.2020Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I suggest entry signals
to trade each cryptocurrency.

The cryptocurrency market is trading flat. Let us explore the chart of
each cryptocurrency pair in more detail.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

 ****

The BTCUSD market is forming the final wave of the global bullish
zigzag, the C wave that the unfolding as a simple five-wave impulse. The
first four legs, the sub-waves [1]-[2]-[3]-[4] have finished within the
C wave. There is developing the impulse wave [5]. The flat correction
(4) must be developing as a contracting triangle. Wave d should soon
finish, and the market could be declining in wave e to a level of
18863.98. The target is at the support line drawn across the peaks of
waves a and c.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Sell 19240.62. TP 18863.98

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

 ****

The XRPUSD market is growing in the upward impulse wave C that could
conclude the large zigzag (Y). After the powerful impulse wave [3]
finished, the market has been following the sideways correction [4] that
is unfolding as a triangle. The zigzag-shaped sub-wave (D) should end
soon. Next, the price could be declining in the final wave (e) to a
level of 0.568, a support level. One could enter sell trades in the
current situation.

## Elliott wave Ethereum analysis

 ****

The ETHUSD market is forming the upward wave (Y) as a zigzag. The final
wave C of the (Y) zigzag is forming as an impulse. The first four legs
have completed within the C impulse, and the final wave [5] is still
forming. There should be developing the sideways corrective wave (4).
Wave (4) has a complex structure and is unfolding as a triple three
w-x-y-xx-z. After a short rise, the market will conclude the linking
wave xx. Next, the price will be declining to a level of 562.20. It is
relevant to enter sell positions in the current situation.
