Economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the week 25.01.2021 – 31.01.2021Jana Kane

##  **Review of the main events of the Forex economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the
next trading week (25.01.2021 – 31.01.2021)**

 **Trading on key Forex [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/): next week we are expecting the publication
of important macro statistics from the UK, Australia, US, Germany, as
well as the results of the Fed meeting on monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) issues.**

The dollar dropped last week and the major American stock indexes
finished it with a decent gain despite the decline at the end of the
week. The NASDAQ100 index rose by 4.5% last week, and  S&P 500 - by 2%.

Investors are generally optimistic and stocks are looking for further
gains, given the position of the world's largest central banks,
including the Fed and the US government, to further support the economy
amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. Expectations of a successful
vaccination and an early victory over the virus also help maintain
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) optimism and put pressure on a safe dollar.

Market participants also suggest that in the near future, the White
House may announce new additional measures after the adoption of the
$1.9 trillion bailout program.

Next week, financial market participants will pay attention to the
publication of important macro statistics from the UK, Australia, US,
Germany, however, their focus will be on the Fed meeting and the
publication of its decision on rates.

 **Traders should pay attention to the publication of the following
macro indicators:**

 ***during the coming week, new events may be added to the [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) and
/ or some scheduled events may be canceled**

###  **23:50 JPY Bank of Japan Monetary Policy Committee Meeting**

As a result of the meeting last week, the Bank of Japan decided to keep
the key interest rate at -0.1%. The target level of yield on 10-year
government bonds was also left unchanged at zero. The Central Bank also
decided to extend the financing program for one year. "It is still too
early to discuss winding down the massive monetary stimulus program,"
said the Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda during a press
conference that followed, adding traditionally that the bank's
management "would not hesitate to soften [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) again if necessary." At
this meeting, the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Japan will
once again summarize the results of the last week's meeting of the Bank,
analyze the economic situation in Japan and give indications on possible
further prospects for the Bank of Japan's financial [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). If the tone
of the minutes of the meeting indicates the firmness of the intentions
of the Bank of Japan regarding monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) in the country, it will
negatively affect the Japanese stock market and strengthen the yen.
Conversely, mild rhetoric about the bank's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) prospects
will help weaken the yen and boost the Japanese stock market.

###  **07:00 GBP Report on the average wages of British citizens for the
last 3 months. Unemployment rate**

On a monthly basis, the UK Office for National Statistics (ONS)
publishes a report on the average wages covering the last 3 months, with
and without bonuses.

This report is a key short-term indicator of the dynamics of changes in
the level of wages of employees in the UK. Earnings growth is positive
for the GBP, while a low value is negative. Forecast: January report
suggests that average wages with bonuses increased over the last
calculated 3 months (September-November) by +2.8% (against +2.7%, +1.3%,
+0.1% , -1.0%, -1.2%, -0.3%, +1.0%, +2.4%, +2.8%, +3.1%, +2.9%, +3.2%,
+3.2% in previous periods); without bonuses - increased by +2.6%
(against +2.8%, +1.9%, +0.9%, +0.2%, -0.2%, +0.7%, +1.7%, +2.7%, +2.9%,
+3.1%, +3.2%, +3.4%, +3.5% in previous periods). The expected data is
still below average. If the data turns out to be better than forecast,
the pound is likely to strengthen in the foreign exchange market in the
short term. The data worse than the forecast will negatively affect the
pound.

Also at this time, the office publishes data on unemployment in the UK.
It is expected that in the 3 months from September to November,
unemployment was at 5.1% (against 4.9%, 4.8%, 4.5%, 4.3%, 3.9%, 3.9%,
3.9%, 3.9%, 4.0%, 3.9% and 3.8% in previous periods). Since 2012, the UK
unemployment rate has declined steadily (from 8.0% in September 2012).
This is a positive factor for the pound, while unemployment growth is a
negative factor.

If the data from the UK labor market turn out to be worse than the
forecast and / or the previous value, the pound will be under pressure.

In any case, at the time of the publication of data from the British
labor market, an increase in volatility in the pound quotes and on the
London Stock Exchange is expected.

###  **00:30 AUD RBA core inflation index using the trimmed mean method
(for the 4th quarter). Consumer Price Index (Q4)**

This indicator is published by the RBA and the Australian Bureau of
Statistics. It reflects the dynamics of retail prices of goods and
services included in the consumer basket. The trimmed mean method takes
into account the weighted average kernel, the central 70% of the index
components. Previous index values: +0.4% (+0.7% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)), -0.1%
(+1.2% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) in the 2nd quarter, +0.5% (+1.8% YoY) in Q1
2020. According to the forecast, the indicator for the 4th quarter of
2020 is expected to be +0.4% (+1.2% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)). If the value of
the indicator coincides with the forecast or turns out to be worse than
it, it is likely to negatively affect the AUD. The data indicate low
inflationary pressures in the country. The growth of the indicator
should have a positive effect on the AUD in the short term.

The Consumer Price Inflation Index (CPI) published by the RBA and the
Australian Bureau of Statistics measures the dynamics of retail prices
for goods and services in Australia. CPI is the most significant
indicator of inflation and changes in consumer preferences. A high
reading is positive for the AUD, while a low reading is negative.
Previous values ​​of the indicator: +1.6% (0.7% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)), -1.9%
(-0.3% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) in the 2nd quarter, +0.3% (+2.2 % in annual
[terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) in the 1st quarter of 2020. According to the forecast, it is
expected that the value of the indicator for the 4th quarter of 2020
will be +0.7% (+0.7% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)). The expected positive reading is
likely to also have a positive effect on the AUD. If the value of the
indicator turns out to be worse than the forecast, it is likely to put
pressure on the AUD.

###  **13:30 USD Durable goods orders. Capital goods orders (ex defense
and aviation)**

This indicator reflects the value of orders received by manufacturers of
durable goods and capital goods (capital goods are durable commodities
used to produce durable goods and services) involving large investments.
Commodities produced in the defense and aviation sectors of the US
economy are not included in this indicator. A strong result strengthens
the USD. Previous values ​​of the indicator “orders for durable goods”:
+1.0% in November, +1.9% in September, +0.5% in August, +11.7% in July,
+7.7% in June , +15.0% in May, -18.3% in April, -16.7% in March, +2.0%
in February, -0.2% in January.

Previous values ​​of the indicator "orders for capital goods excluding
defense and aviation": +0.5% in November, +1.0% in September, +1.9% in
August, +2.5% in July, +4.3% in June, +1.5% in May, -6.6% in April,
-1.3% in March, -0.6% in February, +0.9% in January.

In theory, the relative growth of the indicator has a positive effect on
the dollar; the market reaction to its negative value may be negative
for the dollar in the short term. Data worse than the previous value
will also negatively affect the dollar quotes.

Forecast for December: +1.0% (orders for durable goods), +0.4% (orders
for capital goods excluding defense and aviation).

It looks like the growth of indicators has stalled again after their
recovery in previous months from a strong drop in March and April, which
may negatively affect the dollar quotes. The slightly better-than-
expected data is also unlikely to have a long-term positive impact on
the dollar.

###  **19:00 USD The Fed's decision on interest rate. The Fed's comments
on monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). FOMC Press Conference**

Following two meetings in March, the Fed sharply cut its interest rate
(to 0.25% from 1.75% in February), and also announced the allocation of
$700 billion for the purchase of US government bonds and mortgage-backed
securities. Subsequently, the Fed has repeatedly announced additional
measures to support the US economy and inject cheap liquidity into the
financial system. Usually, with the easing of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), the
national currency becomes cheaper and its quotations go down.

In recent months, the dollar has been declining as [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s withdrew
funds from defensive assets, buying more risky and profitable assets of
the stock market, which continued to grow despite the threat of a second
wave of the coronavirus epidemic and the associated economic slowdown.
The role of the dollar as a defensive asset was also declining.

The rate is widely expected to remain at 0.25% at this meeting.
Nevertheless, during the period of publication of the decision on the
rate, volatility may sharply grow throughout the financial market,
primarily in the American stock market and in the dollar quotes,
especially if the decision on the rate differs from the forecast or the
Fed leaders make unexpected statements.

Powell's comments may affect both short-term and long-term USD trading.
A more hawkish stance on the Fed's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) is seen as positive
and strengthening the US dollar, while a more cautious position is seen
as negative for the USD. Investors are eager to hear Powell's views on
the Fed's future plans for this year.

The press conference of the US Federal Open Market Committee lasts about
an hour. The first part includes the reading of the the ruling, followed
by a series of questions and answers that can increase market
volatility. Any hints by Powell about the possibility of a change in the
current monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) will cause an increase in volatility in the
dollar quotes and in the American stock market.

###  **13:00 EUR Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) in Germany
(preliminary release)**

This index is published by the EU Statistics Office and is calculated on
the basis of a statistical method agreed between all EU countries. It is
an indicator for assessing inflation and is used by the Governing
Council of the ECB to assess the level of price stability. A positive
result strengthens the EUR, a negative one weakens it.

In May, the HICP index (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) increased by +0.5%, in June by
+0.8%, in July - by 0%, in December it decreased by -0.7%. Preliminary
forecast for January: +0.5%. If the data turn out to be better than the
forecast, the euro may strengthen in the short term. The growth of the
indicator is a positive factor for the euro. The data indicate that
inflationary pressures are still low in Germany. The data is worse than
the forecast and the previous value will negatively affect the euro.

###  **13:30 USD Annual GDP of the US for the 4th quarter (preliminary
estimate)**

GDP data is one of the key indicators (along with data on the labor
market and inflation) for the Fed in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of its monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).
Strong result strengthens US dollar; weak GDP report negatively affects
the US dollar. In the previous 3rd quarter, GDP grew by +33.4% after
falling by -31.4% in the 2nd quarter and by -5.0% in the 1st quarter of
2020.

If the data point to another decline in GDP in the 4th quarter, the
dollar will be under pressure. The positive data on GDP will support the
dollar and the American stock indices, although they are already mostly
priced in. Preliminary forecast for Q4 2020: +3.9%.

###  **Friday, January 29**

###  **09:00 EUR Germany's GDP for the 4th quarter (preliminary
release)**

GDP is considered the most important indicator of the overall health of
the economy. The growing trend in the GDP indicator is considered
positive for the national currency. The German economy is the locomotive
of the entire European economy. A high value of GDP is considered a
positive factor for the EUR, while a low one is considered negative.

The growth of the European and German economies slowed sharply in 2019,
and in 2020 the European economy has already entered a recession
according to many indicators. Although the Brexit problem is finally
resolved, the risk of negative impact on the economy of the consequences
of the coronavirus pandemic has been added to the internal political
risks in Europe.

If the GDP data turn out to be weaker than the forecast, it will put
downward pressure on the euro. Better-than-expected data may strengthen
the euro.

Forecast: German GDP grew by +8.5% in the 4th quarter of 2020.
