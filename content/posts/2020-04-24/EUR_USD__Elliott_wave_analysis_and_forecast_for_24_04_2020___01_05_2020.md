EUR/USD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 24/04/2020 –
01/05/2020Alex Geuta

## [EUR/USD][1] remains likely to fall. Estimated pivot point is at a
level of 1.0990.

 **Main scenario:** Consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 1.0990 with a target of 1.0528 – 1.0414.

 **Alternative scenario:** ****breakout and consolidation above the
level of 1.0990 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of
1.1150 – 1.1496.

 **Analysis:** Supposedly, the descending fifth wave of larger degree
(5) of С continues developing on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame, with the first
wave 1 of (5) formed inside. On the 4-hour time frame, a local
correction finished developing in the form of wave 2 of (5) and wave 3
of (5) started forming. Apparently, wave iii of 3 is developing on the
H1 time frame, with wave (iii) of iii of smaller degree forming inside.
If the presumption is correct, the pair will continue to drop to the
levels of 1.0528 – 1.0414. The level of 1.0990 is critical in this
scenario. Its breakout will allow the pair to continue rising to the
levels of 1.1150 – 1.1496.
