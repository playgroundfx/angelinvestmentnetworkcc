Dollar divides and rulesDmitri Demidenko

## A lack of consensus on funding the financial aid programs in the euro
area weighs on the EUR/USD

Danger always looks bigger through the eyes of fear. Many international
banks and investment companies see a gloomy long-term outlook for the US
dollar because of two reasons. First, the huge fiscal stimulus will
widen the budget deficit and the US public debt, which will worsen the
financial state and increase the risks of a new crisis. Second, the
unprecedented monetary expansion will boost the Fed’s balance sheet, and
the excessive money supply usually leads to the money devaluing.
However, the real experience has many times proved many theories to be
wrong. Can this be the case now?

Yes, The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget expects the US
budget deficit to reach $3.8 trillion (18.6% of GDP) this year, and the
public debt will total 107% of GDP (up from the previous forecast of
86%), however, the projections for the debt service costs are the same.
This is about 2% of GDP, which is associated with the Treasury rates
drop. It means that the debt should not do much harm. As overseas
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s' demand for Treasuries is high, the USA can afford to have
more debts.

The decisions are taken quickly in the USA, unlike in the euro-area.
European Union leaders agreed to create the emergency aid fund of €1
trillion, but [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s do not understand what are the sources of
funding it. The growth of the 3-month LIBOR rate, the average interbank
interest rate at which European banks are prepared to lend one another
unsecured funds, and its spread with the corresponding overnight
interest swap rate that tracks the ECB interest rates, to its 4-year
high signals higher risks of the euro-area financial fragmentation. The
euro-area countries have different costs to manage the pandemic impact.
Unless there is a clear agreement on [how to](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-trading-how-to/) fund the costs, the chance
of the euro-area breakup will increase.

Besides, the current recession should be deeper in the euro area than in
the USA, which is signaled by the drop of the PMIs to all-time lows. The
US composite PMI is down to 27.4, which is the lowest value since
October 2009. The euro-area PMI is down to 13.4, by far its lowest
reading since the survey began in 1998.

Everyone knows about the growth of the Fed’s balance sheet. The ECB,
however, may surprise the markets by boosting the QE pace by at least
€500 billion already in late April. This is the opinion of 27% of the
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The majority believes the monetary
stimulus should be increased in September. The emergency bond-buying
program will hardly end before March 2021.

Time will show who is right. Both the bears and the bulls on the
[EUR/USD][4] have their arguments, and the market conditions, constantly
changing, could affect their positions. The euro is still under pressure
due to the disputes among European officials. If the euro doesn’t move
above $1.08-$1.081 in the next few days, it can head for $1.065.
