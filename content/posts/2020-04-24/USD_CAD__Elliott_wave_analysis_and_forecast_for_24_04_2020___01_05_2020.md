USD/CAD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 24/04/2020 –
01/05/2020Alex Geuta

## [USD/CAD][1] remains likely to fall. Estimated pivot point is at a
level of 1.4264.

 **Main scenario:** Consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 1.4264 with a target of 1.3788 – 1.3598.

 **Alternative scenario:** ****breakout and consolidation above the
level of 1.4264 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of
1.4350 – 1.4562.

 **Analysis:** On the D1 time frame, supposedly, a descending correction
finished developing in the form of second wave of larger degree (2), and
wave (3) started forming. Supposedly, the first counter-trend wave of
smaller degree 1 of (3) formed and a descending correction is developing
in the form of wave 2 of (3) on the H4 time frame. On the H1 time-frame,
apparently, wave a of 2 formed, wave b of 2 finished developing and wave
c of 2 started forming. If the presumption is correct, the pair will
continue to drop to the levels of 1.3788 – 1.3598. The level of 1.4264
is critical in this scenario as the breakout will enable the pair to
continue rising to the levels of 1.4350 – 1.4562.
