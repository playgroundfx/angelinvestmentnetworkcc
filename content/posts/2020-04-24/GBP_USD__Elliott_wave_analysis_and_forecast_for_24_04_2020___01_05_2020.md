GBP/USD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 24/04/2020 –
01/05/2020Alex Geuta

## The pair [GBP/USD][1] remains likely to fall. Estimated pivot point
is at a level of 1.2652

 **Main scenario:** Consider short positions below the level of 1.2652
with a target of 1.1396 – 1.1177.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
1.2652 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 1.3201 –
1.3509.

 **Analysis:** Supposedly, the fifth wave of larger degree V continues
developing on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame, with a correction completed in the
form of wave (2) of V inside. The third wave (3) of V is developing on
the H4 time frame, with wave 3 of (3) formed and a correction developed
as wave 4 of (3) inside. Apparently, the fifth wave 5 of (3) has started
developing on the H1 time frame, with the first wave i of 5 forming
inside. If the presumption is correct, the pair will continue to drop to
the levels of 1.1396 – 1.1177. The level of 1.2652 is critical in this
scenario as the breakout will enable the pair to continue rising to the
levels of 1.3201 – 1.3509.
