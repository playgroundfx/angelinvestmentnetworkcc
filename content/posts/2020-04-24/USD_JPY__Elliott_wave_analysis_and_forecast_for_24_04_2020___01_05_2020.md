USD/JPY: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 24/04/2020 –
01/05/2020Alex Geuta

## [USD/JPY][1] remains likely to fall. Estimated pivot point is at a
level of 109.32.

 **Main scenario:** consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 109.32 with a target of 103.00 – 101.08.

 **Alternative scenario:** ****breakout and consolidation above the
level of 109.32 will allow the pair to continue the rise up to the
levels of 111.80 – 114.53.

 **Analysis:** On the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame, supposedly, a big horizontal
correction finished forming as a triangle-shaped wave (В) of B. On the
H4 time frame, wave (С) of B started developing, with the first wave  i
of 1 of (C) formed  and a local correction completed in the form of wave
ii of 1 of (C) inside. Apparently, the third wave iii of 1 of (C) is
developing on the H1 time frame.  If this assumption is correct, the
pair will continue to drop to 103.00 – 101.08. The level of 109.32 is
critical in this scenario as the breakout will enable the pair to
continue growing to the levels of 111.80 – 114.53.
