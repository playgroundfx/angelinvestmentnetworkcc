Pound develops immunity. Forecast as of 20.01.2021Dmitri Demidenko

Britain is one of the countries most affected by COVID-19, so its desire
to vaccinate the population and develop herd immunity as soon as
possible is understandable. How will this affect [GBPUSD][1] and
[EURGBP][2]? Let us discuss this topic and make up a trading plan

## Monthly pound fundamental forecast

At the moment, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s should pay maximum attention to the vaccination
process. Lifting of lockdowns, the speed of economic recovery, and
central banks' readiness to move towards normalization of monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) depend on the success of the vaccination campaign. In this
respect, the success of the pound looks more than logical. The UK has
got down to business, which cannot but inspire [GBPUSD][1] bulls and
[EURGBP][2] bears.

You can't say that Britain is ahead of the rest of the world.
Vaccination rates in Israel, Saudi Arabia, and Bahrain are impressive,
but the country is second to none in Europe. In late December, 5.9% of
the UK population was vaccinated. For comparison, in Denmark - the best
continental country in Europe in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of vaccination rates, this figure
was 2.8%. London is not stingy with spending money (the UK government
has spent £280 billion to combat the pandemic, including £11.7 billion
to the purchase, manufacture, and deployment of Covid-19 vaccines) and
intends to increase the number of vaccinations to 15 million by mid-
February. By the beginning of May, about 60% of the population will be
inoculated, which is quite enough to develop herd immunity.

### UK vaccination rate

Immunity is developed not only by the UK's residents but also by the
economy. In November, it sank 2.6% M-o-M, while Bloomberg experts
forecast -4.6%. A second lockdown was introduced in the UK in early
November, but a double-dip recession in the fourth quarter was most
likely avoided due to the manufacturing sector. For the worst-case
scenario to come true, in December, the GDP should drop by 1%, which is
unlikely in the context of a partial opening of the economy.

### UK GDP dynamics

As a result, GDP forecasts for 2020-2021 are improving, which reduces
the likelihood of introducing negative interest rates by the Bank of
England and contributes to strengthening the pound against major world
currencies. What's more, BoE chief economist Andy Haldane believes that
vaccination successes will boost the UK economy in the second quarter.
As a result, according to the expert, more than 1 million people who
lost their jobs due to the pandemic and recession will be able to return
to the labor market.

In my opinion, if the European Union doesn’t accelerate the vaccination
process, the [EURGBP][2] downward movement in the direction of
0.875-0.88 risks continuing. The EU, with a population of 450 million,
is facing criticism because the authorities ordered only 300 million
doses of Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. This will be enough to vaccinate 150
million people by the autumn. According to critics, it was necessary to
buy ten times more vaccines, spending €20-30 billion - an insignificant
amount compared to the cost of European lockdown.

As for the [GBPUSD][1], the [strategy][3] of buying the pair on
pullbacks with targets in the zone of 1.40-1.42 is still an excellent
option. I see no reason to refuse it. Continue to use corrections to
open the pound long positions.
