Dollar listens to a teacher. Forecast as of 20.01.2021Dmitri Demidenko

Yellen’s speech in the US Congress met [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s' expectations. Stock
bulls hope for an additional fiscal stimulus, and dollar bears believe
the Treasury will not interfere. Where will the EURUSD go? Let us
discuss the Forex outlook and make up a [EURUSD][1] trading plan.

##  **Monthly US dollar fundamental forecast**

When the verdict is not as strict as expected, you feel relief. Markets
expected Janet Yellen to voice her adherence to a strong dollar [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).
However, Yellen says the US doesn’t seek a weaker dollar to gain a
competitive advantage. The [EURUSD][1] bears are discouraged as the
Treasury secretary nominee says the Treasury should oppose attempts by
other countries to manipulate currency values artificially. Will the ECB
resort to verbal interventions after that?

Markets must have missed the rural teacher. This is how [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s once
called Janet Yellen for her ability to sort things out. Yellen satisfied
the market with her speech in Congress. US stocks bulls hope for an
additional fiscal stimulus of $1.9 trillion; US dollar bears believe
that the Treasury won’t oppose the dollar weakening, suggesting the
value of the US dollar should be determined by markets. At the same
time, Yellen expressed her opposition to the euro weakening.

If the European Central Bank wants to press the [EURUSD][1] down, it
should outplay the Fed. Yes, Christine Lagarde and her fellow central
bankers were aggressive during the recession, but they were hardly more
aggressive than the Fed. The Governing Council can’t affect foreign
exchange rates now. The QE expansion won’t accelerate inflation and will
face serious opposition from the hawks. The transition to a yield
targeting [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) will strengthen the euro by reducing the volume of
asset purchases. By the way, according to the Bloomberg source familiar
with the matter, the ECB is already doing something similar, narrowing
the yield spreads between the euro-area government bonds. Christine
Lagarde will not dare to speak about it aloud. There are the Japanese
and Australian experiences with the subsequent growth of the yen and
"Aussie" rates.

yields**

As long as most [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s expect the dollar to weaken, the ECB's failure
to cut European bond yields suggests the euro should be growing in
value. There is another problem. The [EURUSD][1] bulls bet on entirely
different conditions.

Remember, the bullish euro projections for 2021 were based on the
expected victory over the pandemic, exit from the lockdowns, and a rapid
rebound of the euro-area economy. However, the vaccination progresses
extremely slowly in Europe. About 4% of people received the vaccination
in the US, while about 1% of people were inoculated in Germany.

### Monthly [EURUSD][1] trading plan

The lockdown in the euro area could last longer than expected. If so,
the euro-area GDP recovery won’t be that fast, and the [EURUSD][1] won’t
reach level 1.25 soon. Of course, the rally might continue amid the
euphoria about the pair consolidation above 1.208, followed by a
successful test of the resistance at 1.215. However, I believe the euro-
dollar should enter a short-term consolidation range of 1.208-1.238. If
the bulls fail to break out the resistance at 1.215, the consolidation
range will move lower.
