Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 20.01.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

The BTCUSD market must be unfolding a corrective wave as a triangle.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

The BTCUSD market continues forming the upward impulse wave [5], namely
its final leg. Corrective wave 4 could still be developing in impulse
(5). Wave 4 must be unfolding as a contracting horizontal triangle
[a]-[b]-[c]-[d]-[e]. The final wave of the triangle, wave [e], should
end soon. Next, the market will continue rising in wave 5 to a level of
above 42000.00. This level is marked by impulse wave 3.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 34973.25 TP 42000.00

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

The XRPUSD market is forming a new bullish trend. There is developing
the beginning of the upward impulse wave. Corrective wave 4 is
developing as a double zigzag [W]-[X]-[Y]within wave (1). Linking wave
[X] is an extended wave unfolding as a triple zigzag. Correction 4
should soon end, and the price could start rising in wave 5 to a level
above the high marked by wave 3, that is, above level 0.380.

### Trading plan for **[XRPUSD][2]** today:

Buy 0.284, TP 0.380

## Elliott wave Ethereum analysis

There is forming the impulse wave C, with the final impulse 5 of (5)
developing inside. Four legs out of five have completed in impulse 5.
The market is currently rising in sub-wave [5]. The Ethereum price
should continue rising to a level of 1520.00. Next, the market could
turn down and start declining a new downtrend. One could enter long
trades in the current situation.

### Trading plan for  **[ETHUSD][3] **today:

Buy 1355.79, TP 1520.00
