Economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the week 05.04.2021 – 11.04.2021Jana Kane

##  **Review of the main events of the Forex economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the
next trading week (05.04.2021 – 11.04.2021)**

 **Trading on key Forex [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/): we are expecting the publication of
important macro statistics from the US, China, Canada, as well as the
results of the meeting of the Central Bank of Australia.**

Despite the strong report of the US Department of Labor published last
Friday, it was unable to provide significant support to the dollar. The
US economy created 916,000 new nonfarm jobs in March, above the 647,000
forecast, while unemployment fell from 6.2% to 6.0%. The Labor
Department data signal a strong economic recovery, suggesting that the
pace of hiring has accelerated and peaked since last August. “In the
first two months of our presidency, we have seen more jobs created than
at any other time in [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/),” US President Joe Biden was quick to say
after the publication of this report. According to Biden, a new
"infrastructure plan is needed for long-term growth." "If we accept this
plan, 19 million jobs will be created in the economy," Biden said,
promising to begin "meetings with members of Congress after Easter."

The DXY dollar index ended the last shortened week (at the end of which
the Catholic world celebrated Good Friday) with another increase,
setting a new 21-week record at around 93.47, the highest level since
the beginning of this year.

The dollar remains stable after the Fed meeting in mid-March. Loose
funding conditions, together with accelerating vaccinations in the
United States, the adoption of the next package of fiscal assistance and
the prospect of lifting quarantine restrictions and opening the economy,
are increasing [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) interest in US assets and, ultimately, in the
dollar. It is likely to continue strengthening next week if the
situation on the US government bond market remains favorable for its
strengthening.

The next week will not be rich with important macro data, and on Monday
banks in many Catholic countries will be closed due to Easter Monday.
Nevertheless, financial market participants next week will pay attention
to the publication of important macro statistics from the United States,
China, Canada, as well as the results of the meeting of the central bank
of Australia.

 **Traders should pay attention to the publication of the following
macro indicators:**

 ***during the coming week, new events may be added to the [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) and
/ or some scheduled events may be canceled**

 ****GMT time**

###  **Monday, April 5**

The Catholic world celebrates Easter Monday. Banks in Europe and America
will be closed. Forex trading volumes will be low.

###  **14:00 USD Services** **PMI (from ISM) in the US**

This indicator assesses the state of the services sector in the US
economy. The services sector (as opposed to the manufacturing sector)
has practically no impact on the country's GDP.

In January, this indicator came out with a value of 58.7, and in
February - at 55.3. A result above 50 is seen as positive for the USD.
However, a relative decline in the index could negatively affect the
dollar in the short term. Forecast for March: 58.5, which is likely to
have a positive overall effect on the USD.

###  **Tuesday, April 6**

###  **04:30 AUD RBA's decision on interest rate. RBA's accompanying
statement**

In March 2020, the RBA made 2 rate cuts bringing it to the level of
0.25% and launched a quantitative easing program. At the same time, the
target level of yield for the 3-year government bonds of Australia is
set at 0.25%. The RBA has launched a lending program for the banking
system in the amount of at least A$ 90 billion.

In early November 2020, the Reserve Bank of Australia lowered its key
rate again, bringing it and its 3-year bond target to 0.10% from 0.25%,
and announced A$ 100 billion quantitative easing program to support the
economic recovery.

“We live in extraordinary and difficult times,” said the central bank
governor Philip Lowe. In his opinion, "further stimulation is needed."
He stated this during a press conference on March 19, 2020, when the RBA
lowered the interest rate during its unscheduled meeting.

The main negative factors for the Australian economy are weak wages
growth, a weak labor market and a slowdown in growth. Annual inflation
has remained below the 2-3% target set by the RBA for four years.

Unemployment in the country has remained above the 5% level for many
years, unwilling to decline. Now the Australian economy is experiencing
difficulties due to the coronavirus pandemic, which has hit the tourism
and transport sectors hard.

It is expected that at this meeting the Central Bank of Australia will
leave the rate at the current level of 0.1%, although unexpected
decisions are not ruled out.

In an accompanying statement, the leaders of the RBA will explain the
reasons for the decision on the rate. If the RBA signals the possibility
of further easing of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) in the near future, the risks of a
further fall in the Australian dollar will increase.

###  **Wednesday, April 7**

###  **18:00 USD Minutes of the March meeting of the Federal Open Market
Committee**

FOMC minutes are usually released by the Fed two or three weeks after
the date of the decision on interest rates.

The publication of the minutes is extremely important for determining
the course of the current Fed [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) and the prospects for raising
interest rates in the United States. The volatility of trading in
financial markets during the publication of the minutes usually
increases, since the text often contains either changes or clarifying
details regarding the results of the last FOMC Fed meeting.

During the March meeting, the Fed leaders did not change the parameters
of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), signaling that the interest rate would remain at
minimum levels until the end of 2023.

At a subsequent press conference, the Fed Chairman Jerome Powell made it
clear that no adjustments are planned in the near future either.
Purchases of Treasury securities in the amount of $ 80 billion a month
and mortgage-backed securities in the amount of $ 40 billion a month
will continue in the same volumes.

The Fed's forecasts for inflation and economic growth have been revised
upwards, despite the fact that the key rate will not be increased until
the end of 2023. The Fed intends to adhere to a flexible approach to the
target inflation rate and is not very concerned about the growth of
government bond yields.

Loose financing conditions, combined with accelerating vaccinations, the
adoption of the next package of fiscal aid and the prospect of lifting
quarantine restrictions and opening the economy, increases the Fed's
tolerance for higher yields on government bonds, economists say.

The soft tone of the minutes will have a positive effect on stock
indices and negatively on the US dollar. The tough rhetoric of the Fed
leaders regarding the prospects for monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) will push the dollar
to further growth.

###  **Thursday, April 8**

No important macro statistics are scheduled to be released. However,
market participants will follow the speech of the head of the Fed Jerome
Powell, which starts at 16:00. Powell's comments could have an impact on
both short-term and long-term USD trading if he revisits the Fed's
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). A more hawkish stance on the Fed's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) is
seen as positive and strengthening the US dollar, while a more cautious
position is seen as negative for the USD.

If he makes unexpected statements, the volatility in the financial
markets may increase. According to Powell, the current [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the Fed
is sufficient and appropriate to the situation, but the central bank is
ready to adjust it in the event of risks that may become an obstacle to
achieving its goals.

Financial market participants will carefully study his speech in order
to catch signals regarding the further actions of the Fed.

###  **Friday, April 9**

###  **01:30 CNY Consumer Price Index (CPI)**

The National Bureau of Statistics of China will release another monthly
data reflecting the dynamics of consumer prices in China. The rise in
consumer prices could trigger an acceleration in inflation, which could
force the People's Bank of China to take measures aimed at tightening
fiscal [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). Increased growth in consumer inflation may cause
appreciation of the yuan, a weak result will put pressure on the yuan.

China's economy, according to various estimates, is already the largest
in the world, pushing the US economy into second place. Therefore, the
publication of important macroeconomic indicators of this country has a
significant impact on world financial markets, primarily on the
positions of the yuan, other Asian currencies, the dollar, commodity
currencies, as well as on Chinese and Asian stock indices. China is the
largest buyer of raw materials and a supplier of a wide range of
finished products to the world commodity market.

In January 2021, the growth of the consumer inflation index was +1.0%
(-0.3% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)), and in February +0.6% (-0.2% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)).

Deterioration of macroeconomic indicators, including a decrease in
consumer inflation, may negatively affect the positions of the yuan, as
well as commodity currencies such as the Canadian, Australian, and New
Zealand dollars. To a greater extent, this applies to the Australian
dollar, since China is Australia's largest trade and economic partner.

According to the forecast, the consumer price index is expected to grow
by +0.6% in March, but decrease by -0.4% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/).

The growth of the consumer inflation index will positively affect the
quotes of the yuan, as well as commodity currencies, primarily the
Australian dollar. However, a relative decline in CPI may negatively
affect them.

###  **13:30 CAD Unemployment rate in Canada**

Statistics Canada is to publish data on the country's labor market for
March.

Unemployment has risen in Canada in recent months amid massive business
closures due to coronavirus and layoffs. Unemployment rose from the
usual 5.6% - 5.7% to 7.8% in March and up to 13.7% in May 2020. If
unemployment continues to rise, the Canadian dollar will decline. If the
data is better than the previous value, the Canadian dollar will
strengthen. A decrease in the unemployment rate is a positive factor for
the CAD, an increase in unemployment is a negative factor. It is
expected that in March, unemployment was at the level of 8% (against
8.2% in February, 9.4% in January, 8.8% in December, 8.6% in November).
