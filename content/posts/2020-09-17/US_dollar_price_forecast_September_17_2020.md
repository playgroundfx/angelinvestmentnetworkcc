Dollar scared the doves. Forecast for 17.09.2020Dmitri Demidenko

As expected, the [EURUSD][1] pair reacted to Jerome Powell’s speech. I
will sum up the outcomes of the Fed’s meeting. At the end of the
article, I will offer a plan to trade [EURUSD][1] today and this week.

## Fundamental US dollar forecast for today

Everything is relative. When the Fed started hiking the interest rates
in 2015, the FOMC officials expected the unemployment rate to reach 5%
and the inflation rate to be below its 2% target in the next three
years. Currently, the US central bank expects to see the unemployment
level at 4% in the long run. However, the Federal Reserve is not willing
to raise the federal funds rate even is the PCE exceeds 2%. Five years
ago, the Fed was proactive. At present, the central bank is willing to
wait patiently until the US economy recovers. The Fed’s stance has
become more dovish than it was earlier. Nonetheless, Jerome Powell,
speaking at the press conference after the FOMC September meeting,
hasn’t said anything new compared to his speech in virtual Jackson Hole.
As a result, the dollar has strengthened.

The Fed doesn’t seem to worry about the dollar strengthening, at least
not as much as the ECB worries about the euro appreciation. The central
bank has suggested more positive forecasts for the US GDP (from -6.5% to
-3.7%) and unemployment (from 9.3% to 7.6%) in 2020. Jerome Powell has
claimed that the US economy has been recovering faster than expected
during the last 60 days. Ahead of the FOMC meeting, the [EURUSD][1]
bulls were concerned about the projections for the federal funds rate
hike before 2024 and the lack of transparency in the Fed’s average
inflation targeting plan. The concerns have become a reality. Four FOMC
officials expect the tightening of the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) in 2023, one
committee member says it will occur already in 2022.

So, it is natural that the [EURUSD][1] bulls are discouraged after
Powell’s speech. The Fed’s Chair has announced that the Fed should
maintain the interest rates low until the labor market reaches the full
employment level and the inflation moderately exceeds 2%. Powell has
said nothing new compared to his speech in Jackson Hole. The attempts to
clarify the new strategy failed amid the disputes among the FOMC
members. Some officials said they wanted more clarity about the economic
outlook before implementing the new [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) course; Robert Kaplan and
Neel Kashkari openly opposed it.

When the markets do not get what they want, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s’ disappointment
results in selloffs. The EURUSD correction is no exception. Moreover,
the dollar is supported by Donald Trump’s calls to the Conservatives for
the fiscal stimulus boost. The stalled negotiations on the new financial
aid package hinder the US GDP recovery, which is clear from the retail
sales data.

Democrats insisted on the additional aid of $3.5 trillion, next, they
agreed to accept $2.2 trillion. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin spoke
about $1.5 trillion. The US president hopes to settle down this issue,
which should support the US GDP recovery and send the [EURUSD][1] down.

### [EURUSD][1] trading plan today

I recommend holding the EURUSD sell trades entered at the [breakout of
level 1.1795][2]. If the pair breaks through the September low close to
1.1745, it will be relevant to open new sell positions. The targets are
the levels of 1.162 and 1.1595.
