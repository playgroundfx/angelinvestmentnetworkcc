Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 17.09.2020Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I suggest entry signals
to trade each cryptocurrency intraday.

The Bitcoin is forming the impulse wave (C) that hasn’t yet completed,
so, it is relevant to enter a long trade. Ripple price is also rising,
so, it is relevant to buy XRPUSD.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

 ****

The BTCUSD market continues forming the double down zigzag, with the
first leg, wave [W] completed inside. The Bitcoin price chart is now
drawing the upward linking wave [X] that is composed of three sub-waves
(A), (B), and (C). The price must be rising now in the bullish impulse
wave (C). This impulse should end at level 11480, where the entire
linking wave [X] will be 61.8% of the zigzag-shaped wave [W], according
to Fibonacci retracements. This ratio is highly likely to be reached.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today

Buy 11000.00, tp 11480.00

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

 ****

The XRPUSD market continues to form the downtrend. There must be
developing the double zigzag that has been half-complete. The bear wave
(W) has ended as a simple zigzag. Next, the price has started rising in
the linking wave (X) that is composed of the sub-waves A-B-C. Wave A is
a leading diagonal, corrective wave B is a zigzag; wave C is an impulse
that hasn’t yet ended. The price should stop rising around level 0.278,
where wave (X) will be 50% of wave (W).

### Trading plan for **[XRPUSD][2]** today

Buy 0.255, tp 0.278

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

 ****

At the most recent section of the ETHUSD chart, there continues forming
the simple down zigzag. Within this zigzag, the bearish impulse wave A
has finished, and the market is rising in the corrective wave B. Wave B
is likely to be unfolding as a bullish triple zigzag, composed of the
sub-waves [W]-[X]-[Y]-[X]-[Z]. In the next few days, the corrective wave
[Z] could conclude the triple combination at a level of around 418.00.
At this level, the B correction will be 61.8% of the A impulse.

### Trading plan **[ETHUSD][3]** today

Buy 378.00, tp 418.00
