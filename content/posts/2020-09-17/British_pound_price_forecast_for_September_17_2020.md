Pound is playing with fire. Forecast for 17.09.20Dmitri Demidenko

Investors are focused on the fact that the UK violates EU rules. How
will it end how will influence the sterling? In the end, there is the
[GBPUSD][1] trading plan, as usual.

## Fundamental Pound forecast for this week

While the majority believes the pound is going to crash, some traders
are buying GBP. The cost of hedging against the [GBPUSD][1] drop is now
30% less than that of hedging against the pair’s rise. Besides, the
current levels are appealing to the sterling bulls. At first, it seems
that entering the pound’s longs is a crazy idea. The UK domestic market
bill has been adopted by the House of Commons. However, if the UK-EU
deal is signed at the last moment, the pound buyers will benefit. And
the UK negotiators have done this many times.

The second week of September was the worst for the pound since the mass
selloffs in March. This resulted from excessive speculative net longs
and the fact that [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are again concerned about the Brexit issues.
Ahead of the [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) that Boris Johnson was going to violate the agreement
with the EU, hedge funds boosted the net longs up to the highest level
over the past five months. Once there was the information about the
domestic market bill, large [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s have started exiting longs.

### Dynamics of pound speculative positions

Politic, rather than economics, triggered the sterling correction.
Despite the reports that the UK unemployment surged to the highest level
since 2013, and the inflation rate has slowed down by 0.2%, the
[GBPUSD][1] rate started rising amid the talks about the disputes within
the Conservative party because of Boris Johnson’s willingness to break
up the deal with the EU. What does it mean? Is it just a bluffing to
force the EU to make concessions? Or is Boris Johnson willing to
withdraw the UK with or without a deal and is prepared for a lawsuit
from the EU for breaking the obligations supposed by the agreement? The
answer will determine the sterling future trend.

Under such conditions, the BoE is likely to express a wait-and-see
attitude at the September meeting. Andrew Bailey and his colleagues will
rather wait for more signals about how the economy is recovering, how
deep is the employment drawdown. And, finally, the Bank of England will
also wait to see how the Brexit story will end. Bloomberg’s experts
expect the UK QE to boost by £50 billion, reaching £800 billion in
total. The derivatives market projects the cut of the BoE interest rate
in February 2021. Morgan Stanley analysts say the interest rate will
drop to 0.5% in case of a no-deal Brexit.

### Forecasts for BoE interest rates

If the Bank of England surprises the markets and lowers the interest
rates unexpectedly, the [GBPUSD][2] could drop below the bottom of
figure 29. Otherwise, the sterling trend will depend on the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
pursued by Boris Johnson.

### [GBPUSD][2] trading plan for the week

The UK Prime Minister, announcing the domestic market bill, is going
all-in. The EU officials wonder if he is bluffing. Everything looks so
real that one may have to throw down the cars. If [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s see that
Brussels is going to make concessions, the sterling will rise up. It is
not yet clear if it makes sense to buy the [GBPUSD][1]. If the pair goes
up above 1.31, one could consider entering longs.
