Short-term forecast for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 17.09.2020Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my colleagues! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for day traders.

The gold price hasn’t broken out the resistance level. The dollar has
been up in all pairs amid yesterday’s [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/). EURUSD bears are trying to
break out the key support of the middle-term uptrend [1.1811 – 1.1791].
If the US session closes the euro-dollar below the support today, the
trend will turn down.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

It is still relevant to enter oil purchases according to the pattern in
the medium-term chart. The middle-term oil trend is up. The target is
the high of August.

If the price breaks out the trend key support [37.34 – 36.72], we shall
sell oil with the target at the lower Target Zone 2 [31.14 — 30.52].

The oil short-term trend has turned up. Yesterday, the US session close
the price above Intermediary Zone [39.44 – 39.13]. Starting from today,
we enter buy trades with the target at the upper Target Zone [42.85 –
42.23].

I recommend entering long trades in the zone between Additional Zone and
Intermediary Zone. This is the price zone of [38.77 - 36.91]. To enter
buy trades, we need a corresponding pattern.

It is not yet relevant to sell oil.

### [USCrude ][1]trading ideas for today:

Buy according to the pattern in the zone of [38.77 - 36.91]. TakeProfit:
Target Zone [42.85 - 42.23]. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

The gold price hasn’t broken out the resistance level today. The dollar
has strengthened amid yesterday’s [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/). As a result, gold is falling. I
suggest entering holding the middle-term sell trades and entering new
ones at the current levels with the target at the levels of 1902.9,
1862.3.

Gold buyers haven’t consolidated the price above the key resistance of
the short-term downtrend. The resistance is in the zone [1957.7 –
1953.0]. None of the US session closed the price above the zone, as you
can see from the chart. So, the short-term downtrend continues.

Today, the gold price chart has drawn a double top pattern to sell. I
recommend entering short trades according to this pattern. There will
hardly be a deep correction up, as there is a sell signal in the medium-
term gold price chart.

The sell target is Target Zone [1899.4 – 1890.1]. It is not relevant to
buy gold now.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

Sell according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone [1957.7 - 1953.0].
TakeProfit: Target Zone [1899.4 - 1890.1]. StopLoss: according to the
pattern rules.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

EURUSD bears are trying to break out the key support of the middle-term
uptrend [1.1811 – 1.1791]. If the US session closes the euro-dollar
below the support, the trend will turn down. Starting from tomorrow, we
shall sell the euro with a target at Target Zone 2 [1.1611 — 1.1591].

It is clear from the hourly chart that the short-term trend has turned
down. The price has broken out the trend key support [1.1817 – 1.1807].
The 1-2-3 buy pattern didn’t work out yesterday.

Now, we shall enter sell trades with the target at the lower Target Zone
[1.1717 – 1.1697]. I recommend entering sell trades on the correction up
to [1.1847 – 1.1807]. A stop loss for sell positions should be above
1.1847, at a sufficient distance.

It is not yet relevant to buy the euro-dollar.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

Sell in the zone of [1.1847 - 1.1807]. TakeProfit: Target Zone [1.1717 -
1.1697]. StopLoss: 1.1869.

> IZ - Intermediary Zone: responsible for the price momentum reversing

>

> TZ - Target Zone: a zone that is 75% likely to be reached after IZ
breakout.

>

> GZ - Gold Zone: zone in the medium-term momentum.

>

> All zones are calculated based on the average [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) price of the
instrument and margin requirements of the futures.
