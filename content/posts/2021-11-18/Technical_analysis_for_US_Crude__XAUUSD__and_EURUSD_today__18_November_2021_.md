Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

The short-term oil downtrend continued.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

The short-term oil downtrend continued. As a result, the Target Zone
78.48 - 77.97 was broken out. Now the target for sales is the Gold Zone
75.93 - 75.67. I recommend looking for new oil sales on correction at
strong resistance levels.

The Additional Zone 78.07 - 77.94 and the Intermediary Zone 79.47 -
79.22 serve as strong resistances. To open sales, wait for a correction,
a test of the zone, and the formation of a reversal pattern. Focus on
today's low as the first profit-taking target.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

  1. Sell according to the pattern in Additional Zone 78.07 - 77.94. TakeProfit: Gold Zone 75.93 - 75.67. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

The short-term gold trend is down. XAU has reached the zone of good sell

A reversal pattern is required to enter sales. In this case, the target
for sales will be November 16 low and the Target Zone 1839 - 1835.

above are required. The target for purchases will be the upper Target

The euro is trading in a short-term downtrend. The target for sales is
