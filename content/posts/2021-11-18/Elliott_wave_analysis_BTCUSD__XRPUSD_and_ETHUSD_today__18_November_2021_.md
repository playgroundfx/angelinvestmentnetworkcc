Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 18.11.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

Cryptocurrency pairs are moving towards the targets indicated in the
outlined scenarios.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

The BTCUSD market is forming the global corrective trend, with the
upward wave (A) completed inside as a bullish five-wave impulse. There
is unfolding the beginning of the bearish wave. There could be unfolding
an impulse sub-wave, with the first two sub-waves 1 and 2 completed
inside. The Bitcoin price should go up to level 64360.55 following a
short corrective wave [2]. Next, the market will resume declining. One
could consider entering buy trades in the current situation.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 60256.50, TP 64360.55

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

 ****

The XRPUSD market is forming the linking wave (X) as a triangle, with
sub-waves A-B-C-D completed inside (the first two sub-waves are not seen
in the chart). The price should continue rising in the final wave E,
possibly unfolding as a simple zigzag. Wave E should finish at a level
of 1.325. One could enter purchases in the current situation.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] **** today:

Buy 1.131, TP 1.325

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

The ETHUSD market continues forming the bullish impulse, with corrective
wave 4 completed inside as a simple zigzag [A]-[B]-[C]. The most recent
chart section displays the price rising in the fifth sub-wave unfolding
as either an impulse or an ending diagonal. The Ethereum price should be
rising in sub-wave 5 to a level above 4673.00. One could enter purchases
in the current situation.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Buy 4303.33, TP 4673.00
