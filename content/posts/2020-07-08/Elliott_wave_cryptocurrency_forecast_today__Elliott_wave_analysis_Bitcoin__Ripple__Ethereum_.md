corrective wave [4] as a double three (W)-(X)-(Y). The market is now
moving up. There have finished two small sub-waves, impulse (1) and

the third sub-wave to a level above 9799.80, which is the previous high.

be developing the initial part of the bullish impulse wave 3, with the
sub-waves [1]-[2] and (1)-(2) completed within. Therefore, the price
