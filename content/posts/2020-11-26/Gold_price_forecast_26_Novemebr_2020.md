Gold faces bad times. Forecast as of 26.11.2020Dmitri Demidenko

Neither the dollar’s weakness nor the Treasury yield, which doesn’t
grow, do not support the [XAUUSD][1] price. Let us analyze the gold
outlook and a make up a trading plan.

## Monthly gold fundamental forecast

Any trading asset gores up and down, the market is moving in cycles. The
market cycle often depends on the economic cycle. The [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) proves
that the [best time](https://www.fixpro.org/post/forex-best-time-to-trade/) to buy stocks is the recovery period following the
economic downturn. This is the bad time for gold. Investors believe in
the prosperous future, the risk appetite is increasing. Traders look for
the assets other than gold to invest their money. Investors sell gold
and buy other trading instruments, doesn’t matter if they are stocks,
cryptocurrencies or commodities.

In 2020, gold has faced two worst [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) sell-offs since 2013. The last
gold crash resulted from the positive [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) about vaccines developed
Pfizer and BioNTech. Markets believe in the victory over the pandemic;
the stocks and Treasury yields surged, and the [XAUUSD][1] has dropped.
However, the Treasury yields have dropped since then, and the US dollar
is weak, which should be good [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) for gold. But this time, the market
is different. Investors continue exiting [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/)s, whose gold holding have
contracted by more than 2% from the October highs. The holdings of the
SPDR Gold Shares fund has declined to the lowest level since July.

### Dynamics of SPDR Gold Shares holdings

Traders do not want to sell off bonds amid the concerns about the Fed’s
‘operation twist’, which is to be launched in December. The greenback is
falling amid the lower political uncertainty and higher demand for the
risk assets. Why isn’t the gold price growing? Contrary to the
[historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) pattern, the Treasury yield, the USD index and the gold price
are following the same way.

There are several factors pressing down gold. Investors are willing to
buy stocks, commodities and the [[bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/)][2]. Furthermore, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s
fear that the gold trend will repeat the situation of 2011-2013. At that
time, after the drop from the record highs, there were enough bull in
the gold market predicting the uptrend recovery amid the central banks’
ultra-easy monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) and the US dollar weakness. The same
situation is now. Goldman Sash believes that gold will hit a fresh all-
time high in 2021 and will reach $2300 per ounce. ANZ sees the gold
price at $2100 over the next twelve months. Commerzbank expects that
Janet Yellen's appointment as Treasury Secretary will further ease
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) by the Fed, which is good [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) for [XAUUSD][1] bulls.

###  **Monthly gold trading plan**

Gold bulls bet on the reflation environment. In 2011-2013, this plan
didn’t work out. n this regard, Macquarie's forecast of a fall in prices
to $ 1550 an ounce in 2021, as the crisis has subsided, and expectations
of the Fed monetary easing have lowered, looks much more reasonable. I
don’t think the [XAUUSD][1] fall will be as sharp. However, over the
three-year investment horizon, gold price can well hit the level of 1550
or so. It makes sense to hold down the shorts entered at the levels of
[$1965][3] and also at [$1900, $1875 and $1865.][4] It is also relevant
to enter new shorts on the drawdowns to $1825 and $1845. The medium-term
targets are at $1775 and $1725.
