Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 26.11.2020Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I suggest entry signals
to trade each cryptocurrency.

The three major cryptocurrency pairs are rising in the impulse sub-
waves. Let study the cryptocurrencies’ charts in more detail.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

 ****

The corrective wave B has completed as a contracting triangle within the
upward zigzag of a larger degree. After the triangle pattern finished,
the market has started rising in the upward wave C. There have completed
the sub-waves [1]-[2]-[3]-[4], wave [5] has recently started unfolding.
The sub-waves (1)-(2) have finished. The Bitcoin price should be rising
in impulse (3) to a level of 21227.15. An approximate trajectory of
Bitcoin future price movement is outlined in the chart.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 18708.50. TP 21227.15

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

 ****

The XRPUSD market continues forming the bullish impulse C which has sent
the price up. The impulse wave [3], composed of the five sub-waves, has
ended. The market is declining in the corrective wave [4]. This
correction should complete soon, and the price will start rising in the
final wave [5] towards a level of 0.840, as it is outlined in the chart.

### Trading plan for **[XRPUSD][2]** today:

Buy 0.618, TP 0.840

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

 ****

At the most recent section of the chart, there is forming the fifth leg
of the bullish impulse wave C. Within wave [5], there is unfolding the
final impulse wave (5) of a smaller degree. There should have finished
the first three legs of impulse (5), and the price is going down in the
corrective wave 4. Wave 4 should shortly end, and the ETHUSD market will
resume growing in wave 5 towards level 653.00, as it is outlined in the
chart.

### Trading plan for  **[ETHUSD][3] **today:

Buy 562.99, TP 653.00
