Forex in November: what surprises have the central banks prepared?
Forecast for GBPUSD, GBPCHF, USDCAD, USDNOK...Dmitri Demidenko

Faster normalization of the Fed's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) than the markets
expect, as well as strong US employment data, will bring interest back
to the US dollar. However, other central banks may surprise traders.
Let's discuss the Forex outlook and make up a trading plan for
[GBPUSD][1], [GBPCHF][2], [USDCAD][3], [USDNOK][4], [AUDJPY][5] and
[NZDJPY][6].

## Monthly G10 currencies fundamental forecast

[Expectations][7] of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) normalization and the return of
financial markets to normal in October paid off handsomely. Supported by
rising US Treasury yields and increased global risk appetite,
[AUDJPY][5] and [NZDJPY][6] purchases yielded 6.4% and 6.1%,
respectively. [AUDCAD][8] price rose by 1.65%. 14% to the deposit for
the month is quite a good figure. This fact allows traders to look with
interest at the future of currency pairs in Forex.

In November, the US and New Zealand dollars, the euro, Swiss franc, and
Australian dollar, usually performed better than other G10 currencies.
In contrast, the British pound, Canadian dollar, and Japanese yen were
most often outsiders. The pound statistics were especially weak from
1975 to 2020. GBP closed in the red zone 29 months out of 46.

The Australian and New Zealand dollars, the euro and the Swiss franc are
among the November leaders in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of medians. The Norwegian krone was
included in the list of outsiders. Together with weak CAD statistics,
this circumstance suggests that the oil uptrend will no longer be as
impressive as in October.

During favorable periods, the NZD and the AUD rose by an average of 2.4%
and 2.3%, the euro by 2.1%, and the Swiss franc by 2.6%. After closing
the month in red, the pound and the CAD lost 2.1% on average, and the
Norwegian krone lost 2.6%.

### Price dynamics during rise-fall periods

The main events of November will be the meetings of the Fed and the Bank
of England, the US October jobs report, as well as the return of topics
such as Brexit and the public debt ceiling. The first three will occur
at the very beginning of the month and can set an impulse for dollar
pairs for several weeks. In particular, if the Fed tapers QE more
decisively than [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s expect, and US employment data will be strong
(due to a successful fight against Delta), [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s will be interested
again in the USD.

The pound's seasonal weakness is worrying [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/). The Bank of England
convinced [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s about raising the interest rate at the 4th MPC
meeting so much that if it abandons this idea, the [GBPUSD][1] and
[GBPCHF][2] prices will go down sharply. The situation for sterling is
exacerbated by tensions over the already resolved Brexit issue, possibly
triggering a trade war between the UK and the EU.

The expansion of OPEC+ commitments concerning the increased production
and lifting sanctions against Iran in the event of successful
negotiations on the nuclear program can provoke a [Brent][9] and
[WTI][10] rollback. These events will make longs on [USDCAD][3] and
[USDNOK][4] relevant.

In the second half of November, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s will probably focus on the
problem of the US government debt ceiling. Against the background of the
end of the corporate reporting season, it may lead to a rollback of
stock indices and increased demand for safe-haven assets. As a result,
exit [AUDJPY][5] and [NZDJPY][6] longs and start forming short trades.
