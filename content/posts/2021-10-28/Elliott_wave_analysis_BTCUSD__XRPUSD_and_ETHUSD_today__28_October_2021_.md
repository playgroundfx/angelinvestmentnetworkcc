Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 28.10.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

Ripple and Ethereum haven’t completed corrective waves, so the prices
could continue declining. Next, the cryptocurrency pairs will start
rising.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

Bitcoin is developing the final wave in the large zigzag-shaped
correction [B] — impulse wave (C). The (C) wave is composed of five sub-
waves marked with red letters 1-2-3-4-5. Correction 4 is currently
unfolding as a simple zigzag [A]-[B]-[C]. Impulse [A] has finished,
correction [B] could finish at a level of 63790.00, as outlined in the
chart. An approximate trajectory of the Bitcoin future price movement is
outlined in the chart.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 58654.00, TP 63790.00

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

The XRPUSD market continues forming the large linking wave as a triple
zigzag [W]-[X]-[Y]-[X]-[Z]. The first three sub-waves have completed,
and there is unfolding the final leg in the second linking wave [X]. The
bearish wave (Y) should soon end as a double zigzag. Next, the market
will be rising in the motive wave [Z]. The price could break through the
high of 1.159, marked by sub-wave (X).

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] **** today:

Buy 0.997, TP 1.159

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

The ETHUSD market is forming a large corrective wave B, with the final
impulse wave [C] developing inside. Sub-waves (1)-(2)-(3) have completed
in the [C] wave. There is developing corrective wave (4), composed of
sub-waves W-X-Y. The final wave Y should soon end, and the market will
start rising in wave (5). Wave (5) could end around level 4360.00,
marked by impulse wave (3).

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Buy 3975.70, TP 4360.00
