Which party is euro to choose? Forecast as of 28.10.2021Dmitri Demidenko

October marked a split among the members of central banks. Some
lawmakers adhere to the mantra about the temporary nature of inflation,
others consider high prices to be a longer-term factor. Which party does
the ECB belong to? How will this affect [EURUSD][1]? Let us discuss the
Forex outlook and make up a trading plan.

## Fundamental euro forecast for today

For the first time in a long time, foreign exchange rates depend on
interest rates as central banks begin to signal monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
normalization. At the same time, the split in the central bankers'
opinions is well traced. Some officials ignore the acceleration of
inflation; others express concerns about the permanent nature of high
prices. The decision of the Bank of Canada to quit the QE has supported
not only the Canadian dollar but also the New Zealand dollar and the
pound. While lower forecasts of the Bank of Japan for inflation and GDP
press down not only the yen but also the euro.

Instead of cutting QE purchases from CA $2 billion to CA $1 billion a
week, the Bank of Canada has said that it no longer needs QE as the
economy approaches a full recovery. Moreover, the overnight rate is
likely to be raised earlier than expected. Hawkish and important is the
BoC's announcement that the main drivers of price increases, like energy
and supply chain bottlenecks, now appear more resilient than previously
expected. The Bank of England and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand share
a similar viewpoint, so the strengthening of the NZD and GBP following
the Canadian dollar looks logical.

The opposite ideas are expressed by the ECB and the Bank of Japan. The
latter lowered its inflation forecast for 2021 from 0.6% to 0%. It
expects the inflation rate to reach only half of its 2% target in 2023,
which suggests that the BoJ will maintain its ultra-easy monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
for years to come. Will the ECB follow its path? Or are the signals
given by money markets reasonable?

The rise in the euro-area inflationary expectations is as fast as in the
USA. The euro-area consumer prices break through 13-year highs, giving
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s a reason to expect the interest rate hike in late 2022.
According to market expectations, the ECB rate could rise from -0.5% to
0% by the end of 2023.

A change in the [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s' expectations results in tightening financial
conditions, leading to the ECB's verbal interventions. However,
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s ignored the claim of the ECB chief economist that markets
misinterpret the central bank's [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) guidance. Will Christine Lagarde
dissuade markets? This question turns a seemingly uninteresting ECB
meeting into a very exciting one.

### Weekly [EURUSD][1] trading plan

I suppose the ECB can discourage the sellers of the euro area bonds and
the euro buyers by lowering inflation forecasts for 2022-2023 or by
declaring that it is not going to raise rates earlier than 2024.
Otherwise, verbal interventions alone won't set the [EURUSD][1] bulls
back, as Lagarde's dovish comments have been prices in the main currency
pair. Therefore, one could consider buying the euro versus the US dollar
on the breakout of the resistance at 1.1625. If the price fails to break
out the resistance or goes below the support at 1.1585, it will be
relevant to sell the pair.
