Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 28.10.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

The gold price hasn't broken out key support of the short-term uptrend.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

Yesterday, the short-term oil trend reversed down after breaking out the
Intermediary Zone 82.42 - 82.16. As a result, level 81.13 was broken
out. The target for sales is now the lower Target Zone 79.86 - 79.35.

At the moment, oil is trading in the correction and testing the
Additional Zone 81.51 - 81.38. Look for sales according to the pattern
with the target in the lower Target Zone in the beforementioned AZ.

If the AZ is broken out today during the trading session, the correction
will continue with the target in the Intermediary Zone 82.91 - 82.66.
The IZ serves as the border of a new downtrend. It would also be
reasonable to look for oil sales according to the pattern in the
abovementioned IZ.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

  1. Sell according to the pattern in Additional Zone 81.51 - 81.38. TakeProfit: Target Zone 79.86 - 79.35. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. Sell according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 82.91 - 82.66. TakeProfit: Target Zone 79.86 - 79.35. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

The gold price hasn't broken out key support of the short-term uptrend.
As a result, the price returned to the Intermediary Zone 1795 - 1793. A
“double bottom” buy pattern has also been formed.

Today it is profitable to hold purchases within this pattern, with the
first target at the October 25 high, the second target at the October 22
high, and the third target at the Gold Zone 1818 - 1816.

Selling gold requires a trend reversal by breaking out level 1785.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

Hold longs entered in the zone of 1795 - 1787. TakeProfit: Gold Zone
1818 — 1816. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

The euro continues to trade in a correction to the short-term uptrend.
At the top, there is a resistance at level 1.1622. At the bottom, there
is a support at level 1.1576. Today, I recommend working within this
range, entering sales in the resistance zone, and entering purchases at
the support level.

If the Additional Zone 1.1633 - 1.1628 is broken out upside, the price
will test the next level of 1.1664. When level 1.1664 is broken out, the
upper Target Zone 1.1718 - 1.1700 will be reached.

If the price breaks out the support level of 1.1576, then the short-term
trend will reverse down. In this case, sell euro with the first target
at level 1.1525.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

  1. Buy according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 1.1577 - 1.1568. TakeProfit: 1.1665. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. Sell according to the pattern in Additional Zone 1.1633 - 1.1629. TakeProfit: Intermediary Zone 1.1577 - 1.1568. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.
