A global impulse wave has been forming here for a long time. Its fourth
part - correction [4] - has formed as a contracting horizontal triangle
(a)-(b)-(c)-(d)-(e). Then the market grew in the final bullish impulse
[5]. The ascending movement is supposed to continue in sub-waves
(3)-(4)-(5) to a level of 12,200 in the nearest time. The chart shows an
approximate pattern of an eventual future movement.

Wave analysis for Bitcoin, Ripple and Ethereum][4]**

An ascending linking wave [X], which consists of thee main sub-waves
(A)-(B)-(C), is developing in the form of a simple zigzag.  The bullish
impulse wave (C) of this zigzag marked with sub-waves 1-2-3-4-5 is
forming at the moment. Sub-waves 1 and 3 are simple impulses; corrective
wave 2 is a double zigzag [w]-[x]-[y]. Supposedly, impulse 3 has fully
formed and we are now at the beginning of descending correction 4. It
isn’t expected to be big, so the price may resume growing in wave 5 to a
level of 0.281.

Corrective wave [4] formed as a double three pattern after a long period
of development.  The ultimate wave (5) of the last impulse [5] is
developing at the moment. The growth may continue in this wave to a
level of 360.00. Then the market may reverse and start moving downwards.
