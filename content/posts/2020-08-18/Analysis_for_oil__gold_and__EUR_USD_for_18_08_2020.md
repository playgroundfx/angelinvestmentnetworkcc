Analysis for oil, gold and, EUR/USD for 18.08.2020Alex Rodionov

##  **Oil price forecast** **for** **today:** ** **USCrude****
******analysis**

Oil traders broke out Target Zone 5 [41.67 - 40.92]. The next upside
target in the medium-term uptrend is Target Zone 6 [49.17 – 48.42].

I recommend entering purchases both at the current prices, close to the
broken-out TZ5 and in the trend key support [37.23 - 36.61]. We need a
pattern to buy.

In the short-term chart, the situation has not changed since yesterday.
The short-term trend is up. The resistance is in the zone of [42.70 –
42.55], traders haven't broken it out yet.

For today, I recommend looking for sell entries according to the pattern
in the correction. The downside target will the trend key support [40.33
– 40.02].

It will be relevant to buy oil when the price breaks out Additional Zone
and consolidates above. There will be an entry point on the zone retest,
and the target will be Gold Zone 5 [45.04 — 44.67].

##  **Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis**

Gold price is breaking out the key resistance of the middle-term
downtrend [1957.9 – 1949.2]. If the US session closes the price above
the zone today, starting from tomorrow, we shall enter buy trades on the
correction with a target in Target Zone 2 [2044.9 — 2036.2].

The shorter timeframe displays a short-term uptrend. Within this trend,
the price broke out Target Zone [1957.9 – 1949.2 yesterday and reached
Gold Zone [1997.0 – 1992.7] today.

If the buyers consolidate the price above Gold Zone, the next upside
target will be Target Zone 2 [2051.5 – 2042.2].

Strong supports zones are Additional Zone [1984.3 - 1981.9] and

##  **Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis**

The EUR/USD upside target was Target Zone 4 [1.1914 – 1.1896]. As you
see from the chart, the zone has been reached. The further price growth
is doubtful as TZ4 is a strong medium-term resistance.

![LiteForex: Analysis for oil, gold and, EUR/USD for 18.08.2020][7]

The euro short-term term is up. The price has reached Target Zone
[1.1911 – 1.1893] today. I recommend exiting buy trades if you have any.
A correction could start.

In cases of a correction, we shall open new longs according to patterns
in Additional Zone [1.1858 - 1.1854] and Intermediary Zone [1.1813 –
1.1804]. The target will be at the local high.

It will be relevant to sell the euro when the trend turns down. The
trend will reverse if the price breaks out Intermediary Zone downside.
If so, we shall enter sell trades with a target in the lower Target
Zone.
