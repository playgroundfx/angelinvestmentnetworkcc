XAU/USD forecast: Gold market will face a turmoilDmitri Demidenko

## Fundamental gold price forecast for today

### Coronavirus vaccines will hold XAU/USD bulls back

Mass gold sell-offs in the mid-August discouraged the gold bulls.
However, a quick rebound above $2000 per ounce allowed large banks to
resume their recommendations to buy. According to Credit Suisse
forecasts, gold prices will grow to $2500 in 2021. Standard Chartered
Bank believes [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s will use any price decline to open long
positions amid the weak dollar, low bond rates, and substantial fiscal
stimuli. There are enough bulls in the gold market, and this fact alone
raises concerns in the extended rally of the [XAU/USD][1]. Can there be
turmoil?

Many bullish factors have already been priced in the XAUUSD, and there
are not so many growth drivers left. I mean the long-term dollar
weakness and the Fed’s willingness to put up with the inflation above
its 2% target for as long as it is necessary. The problem is whether
consumer prices will grow. The inflation level, expected by the bond
market, returned to the January level in five years; but it is still
below the Fed’s target. Inflation-adjusted five-year [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) suggest a
little chance that the indicator will be above 3%. It is more likely to
slide below 1%. The story of 2009-2011 can repeat in the gold market.
Then, the gold price, having reached its all-time high, crashed, as
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s didn’t nay more believe that the fiscal stimulus could
accelerate the PCE.

In my opinion, the bond market can give a clue on the future gold
trends. Gold price correlates with the Treasury Inflation-Protected
Securities (TIPS). The increase in the TIPS yields on August 11-12
triggered an [XAU/USD][1] correction.

The gold rally takes place ahead of auctions and amid talks about the
Russian vaccine. The more is fiscal stimulus, the more money needs
Treasury. The initial public offering makes [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s sell securities in
the secondary market, which pushes up the yields. Taking into account
vast scales of the state funding, such a situation could repeat, which
increases the risks of instability in the gold market.

Still, the most significant danger for the gold buyers could result from
good [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) about the COVID-19 vaccine. The Treasury yields are quite
responsive to the pandemic. Positive information about vaccines will
support the economy, but, at the same time, it will weigh on gold.
Purchasing managers think the glass is half-full, and the continuous
rally of the US PMI must support the growth of the global bond market
rates.

Therefore, gold bulls still have two big advantages. They are the
greenback weakness and the Fed’s willingness to put up with a high
inflation rate. Nonetheless, unless the consumer price growth
accelerates and the USD crashes, the [XAU/USD][1] will hardly continue
to rally. On the contrary, an increase in the Treasury yields looks more
likely, which suggests the relevance of the gold sales on the rise to
$2050-2055 and $2130-2135.
