##  **Elliott wave forecast for BTCUSD, ETHUSD, XRPUSD for today**

###  **Elliott wave[BTCUSD][1] analysis**

The chart displays the structure of the bullish impulse wave A, with
impulse wave [5] unfolding within. Sub-waves (1)-(2)-(3)-(4) have
completed within wave [5]. There is now developing impulse (5), namely
its final section. Presumably, the entire impulse pattern should finish
at a level of 12800. Therefore, the price should be rising for some time
to the indicated level.

The XRPUSD market continues rising in the linking wave [X], with the
bullish impulse wave (C) developing within wave [X]. After correction 4
completed, the fifth wave of this pattern has been unfolding as an
impulse [1]-[2]-[3]-[4]-[5]. The first four elements of this impulse
should have completed, and wave [5] is currently forming. The price
should be rising to a level of 0.340.

###  **Elliott wave[ETHUSD][5] analysis**

 **![LiteForex: Elliott wave cryptocurrency forecast today. Elliott wave

The ETHUSD market, like the BTCUSD, is following the impulse wave A,
namely, its final leg, impulse [5]. Corrective wave (4) has completed as
a horizontal contracting triangle within the impulse [5]. The market is
now rising in the final impulse wave (5). Four out of five elements of
wave (5) have completed so far. Therefore, the price should be rising
towards a level of 500.00.
