EUR/USD forecast: Will euro have reason for correction?Dmitri Demidenko

## Fundamental Euro forecast for today ****

### The market has never been more bullish on the EUR/USD

The higher is trading the euro, and the more are there talks about a
correction. Rabobank believes the move in the [EUR/USD][1] is
overstretched, based on the CFTC data and the vacation period and the
number of holidays in August. A little later, the pair may encounter a
sharp drawdown. According to Barclays, bitter negotiations for a new
coronavirus stimulus deal between Democrats and Republicans make
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s less willing to risk than earlier, which supports the US
dollar as a safe haven. Once the parties reach an agreement, the
greenback will resume the downtrend.

According to the CFTC data, assets managers increased their long euro
position to a fresh high in the week to August 11. The euro net long
positions are $30 billion. Goldman Sachs notes that hedge funds hold net
longs on the euro versus the dollar for the first time since 2018.
Excessive speculative longs increase the risks of a correction amid
profit-taking. However, there should be a reason for a drawdown, a [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/)
bit that will make [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s exist long trades. There is not any yet,
and the [EUR/USD][1] continues to rally.

The Institute of International Finance notes the CFTC data show “deep
infatuation” with the idea the dollar will be falling and the euro will
be growing. Positioning data changed from ‘extremely’ to ‘stupendously’.
According to JP Morgan, the process of portfolio diversification by
financial managers has been far from being finished, and the FX reserves
managers are especially active. This fact allowed the bank to raise its
forecasts for the [EUR/USD][1] from 1.13 to 1.2 at the end of 2020.

Barclays analysts say the stalled talks between the Democrats and the
Republicans on the fiscal stimulus plan increase the dollar demand as a
safe haven. I agree with this idea. I believe the more extended the
negotiations are, the weaker the US GDP will be in the short-term and
middle-term outlook. The growth gap between the US and the euro-area is
the main driver for the euro strengthening against the US dollar.
According to Moody’s Analytics, unless the Congress adopts a fresh
stimulus before September, the US economy will be vulnerable to anything
that goes wrong. Taking into account the COVID-19 pandemic, much could
go wrong.

Therefore, the market, in my opinion, is too bullish on the euro.
Positive factors, such as leading growth of the euro-area GDP over the
US and the diversification of investment portfolios and FX reserves in
favor of the euro and euro-denominated assets, continue working.
Besides, a dead-end in the negotiations on the US stimulus package and a
worse epidemiological situation in the US than in Europe increase
concerns about a poor reading of the US economic data shortly.
[EUR/USD][1] buyers are going to break out the resistance levels at
1.19-1.191. If they succeed, the pair can well hit 1.196 and 1.199. Will
the minutes of the Fed’s July meeting discourage them?
