Economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the week 21.09.2020 – 27.09.2020Jana Kane

##  **Review of the main events of the Forex economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the
next trading week (21.09.2020 – 27.09.2020)**

 **Trading on key Forex [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/): next week we are expecting the publication
of important macro statistics from Australia, Germany, Eurozone, Great
Britain, US, as well as the results of the meetings of the central banks
of New Zealand, Switzerland and speeches of the heads of the Bank of
England and the Fed.**

The Fed did not disappoint financial market participants and kept its
key rate at 0.25% confirming its intention to achieve an average
inflation level of 2% with long-term inflationary expectations also on
average at 2%.

According to the updated forecasts of the Fed, we should expect to hear
about rate hikes no earlier than 2023. Fed officials noted improved
financial conditions, as well as increased economic activity and an
improvement in the labor market. Investors reacted with enthusiasm to
the Fed's more positive outlook for the economy.

At the same time, Powell's statement that he considers the current
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) sufficient, and that now, in order to continue the economic
recovery, new measures of fiscal support from the government are needed,
alerted buyers in the US stock market. American stock indices declined
after the Fed meeting, and the dollar strengthened, gaining some
breathing room after falling sharply in the previous 4 months. However,
at the end of last week, the DXY dollar index, which reflects its value
against a basket of 6 major currencies, still declined. The immediate
target for the DXY dollar index in case of renewed decline will be
91.72, which is around the September and almost 3-year lows.

The central banks of Japan and Great Britain also did not change their
monetary policies at their meetings last Thursday.

The Bank of England, in particular, acknowledged the risks of a longer
period of increased unemployment and the uncertain economic outlook. The
Bank of England promised to continue considering the possibility of
negative interest rates, to which the pound reacted with a sharp short-
term fall. However, by the end of the trading day last Thursday the
GBP/USD pair returned to the opening price of the trading day. Yet the
dynamics of the dollar, which is vulnerable against the backdrop of the
Fed's aggressively stimulating monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), the progress of the
coronavirus pandemic in the country, as well as political unrest and
uncertainty ahead of the presidential elections in November, remain more
important to the dynamics of the entire foreign exchange market.

Next week, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s will pay attention to the publication of important
macro statistics from Australia, Germany, the Eurozone, Great Britain,
the United States, as well as the results of the meetings of the central
banks of New Zealand, Switzerland and the statements of the heads of the
Bank of England and the Fed.

 **Traders should pay attention to the publication of the following
macro indicators:**

 ***during the coming week, new events may be added to the [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) and
/ or some scheduled events may be canceled**

 ****** **GMT time**

###  **Monday, September 21**

###  **GBP Inflation report (exact time unknown)**

Head of the Bank of England and members of the Monetary Policy Committee
of the Bank of England will speak in parliament with comments on the
current economic situation and economic outlook. At this time, the
volatility in trading on the pound may rise sharply. In addition to GDP,
one of the main benchmarks for the Bank of England regarding the
prospects for monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) in the UK is inflation. If the tone of the
report is soft, the British stock market will gain support and the pound
will decline. Conversely, tough rhetoric of the Bank of England
representatives regarding inflation control implying an increase in the
interest rate in the UK will lead to the strengthening of the pound.

###  **14:00 USD Speech by the Chairman of the Fed Jerome Powell**

Powell's comments could affect both short-term and long-term USD trading
if he again touches on the Fed's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). A more hawkish stance
on the Fed's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) is seen as positive and strengthening the
US dollar, while a more cautious position is seen as negative for the
USD.

If he makes unexpected statements, the volatility in trading in the
financial markets may increase.

"I think the 'new norm' now is lower interest rates, lower inflation,
and possibly weaker economic growth," Powell said last year.

Based on the results of the September 2020 meeting, when the Fed kept
its key rate at 0.25% and confirmed its intention to achieve an average
inflation level of 2% with long-term inflation expectations also at an
average of 2%, Powell said that the overall activity indicators remain
below pre-coronavirus pandemic levels, and the future economic outlook
remains “unprecedentedly uncertain” and additional fiscal support from
the government may be required. According to Powell, the current [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
of the Fed is sufficient and appropriate for the situation, but the
central bank is ready to adjust it in the event of risks that may become
an obstacle to achieving its goals.

Nevertheless, financial market participants will carefully study his
speech in order to catch signals regarding the further actions of the
Fed.

###  **Tuesday, September 22**

###  **07:30 GBP Speech by the Head of the Bank of England Andrew
Bailey**

Participants in the financial markets are expecting Andrew Bailey, who
replaced Mark Carney as head of the Bank of England on March 16, 2020,
to clarify the situation regarding the future [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the UK central
bank. Volatility during his speech usually rises sharply in the quotes
of the pound and the London Stock Exchange FTSE if Andrew Bailey gives
any hints of tightening or easing of the Bank of England's monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). He will probably also touch on the state and prospects of the
British economy, which has been badly affected by the coronavirus
pandemic and is on the verge of Brexit, which can still happen without a
deal.

If he does not touch upon the issues of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), the reaction to
his speech will be weak.

###  **Wednesday, September 23**

###  **01:30 AUD Retail Sales Index**

Retail Sales Index is published monthly by the Australian Bureau of
Statistics and measures total retail sales. The index is often
considered an indicator of consumer confidence and reflects the health
of the retail sector in the near term. Index growth is usually positive
for the AUD; a decrease in the indicator will negatively affect the AUD.
The previous value of the index (for July) was +3.2% after falling by
-17.7% in April. If the data for August turns out to be weaker than the
previous value, the AUD may sharply decline in the short term.

###  **02:00 NZD Decision of the RB of New Zealand on the interest rate.
Accompanying statement**

After the bank's management decided to cut the rate by 0.75% at an
unscheduled meeting on March 15, the current interest rate of the
Reserve Bank of New Zealand is at 0.25%. The bank's management explained
this decision by a loss of momentum in the New Zealand economy and a
sharp slowdown in the global economy amid the coronavirus pandemic.

"Global economic activity continues to weaken, reducing demand for goods
and services from New Zealand. Increased uncertainty and contraction in
international trade are contributing to a decline in economic growth in
trading partner countries," - said a recent statement of the RBNZ.

The RBNZ believes that wages growth remains weak. At the same time,
inflationary expectations are falling, and low levels of business
confidence indicate a slowdown in hiring and wages growth.

Restrained economic growth (New Zealand's GDP growth has slowed since
the second half of 2018) and a weakening labor market, as well as
escalating international trade wars and a worsening global economic
outlook are forcing the Reserve Bank of New Zealand to keep interest
rates low. An additional and unforeseen risk for the global and New
Zealand economies is the global coronavirus epidemic.

It is expected that at this meeting the RBNZ will not cut or increase
the rate yet, but may speak in favor of lowering it in the coming months
in case the economic situation in the country and in the world worsens.

In an accompanying statement, the RBNZ management will provide an
explanation of the decision on the interest rate and comments on the
economic conditions that contributed to this decision.

At this time, the volatility in the quotations of the New Zealand dollar
may rise sharply.

Earlier, the RBNZ stated that against the background of "many factors of
uncertainty" monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) "will remain soft for the foreseeable
future" but "can be adjusted accordingly." According to the bank's
management, for a stable recovery of the New Zealand economy and
inflation growth, "a lower rate of the New Zealand dollar is needed."

Probably, the head of the RBNZ Adrian Orr will reaffirm the bank's
intention to pursue a soft monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), which will lead to continued
pressure on the New Zealand currency.

###  **07:30 EUR Markit Economics Manufacturing PMI (preliminary
release). Markit Economics Composite PMI (preliminary release)**

Germany's Manufacturing PMI is an important indicator of the business
environment and the overall health of the German economy. This sector of
the economy forms a significant part of Germany's GDP. A result above 50
is seen as positive and strengthens the EUR, one below 50 as negative
for the euro. September forecast (preliminary release): 52.5.

Previous values: 52.2 in August, 51.0 in July, 45.2 in June, 36.6 in
May, 34.5 in April, 45.4 in March, 48 in February, 45.3 in January,
which indicates a continuing recovery in business activity in this
sector of the German economy, although the average value of the
indicator for several months is still below 50. The growth of the
indicator above the previous value and the value of 50 may support the
euro (in the short term). The data worse than the forecast will have a
negative impact on the euro.

Composite PMI of the German economy is an important indicator of the
business environment and the overall health of the German economy. A
result above 50 is seen as positive and strengthens the EUR, one below
50 as negative for the euro. Forecast for September (preliminary
release): 54.2 against 54.4 in August, 55.3 in July, 47.0 in June, 32.3
in May, 17.4 in April, 35 in March, 50.7 in February, 51.2 in January.
The publication of this indicator with the specified expected value is
likely to support the euro in the short term. The data worse than the
forecast and below the value of 50.0, as a rule, have a negative impact
on the euro.

###  **08:00 EUR Markit Economics Composite Manufacturing PMI
(preliminary release)**

Eurozone's Manufacturing PMI is an important indicator of the health of
the entire European economy. A result above 50 is considered positive
and strengthens the EUR, one below 50 - as negative for the euro.
Forecast for September (preliminary release): 51.7 (against 51.9 in
August, 54.9 in July, 48.5 in June, 31.9 in May, 13.6 in April, 29.7 in
March, 51 , 6 in February, 51.3 in January), which is likely to have a
positive effect on the euro. If the data turns out to be worse than the
forecast and the value of 50, then the euro may drop sharply in the
short term.

###  **08:30 GBP Markit Economics Services PMI (preliminary release)**

UK's Services PMI is an important indicator of the health of the UK
economy. The services sector employs most of the UK's working-age
population and accounts for approximately 78% of GDP. Financial services
are still the most important part of the services industry. If the data
turns out to be worse than the forecast and the previous value, the
pound is likely to drop sharply in the short term. The data better than
the forecast and the previous value will have a positive impact on the
pound. At the same time, a result above 50 is considered positive and
strengthens the GBP, one below 50 - as negative for the GBP.

Previous values ​​of the indicator: 58.8 in August, 56.5 in July, 47.1
in June, 29.0 in May, 13.4 in April, 34.5 in March, 53.2 in February,
53.9 in January. Preliminary forecast for September: 56.0.

###  **14:00 USD The Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's speech in Congress**

The Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will speak to Congress on economics and
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). His comments could affect both short-term and long-term
USD trading if he again touches on the Fed monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). A more
hawkish stance on the Fed's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) is seen as positive and
strengthening the US dollar, while a more cautious position is seen as
negative for the USD.

If he makes unexpected statements, the volatility in trading in the
financial markets may increase. Any hint by Powell about the need for an
even softer central bank [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) will cause the dollar to fall and
American stock markets to rise.

Financial market participants will carefully study his speech in order
to catch signals regarding the further actions of the Fed.

###  **23:50 JPY Bank of Japan Monetary Policy Committee Meeting**

At this meeting, the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Japan will
once again summarize the results of the last week's regular meeting of
the Bank, analyze the economic situation in Japan and give indications
on possible future prospects for the Bank of Japan's financial [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).

If the tone of the minutes of the meeting indicates the firmness of
intentions of the Bank of Japan regarding monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) in the
country, it will negatively affect the Japanese stock market and
strengthen the yen. Conversely, soft rhetoric about the bank's monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) prospects will help weaken the yen and boost the Japanese stock
market.

###  **Thursday, September 24**

###  **07:30 CHF SNB's decision on interest rate. SNB's statement on
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)**

The current deposit rate is in negative territory and amounts to -0.75%.
At the previous meeting in June, rates remained at the same level. The
central bank of Switzerland has consistently advocated a soft monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) in the country, and traditionally considers the rate of the
national currency "overvalued". Recently, the franc has largely lost its
status as a safe-haven currency, and the threat of intervention is
certainly holding back the franc from excessive growth. According to the
SNB executives, the franc is “still very overvalued” and intervention in
the foreign exchange market remains “an important means of maintaining
the low attractiveness of investments in francs and easing upward
pressure on the currency”.

Traders will also scrutinize the SNB's statement in order to pick up
signals regarding further monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) plans. The tough rhetoric of
the statement will strengthen the franc. The soft tone and intention to
continue the extra soft monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the SNB will negatively
affect the franc. High volatility is expected in the foreign exchange
market and, above all, in the franc trading, if the management of the
SNB makes unexpected statements.

###  **14:00 USD The Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's speech in Congress**

The Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will speak to Congress on economics and
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). His comments could affect both short-term and long-term
USD trading if he again touches on the Fed monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). A more
hawkish stance on the Fed's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) is seen as positive and
strengthening the US dollar, while a more cautious position is seen as
negative for the USD.

If he makes unexpected statements, the volatility in trading in the
financial markets may increase. Any hint by Powell about the need for an
even softer central bank [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) will cause the dollar to fall and
American stock markets to rise.

Financial market participants will carefully study his speech in order
to catch signals regarding the further actions of the Fed.

###  **Friday, September 25**

###  **12:30 USD Durable goods orders. Capital goods orders (ex defense
and aviation)**

This indicator reflects the value of orders received by manufacturers of
durable goods and capital goods (capital goods are durable commodities
used to produce durable goods and services), implying large investments.
Commodities produced in the defense and aviation sectors of the US
economy are not included in this indicator. A strong result strengthens
the USD. Previous values ​​of the indicator "orders for durable goods":
+11.4% in July, +7.7% in June, +15.0% in May, -18.3% in April, -16.7% in
March , +2.0% in February, -0.2% in January.

Previous values ​​of the indicator "orders for capital goods ex defense
and aviation": +1.9% in July, +4.3% in June, +1.5% in May, -6.6% in
April, -1.3% in March, -0.6% in February, +0.9% in January.

In theory, the relative growth of the indicator has a positive effect on
the dollar; the market reaction to its negative value may be negative
for the dollar in the short term. Data worse than the previous value
will also negatively affect the dollar quotes. Forecast for August:
+1.5% (orders for durable goods), +1.9% (orders for capital goods
excluding defense and aviation).

Despite the growth in indicators, this is probably still not enough to
cover their strong drop in March and April. Nevertheless, better-than-
expected data will have a short-term positive impact on the dollar.
