Short-term analysis for BTCUSD, XRPUSD, and ETHUSD for 10.08.2021Roman
Onegin

Dear readers,

I've prepared a short-term forecast for Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum
based on the Elliott wave analysis. Also, I've provided trading
recommendations and entry points for each cryptocurrency pair.

Bitcoin may correct down over the next trading session. Ethereum and
Ripple are expected to rise slightly and then correct down as well.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott Wave analysis for Bitcoin

 ****

The market continues moving in a large corrective wave [B], which is
developing as flat (A)-(B)-(C). The final part of the flat -- wave (C)
-- is forming at the moment. The wave (C) is an impulse made of 5 sub-
waves 1-2-3-4-5. The ultimate part of that formation -- impulse 5 -- is
developing now. Three fifths of the impulse 5 have already formed, so
there might be a corrective fall in a small corrective wave [4] to 44600
over the next trading session. This situation may suggest short-term
selling.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] for today:

Sell 45693.00, TP 44600.00

## Elliott Wave analysis for Ripple

 ****

A powerful bullish impulse is developing on the H1 chart of the crypto
pair XRPUSD. It consists of 5 sub-waves. The final part of that impulse
-- wave [5] -- is forming at the moment. The wave [5] is an impulse as
well where wave (3) is currently unfolding (marked with the blue
numeral). The market is likely to continue pushing above in wave 5 --
the ultimate part of the wave (3) -- in the next trading days. Thus, the
Ripple price may continue surging up to 0.853, and long positions can be
opened in the current situation.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] for today:

Buy 0.812, TP 0.853

* * *

## Elliott Wave analysis for Ethereum

 ****

The ETHUSD crypto pair is forming a strong bullish impulse, consisting
of sub-waves (1)-(2)-(3)-(4)-(5). It's almost completed. We only need to
wait for a green wave [5] to form in a red wave 3 in the final part of
the impulse (5), and the whole bullish trend will be fully completed.
The wave [5] is expected to end near resistance at 3280 in the short
term. Once the price reaches that level, the whole impulse 3 will have
formed, and corrective wave 4 will start developing. In the short term,
consider opening long positions with a target of 3280.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] for today:

Buy 3133.17, TP 3280.00
