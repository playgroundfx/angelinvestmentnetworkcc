Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 10.08.2021Alex
Rodionov

Hello, my fellow traders! Here's my forecast for US Crude, XAUUSD, and
EURUSD that I made using margin zones and classical technical analysis.
Based on this analysis, I made a list of entry signals for intraday
traders.

The gold price used downward momentum and reached the Gold zone 1764 –
1762 on non-farms last Friday.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil Forecast for today: USCrude analysis

Oil quotes reached the Gold zone of 65.70 - 65.43 yesterday. There was
heavy selling, and the price then corrected. Today, the first strong
resistance -- Additional Zone 66.50 - 66.38 -- was broken out. Thus, the
price is attempting to retest the next strong resistance, Additional
Zone 68.02 - 67.75.

Once the Additional Zone is reached, consider selling according to the
pattern as the short-term trend remains downward. The Gold zone will be
a selling target.

### Trading plan for [USCrude][1] for today:

Sell according to the pattern from Additional Zone 68.02 - 67.75.
TakeProfit: 65.30. StopLoss: According to pattern rules

## Gold forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

Gold continues following a short-term uptrend that started yesterday.
The price also corrected to Intermediary zone 1730 - 1727 yesterday. As
the price managed to settle in the zone, consider buying near that
support level. The Gold Zone 1755 - 1753 will be a buying target.

Alternative scenario: a breakout of the Intermediary zone and price
movement to the lower Target zone of 1707 - 1703. In that case, the
trend will turn down.

### Trading plan for [XAUUSD][2] for today:

Buy near the Intermediary zone 1730 - 1727. TakeProfit: Gold zone 1755 -
1753. StopLoss: 1722.

## Today’s forecast for the EURUSD: EURUSD analysis

The euro reached its main selling target within a short-term downtrend
-- the lower Target zone 1.1732 - 1.1715. Next, the trend will depend on
whether or not sellers can break through support and settle underneath.
If they can, consider new sales with a target in the Gold zone 1.1644 -
1.1635.

The EURUSD might correct today. If correction occurs, expect the price
to reach the following strong resistance levels: Additional zone 1.1780
- 1.1776 and Intermediary zone 1.1828 - 1.1820. New short positions can
be opened from those levels with a target set at the day's lowest.

### Trading plan for [EURUSD][3] for today:

  1. Sell according to the pattern from Additional Zone 1.1780 - 1.1776. TakeProfit: 1.1732. StopLoss: According to pattern rules
  2. Sell according to the pattern from Intermediary Zone 1.1828 - 1.1820. TakeProfit: 1.1732. StopLoss: According to pattern rules
