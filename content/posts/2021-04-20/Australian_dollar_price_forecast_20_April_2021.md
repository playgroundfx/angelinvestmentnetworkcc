Aussie's three advantages. Forecast as of 20.04.2021Dmitri Demidenko

If it hadn't been for the RBA, [AUDUSD][1] prices would have been
significantly higher than at present. Supported by iron ore, the labor
market, and investment expectations, the Aussie feels confident. Will
the AUD hit new highs? Let us discuss the Forex outlook and make up a
trading plan

## Monthly Australian dollar fundamental forecast

During the last meeting, the Reserve Bank noted that its monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
of keeping borrowing costs low contributed to the Aussie's weakening
rather than otherwise. If it were not for targeting the three-year
bonds' yield, the [AUDUSD][1] prices would have been significantly
higher than at present. The Aussie has too significant advantages.

Australia's geographical remoteness from the rest of the world and a
relatively low population density allowed Canberra to effectively fight
the pandemic. As a result, Australia became one of the first countries
to recover employment to pre-coronavirus levels. The March PMI data
showed that unemployment fell to 5.6%. The actual data turned out to be
better than the Bloomberg estimates, which allowed the [AUDUSD][1] bulls
to break out [the resistance at 0.767][2] and move towards the levels of
0.79 and 0.8.

A strong economy will attract investment and contribute to the
strengthening of the national currency. The US Research Center in Sydney
estimates that the 2020 uncertainty index has nearly doubled compared to
the 2019 average. As a result, gross investment flows fell to 50% lower
than the average for the past 5 years, including 2019. In 2021,
uncertainty will surely decrease, and money will flow back to Australia,
which allows [AUDUSD][1] bulls to be optimistic about the future.

Labor market recovery and potential capital inflows are not the Aussie's
only trump cards. Strong demand from China and supply problems pushed
the price of iron ore, a key component of Australian exports, to nearly
10-year highs. Brazil's company Vale produced less ore than expected in
the first quarter due to lower productivity at one of the mines and a
fire on a ship loader. Rio Tinto's shipments were interrupted due to
wetter-than-normal weather at its facilities in Western Australia. At
the same time, the [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) that refined steel production in China in March
rose by 19% YoY to an almost record high, pushed iron ore prices to the
highest level since May 2011.

Certainly, the [AUDUSD][1] price growth would not have happened if it
had not been for the weakening of the US dollar. Having lost support
from Treasury yields, the greenback cannot take advantage of strong US
macroeconomic statistics. The United States is perceived by [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s as
a driver of global growth, so whatever is good for the US is good for
the world economy and countries with higher debt market rates.

### Monthly [AUDUSD][1] trading plan

In my opinion, the targets at 0.79 and 0.8 indicated [in the previous
article][3] remain relevant. Aussie is far from exhausting its
potential. It has been profitable to enter trades on the breakout of the
resistnace at 0.767. I recommend holding and adding up to [AUDUSD][1]
long positions on the corrections.
