General Electric Forecast: 2021 and BeyondJana Kane

The pandemic created an unfortunate environment for many companies,
General Electric included. And since GE is best known for its work in
the Power, Renewable Energy, Aviation, and Healthcare industries, these
headwinds may take time to slow down. But is it also the [best time](https://www.fixpro.org/post/forex-best-time-to-trade/) to
make an investment in the GE stock?

Let’s take a close look at the General Electric stock price prediction
and analyst recommendations to settle one issue. Will GE stock price
continue to rally, and should you invest in 2021?

## Overview of the GE Stock Price Over the Years

General Electric is one of the nation’s oldest giants and most enduring
companies. It shows a solid, long-term track record as one of the top
stocks and quickly found its way to the Dow Jones index, staying there
for more than 100 years. The company has transformed over the decades,
bringing its stock price for the ride.

In August 2000, the company reached a 601 billion USD market cap,
becoming the most valuable company in the world. This was also roughly
the period for its all-time high - [$60][1].

In June 2018, the stock was removed from the Dow Jones index. This was
prompted by the fact that [GE][3] was one of the worst-performing stocks
in the index, falling more than 60% year over year.

Since then, the company has endured a roller-coaster ride of volatility
that’s been pretty disappointing. The stock has started to recover only
in the third quarter of last year and might be slowly regaining its
strong position in the market.

## General Electric Stock Price: Where Is It Now?

Now that you know some background information, take a look at the GE
current price.

At the end of February, the GE stock price reached its highest level in
more than two years. After that, the rise has eased a bit. But despite
the drop, General Electric is still on the right path, and the overall
progress is undeniable.

It allows us to believe in further progress down the line.

## Expert Predictions on the GE Stock Price in 2021

For our General Electric share price forecast for 2021 and investment
ratings, we decided to look at analysts.

### Markus Mittermaier, UBS

[Markus Mittermaier ][4]has raised his General Electric price target to
[$17][5] a share, up from $15. That is the highest call among analysts
tracked by Bloomberg that follow the stock.

### Joshua Pokrzywinski, Morgan Stanley

[Joshua Pokrzywinski][6] noted that there’s a lot of room to grow in
Aviation. This compelling argument for profitable business resulted in a
buy rating and the target of [$17][7].

### John Walsh, Credit Suisse

[John Walsh][8] maintained a Hold rating on GE and a realistic price
target of [$13.][9] In his own words, it takes a village to understand
General Electric and assess the turnaround.

### Andrew Kaplowitz, Citigroup

[Andrew Kaplowitz][10] believes the long-term potential for [GE
stock][3] is significant. His current signal is to buy, and in March, he
reiterated the base target that he shared previously - [$14][11].

## Technical Analysis of General Electric Stocks

Let’s start the technical analysis by looking at the summary based on
the most popular technical indicators - Moving Averages, Oscillators,
and Pivots - on the 1-day chart.

 _Source:[Trading View][12]        _

GE has been trading on an uptrend. This longer bullish period conveys
that the shorter-period uptrend is strong and [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/)ly backed. If
the current trend continues, GE may pass its high of November 2017 at
around $19 by the end of the year.

The bar chart features Moving Average lines, including the 10-day,
3-day, and 50-day. The 30-day MA has moved back above the 50-day and
below the-10 day, indicating a bullish trend in the short term. The
current uptrend also shows multiple bounces off the 10-day MA, proving
the bullish view on the projected stock price.

## General Electric (GE) Price Prediction for 2022

Now, let’s start with the first General Electric stock price prediction.
According to Wallet Investor, we won’t be seeing intense stock
performance next year. GE might experience minor price changes without
leaving the $12 threshold.

The further we go, the harder it is to make accurate stock market
predictions. So, opinions for 2030 don't feature the same detailed
table. [Coin Price Forecast][16] subscribed to the same idea as given by
Gov Capital. The next 10 years might drive the GE price to $77-$79 in
value.

## General Electric: Historical Stock Quote Prices

We can’t fully gauge GE’s future price until we look at its [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/)
price performance. That said, we won’t be covering it year by year. Take
a look at the chart below to gain a basic understanding of the price
over the decades.

 _Source:[Trading View][17]_

Now, as for the more recent developments, here is the timeline with some
notable events:

  * 2000: Four stock splits into August’s all-time high.

  * 2008: The stock fell 42% during the financial crisis, and Warren Buffett famously stepped in by investing $3 billion to stabilize GE’s operations. Still, the stock plunged to around $8 by the end of the same year.

  * 2009-2016: Major acquisitions (Electrolux, Alstom Power, Vital Signs Inc., etc.) and a slow rise to around $30 occurred.

 ****

 _Source:[Trading View][17]_

  * 2017-2019: Some of its worst years in the recent price [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/). By the end of 2019, shares had fallen to around $6 since January 2017, when the company announced it would cut 12,000 jobs.

  * 2020: There were huge layoffs during the pandemic, and GE’s aviation unit was specifically impacted.  

  * Late 2020-2021: There was improved Wall Street sentiment, better-than-expected earnings, new projects, such as Vineyard Wind. The price has more than doubled, surpassing the 13-dollars mark.

## What Can Drive the GE Stock Price: Factors to Consider

The following factors may be the reason for its growth; at the same
time, some of them might have a negative effect:

  *  **U.S. economic stimulus package.** Biden’s $1.9 trillion [American Rescue Plan][18] alone is larger than most countries’ annual economic output. This recession is likely to leave smaller scars than the 2008 global financial crisis, indirectly making a positive impact on [General Electric][3].

  *  **Changes in the power-generation industry.** GE is making a huge change to its business by moving away from high-carbon technologies like coal projects. The [transition][19] into low-cost, zero-pollution energy is an important step as power remains a key source of sales for GE. 

  *  **Commercial aircraft market.** The dramatic drop in demand for passenger air transport put General Electric in a tough spot. But the recent [$30 billion deal][20] with AerCap, roughly doubling its fleet, gives GE a significant competitive advantage.

  *  **Index inclusion.** For example, the [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) of inclusion into Nasdaq 100 and the actual inclusion itself might generate a [significant increase][21] in the stock price. Currently, General Electric is a component of major US indices, such as S&P 500, S&P Industrial, S&P 100, and the NYSE Arca Major Market Index. 

## Is General Electric Stock a Good Buy?

General Electric said last month that industrial revenues would grow
organically in the low-single-digit range. The statement was supported
and even surpassed by the stock’s six-month gain at around 98%.
Therefore, the General Electric stock forecast suggests a very good move
in the future.

The stock will continue to climb, but there will be drops in the share
price at intervals as GE continues a long, arduous turnaround process.
So, it’s a buy.
