Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 20.04.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

Yesterday, the euro reached Target Zone 2 1.2040 - 1.2024 within a
short-term uptrend.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

WTI oil's Friday high was updated today. Traders are now trying to
consolidate the price above the resistance level of 63.81. If
successful, the next target will be the Gold Zone 65.55 - 65.30.

It is reasonable to consider oil purchases on correction at strong
supports. The key support is the Additional Zone 62.97 - 62.84. As long
as this zone is held by traders, wait for a pattern to enter a long
trade. As soon as the zone is broken out, consider oil sales down to the
Intermediary Zone 61.69 - 61.44.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

Buy according to the pattern in Additional Zone 62.97 - 62.84.
TakeProfit: Gold Zone 65.55 - 65.30. StopLoss: according to the pattern
rules.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

Yesterday, gold traders failed to break out the Target Zone 1782 - 1777.
As a result, a correction can be seen now while the price is approaching
the trend key support 1765 - 1762.

After the key support test, start looking for purchases according to the
pattern. The target for purchases will be level 1788.

The closing of the price below level 1762 at the US trading session is
required for sales. In this case, the short-term trend will reverse
down, and the target will be the lower Target Zone 1740 - 1735.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

Buy according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 1765 - 1762.
TakeProfit: 1788. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

Yesterday, the euro reached Target Zone 2 1.2040 - 1.2024 within a
short-term uptrend. Today, the traders are trying to break out TZ 2. If
the price closes higher at the US session, the next growth target will
be Gold Zone 2 1.2112 - 1.2104.

In case of EURUSD price correction, look for new purchases according to
the pattern in the Additional Zone 1.2027 - 1.2023. The target will be
level 1.2066.

In case of the Additional Zone breakout, there will be an opportunity to
start selling with the target in the Intermediary Zone 1.1983 - 1.1975.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

Buy according to the pattern in Additional Zone 1.2027 - 1.2023.
TakeProfit: 1.2066. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.
