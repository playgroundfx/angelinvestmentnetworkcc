Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 20.04.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

All cryptocurrency pairs covered in the article continue forming
descending double zigzags.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

The most recent BTCUSD chart section displays the bearish double zigzag
W-X-Y currently unfolding. Sub-wave W has completed as a triple zigzag.
There is now forming the linking wave X, which is likely to be a double
zigzag [W]-[X]-[Y]. The down wave [X] must have competed, so the price
should be soon rising in the zigzag-shaped wave [Y], as it is outlined
in the chart. The entire wave X could end at a level around 61200.00,
where wave X will retrace the W wave by 76.4%.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 54870.00, TP 61200.00

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

In the most recent chart section, there is forming the corrective down
wave [2] as a regular zigzag (A)-(B)-(C). Wave (A) looks like a leading
diagonal. There is now developing corrective wave (B), which could
finish as a double zigzag W-X-Y. The first two legs of the zigzag must
have finished, so the market should be forming the final zigzag-shaped
wave Y, as it is outlined in the chart. The entire wave (B) should
complete at a level of 1.770, where the (B) wave will be 76.4% of wave
(A). One could enter long trades in the current situation.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] today:

Buy 1.283, TP 1.770

## Elliott wave Ethereum analysis

Like the BTCUSD, the ETHUSD market is developing a double zigzag, with
the middle leg, the linking upwave (X), forming inside. The (X) wave
should be unfolding as a double zigzag W-X-Y. Presumably, the down wave
X has finished, and the price should be rising in the Y zigzag. The
market could be going up to a level of 2400.00, where wave (X) will be
76.4% of wave (W).

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Buy 2115.12, TP 2400.00
