Silver stops at nothing. Forecast as of 04.05.2021Dmitri Demidenko

After the manufacturing sector had ceased supporting the XAGUSD bulls,
they gave up on it. Now, silver has different growth drivers. What will
determine the [XAGUSD][1] trend? Let us discuss the Forex outlook and
make up a trading plan.

## Weekly silver fundamental forecast

Silver has had the best [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) rally since February 1st amid a downturn
in the ISM US manufacturing sector index from 64.7 to 60.7. As the
industrial demand makes up a substantial share in aggregate silver
demand, silver was outperforming gold in 2020 amid a rapid rebound of
the industry compared to the services sector. However, a decline in the
manufacturing PMI resulted in the XAGUSD growth! Is it a paradox? In no
way! Like any other trading asset, the silver price is determined by
many factors. The [XAGUSD][1] is quite responsive to financial markets.

In May, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s again like the idea of commodities super-cycle. Iron
ore has hit a record high; copper is growing in value, the demand for
oil and other assets is also increasing. The commodity prices are
booming amid massive monetary stimulus and the global demand recovery.
Economic expansion is expected in the world's leading economies for the
remainder of the year. The euro area, the UK, and other countries are
likely to join China and the United States, which pushes up commodity
prices and increases the risk of inflation acceleration. Furthermore,
the Fed’s passive attitude, which is willing to put up with the
overheating of the US economy, results in the Treasury real yields,
supporting the growth of gold and other precious metals.

In this regard, a slowdown in the US manufacturing PMI is seen as a
signal that the US economy hasn’t fully recovered, and the Fed should
continue to pour cheap liquidity into the financial system, supporting
the [XAGUSD][1] appreciation. Furthermore, the greenback outlook seems
to be bear amid the massive monetary expansion, so I can say that the
further silver trend is clear. I wonder if the silver price will break
through its all-time high of $50 per ounce reached ten years ago. In my
opinion, the chance is rather low.

Although the Silver Institute expects metal demand in 2021 to rise to
its highest level since 2015, [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/) capital inflows will slow from 331.1
Moz to 150 Moz, bringing the deficit from 251 Moz to 126 .7 Moz.

However, it must be understood that the market is constantly changing.
Nobody knows when the market will change, but it will. Although the Fed
is repeating its mantra about a temporary surge in inflation and its
willingness to put up with the economy overheating, it will have to
unwind monetary stimulus at some point. According to research by BofA
Merrill Lynch, the world’s leading central banks should reduce the
monetary stimulus volume from $9 trillion to $3.4 trillion in 2021. It
will drop to $0.4 trillion in 2022. When large buyers leave the market,
the price of bonds falls, and their yield rises. The bond yield rally is
the primary bearish factor for both gold and silver.

### Weekly [XAGUSD][1] trading plan

Unless the US strong jobs report triggers Treasury yields growth, one
could buy silver with the target at $28.4 and $30.1 per ounce.
Otherwise, the bond yields rally could strengthen the dollar and press
down the silver price to at least the support at $26.1.
