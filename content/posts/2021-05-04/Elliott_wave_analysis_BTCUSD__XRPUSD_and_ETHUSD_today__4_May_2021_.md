Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 04.05.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

Ethereum seems to have finished forming the global impulse wave, so
there should soon start a new bear trend.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

The BTCUSD is developing the beginning of the impulse down wave. The
first leg, wave 1, has completed as a five-wave impulse. The upward
corrective wave 2 must have also completed as a double zigzag
[W]-[X]-[Y]. If so, there is unfolding a new bearish wave. The price
should be declining to a level below the low of 47000.00, marked by wave
1.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Sell 55857.50, TP 47000.00

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

After the corrective down wave [2] finished, the Ripple price has
started rising in the impulse wave, composed of the sub-waves
(1)-(2)-(3)-(4)-(5). There has completed impulse 1 made up of the sub-
waves 1-2-3-4-5. Correction (2) also seems to have completed. The market
should continue rising to a level above the high of 1.961, marked by a
large impulse [1]. One could enter purchases in the current situation.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] today:

Buy 1.485 TP 1.961

## Elliott wave Ethereum analysis

The upward impulse wave C must have completed. Therefore, there is
unfolding the initial section of the new bear trend. The ETHUSD market
should be moving to a level of 2730.00, marked by correction [4]. Next,
the price should continue declining to lower levels. One could enter
short positions in the current situation.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Sell 3358.81, TP 2730.00
