USD/JPY forecast: will the yen open a window to economyDmitri Demidenko

## Fundamental Yen forecast for today

### The gap between Japan and US bond yields will give a clue on USD/JPY
future price trend

Before the recession, it was beneficial to trade the [USD/JPY][1] on the
U.S. economic [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/). The BoJ’s yield curve control [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), in fact, left
the Japanese government bonds out of the game as the JGB yields remained
the same. The US positive domestic data widened the yield gap, which
strengthened the US dollar. A narrower spread between the yields on the
Treasuries and the JGB encouraged the yen bulls to go ahead. The
pandemic and global recession changed the game rules. Will [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s
play again?

The drop of the US stock indexes in March, followed by the Fed’s
monetary expansion, sent the Treasury yields down by 130 basis points to
the all-time lows. Analysts started discussing the introduction of the
negative interest rates by the Fed. The yield on Japan’s bonds, amid the
BoJ [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) and limited foreign demand, is stable close to zero. So, it
is different from global trends. Since the beginning of 2020, the
negative-yielding debts have been 40% up, to $16 trillion.

### Dynamics of US and Japan’s bond yields

More and more experts say Treasuries can’t be a window into the economy
as before. The US Treasuries often ignore the US domestic data, they are
obviously overbought. Furthermore, buyers are discouraged by the talks
about the growing bond issue amid the expansion of the fiscal stimulus
and the selloffs of Treasuries by China. The bond price is inversely
proportional to its yield. Therefore, selling on the secondary market
before auctions or diversifying FX reserves drives the price down, which
increases the interest rates.

A stable yield-gap between Treasuries and JGB is a reason to expect the
[USD/JPY][1] consolidation in the range of 104-108. The Bank of Japan is
not interested in the yen’s strengthening, as it hopes to drive
inflation to its 2% target. So, the yen is now more interesting to trade
against other currencies rather than the US dollar. It is rather
sensitive to the US-China conflict, which turns from a trade battle into
a real ideological war.

According to Mitsui Bank, further deterioration in the US-China
relations will weaken the greenback in the short run. However, it will
hurt the entire global economy in the long-term. I believe the conflict
escalation will allow selling the [AUD/JPY][3] with targets at 74.9 and
73.7 and selling the [NZD/JPY][4] with targets at 69.3 and 68.6.
However, if the if opponents won’t go further than mutual closures of
consulates or sanctions against individual officials, I will stick to my
former scenario of the [EUR/JPY][1] longs opened at [the level of
122][5]. Furthermore, I added up to the purchases on the [breakout of
the resistance at 124][6]. Unless Europe is shocked by the second wave
of the pandemic, the trading ideas are relevant.
