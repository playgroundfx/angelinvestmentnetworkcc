Short-term forecast for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 18.11.2020Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for day traders.

The gold price is being corrected up in the medium-term downtrend.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

Nothing has changed in the medium-term oil price chart. The middle-term
uptrend continues; the target is in Target Zone 2 [44.22 — 43.71].

The short-term oil trend is down. Yesterday, sellers drove the price
back under the resistance Additional Zone [41.32 – 41.20] and drew a
1-2-3 pattern to sell.

Today, I recommend entering short trades according to this pattern with
a stop loss above yesterday’s high.

If the price starts rising and the trade is exited with a stop loss, we
shall look for another pattern to sell in the short-term downtrend's key
resistance [42.63 — 42.39].

### [USCrude ][1]trading ideas for today:

  1. Sell at the current prices. TakeProfit: 40.05. StopLoss: 41.73.

  2. Sell according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone [42.63 - 42.39]. TakeProfit: 40.05. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

Gold price is being corrected up in the middle-term downtrend. Good
prices to sell gold are in the zone of [1976.9 — 1965.4], which is far
from the current prices.

Let us look at the short-term gold price chart. The gold price is being
corrected up in the short-term downtrend. The correction target is to
test the key resistance Intermediary Zone [1913.6 – 1907.9].

Today, I suggested expecting the price to grow up to IZ. After IZ is
tested, we shall look for a sell pattern. If there is a sell pattern, we
should sell gold with the target to break through the low of last week.

If the price breaks out IZ upside, the short-term trend will turn up,
and the buy target will be the upper Target Zone [1976.9 — 1965.4].

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

Sell according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone [1913.6 - 1907.9].
TakeProfit: 1850.0. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

EURUSD is running up in the middle-term uptrend. The upside target is
Target Zone 2 [1.2032 - 1.2012]. I recommend entering purchases at good
prices. The trend key support is in the zone of [1.1688 — 1.1665].

There is a contradiction in the short-term EURUSD price chart. The
short-term euro trend is down. The sell target is the low of last week +
Target Zone [1.1688 – 1.1665].

Yesterday, traders were testing the trend key resistance [1.1873 –
1.1861]. The zone wasn’t broken out; the US session closed the price
within the resistance zone.

Today, we continue looking for a sell entry according to the pattern.
The pattern will emerge when the price breaks through the low of
November 16.

An alternative scenario to buy the euro will be relevant if the bulls
break out IZ and consolidate the price above.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

Sell according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone [1.1873 - 1.1861].
TakeProfit: 1.1747, Target Zone [1.1688 - 1.1665]. StopLoss: according
to the pattern rules.
