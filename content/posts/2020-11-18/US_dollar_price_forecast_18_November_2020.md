Dollar plays in a draw. Forecast as of 18.11.2020Dmitri Demidenko

While the Federal Reserve and the US stock market are trying to
determine the US economic situation and its outlook, the [EURUSD][1] is
rising. The euro bulls ignore the pandemic, and it is scary. Let us
discuss the Forex outlook and make up a trading plan.

##  **Weekly US dollar fundamental forecast**

What is right? Central banks or financial markets? They are in a draw so
far. The stock indices suggested a recession, while the Fed’s officials
claimed that the US economy was strong and the downturn was unlikely.
The Fed had underestimated the pandemic impact. However, the Federal
Reserve took urgent measures and stabilized the economic situation. The
[S&P 500][2] rally in the March-September period suggested a V-shaped
recovery of the US GDP, while Jerome Powell complained that it would
take a long time to return to the pre-crisis levels. In November, the US
stock market hits fresh highs, while the Fed’s Chairman warns that the
next few months should be tough for the US economy. What is right this
time, the stock market or the Fed?

Jerome Powell worries that people will lose confidence in efforts to
combat COVID-19 and abandon activities that they believe could put them
at risk of infection. This is what takes place already. Yes, progress in
the development of vaccines is good [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) in the medium-term outlook, but
it will take a long time to reach full economic recovery. Common sense
suggests the Fed’s Chair is right. The second pandemic wave turns the
economic downturn from a shock into a long-term recession worsened by
the uncertainty. Furthermore, the mass vaccination of the population
will take many months. What about the [S&P 500][2] record highs?

The paradox is that the US stock market rally results from the …Fed’s
actions. The huge injections of liquidity have confused [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s.
Investors used to prefer cash, which sent the stock market down. But
next, they rushed to spend the money buying stocks. The [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) about
vaccines just gave the speculators another reason to buy. The matter is
what is behind the [S&P 500][2] bulls’ optimism and how soon they will
regain consciousness.

If we let alone the US stock market's crazy rally, we should realize
that the US economy performs better than the euro-area. Yes, the US
industrial production is 5.6% lower than before the pandemic; yes, the
retail sales in October grew at the lowest rate over the last six
months; yes, the number of new COVID cases has soared to 166,000 per
day. However, the mortality rate in the euro-area is rising, making the
euro-area governments impose restrictions.

### Weekly [EURUSD][1] trading plan

The euro-area economy was already weak before the pandemic. It had
several problems, including low inflation and low exports because of the
US-China trade war. In the third quarter, the euro-area economy was
recovering faster than the US. However, the euro area could face a
double-dip recession in the October-December period. Under such
circumstances, the [EURUSD][1] rally looks strange, to say the least.
The euro rally should soon end unless the [S&P 500][2] continues rising.
If the pair goes below the zone of 1.184-1.1845, it will be relevant to
sell the euro against the dollar.

On the other hand, speculators could go on buying without any
fundamental reasons. The Fed's cheap money encourages traders to buy
assets now, as the prices could grow later. Emotions rule the market,
and it looks scary.
