Pound: two steps forward, one step back. Forecast as of 21.10.2021Dmitri
Demidenko

Andrew Bailey's hawkish stance made the markets believe the interest
rate could rise to 1.25% in 2022 and encouraged the [GBPUSD][1] bulls to
go ahead. How will it end? Let us discuss the market outlook and make up
a trading plan.

## Weekly pound fundamental forecast

Tightening monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) is usually compared with taking away a cup of
punch at the height of a feast. However, what kind of feast can we talk
about in the UK? Bloomberg experts reduce their GDP growth forecast for
2021 by 0.4 pps to 5.1%, which is the worst among European economies.
The country is drowning in an energy crisis, and the Treasury is going
to raise taxes by £12 billion. The BoE's intention to raise rates looks
even more surprising. Rumors about which became the catalyst for a rally
in [GBPUSD][1] by almost 3% from the levels of the September bottom.

Until about a month ago, money markets did not expect the interest rate
to rise until June 2022. However, the fastest acceleration of inflation
in the UK since the Bank of England has been granted operational
independence over monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) in 1997 has forced money markets to
reconsider their views. Although consumer prices slowed down in
September from 3.2% to 3.1% YoY, it doesn't change a thing. According to
Andrew Bailey, the energy issue means that the period of high
inflationary pressure will last longer than currently expected, and BoE
will have to act to keep price growth under control.

Such a hawkish stance of the BoE head alarmed the financial markets. As
a result, the yield on 2-year British bonds, sensitive to changes in
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), rose sharply, and [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s postponed their interest
rate hike forecasts for November. Moreover, the Bank of England may
start the second part of the monetary restriction in December or
February, so by the end of 2022 borrowing costs will jump to 1.25%. A
sharp reassessment of the rate trajectory led to a rapid pound
strengthening against major world currencies. However, isn't BoE making
a political mistake?

The BoE's willingness to save face is understandable. Yes, monetary
tightening can’t solve the problem of supply disruptions or press down
gas prices, but it can curb inflationary expectations. The latter has
been the highest since 2008. The UK private sector employers expect to
raise wages from 1.6% in the previous year to 2.5% by August 2022,
according to XpertHR. Therefore, high inflation pressure is likely to
remain for a long time.

After all, the BoE can well raise the interest rate and follow with a
rate cut if the pace of consumer price growth starts to slow down. At
least, the inverted interest-rate-swaps curve proves this idea.
Investors believe the interest rate will peak to 1.25% in 12-18 months
and drop to 1% by 2025.

### Weekly [GBPUSD][1] trading plan

History shows that there is a great difference between a word and a
deed. The BoE has convinced the market of its willingness to hike the
Bank rate in November. However, if it does not start tightening its
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) at the next meeting, it could result in a massive
[GBPUSD][1] sell-off. One could consider buying the pair, even if it
breaks through October highs when it consolidates above level 1.379.
