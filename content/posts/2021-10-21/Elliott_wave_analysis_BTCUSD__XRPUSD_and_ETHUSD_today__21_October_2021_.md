Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 21.10.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

Bitcoin and Ethereum might have started forming new bearish trends.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

The BTCUSD must have finished forming the global corrective wave [B]
composed of sub-waves (A)-(B)-(C). If so, the market should shortly
start declining in the new bearish trend. Therefore, one could enter
short trades. The first target is at the low of 59800.00, marked by
correction [4].

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Sell 65073.50, TP 59800.00

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

The XRPUSD market continues forming the linking wave X composed of three
sub-waves [A]-[B]-[C]. There is unfolding the final sub-wave [C], namely
its final sub-wave (5). Wave (5) has been half-complete, so the Ripple
price should continue rising to a level of 1.236. One could enter buy
trades in the current situation.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] **** today:

Buy 1.143, TP 1.236

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

The ETHUSD price chart displays the structure of the corrective wave B,
which must have already completed. Its final leg [C] is a five-wave
impulse (1)-(2)-(3)-(4)-(5). Therefore, the market should be declining
in the next few days, having started a new bearish trend. The first
downside target is at the previous low around 3670.00, marked by
correction 4. One could enter sell trades in the current situation.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Sell 4180.82, TP 3670.00
