Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 21.10.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

The first target for euro purchases in the Additional Zone yielded
profits, that is, the level of 1.1666 has been reached.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

During yesterday's oil trading session, level 81.13 was tested again.
The level was held by buyers. As a result, the short-term uptrend
continued, the October 18 high was updated and the Gold Zone 82.64 -
82.38 was broken out. Now the next target within the trend is the Target
Zone 2 85.44 - 84.93.

At the moment, the oil price is correcting and approaching the
Additional Zone 82.42 - 82.30. The AZ is a strong support, therefore,
first of all, look for new purchases in it according to the pattern.
Today's high serves as the first buy target, the second buy target is
Target Zone 2.

If the Additional Zone is broken out downside and the price consolidates
below, it will be possible to enter sales with the target at level 81.13
within the correction.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

  1. Buy according to the pattern in Additional Zone 82.42 - 82.30. TakeProfit: 83.61. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.
  2. Sell on retest when the Additional Zone is broken out downside. TakeProfit: 81.13. StopLoss: beyond the local high.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

The short-term gold trend reversed up. Yesterday, the price closed above
the Intermediary Zone 1780 - 1779 at the US trading session. Now the
upper Target Zone 1801 - 1797 serves as the growth target. It is
reasonable to enter gold purchases in the zone of 1780 - 1768.

The Intermediary Zone 1770 - 1768 serves as the border of the short-term
uptrend. If it is broken out downside and the price closes below the
zone at the US session, the short-term trend will reverse down. In this
case, it is reasonable to enter gold sales with a target in the lower
Target Zone 1751 - 1748.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

Buy in the zone of 1780 - 1768. TakeProfit: Target Zone 1801 - 1797.
StopLoss: 1764.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

The first target for euro purchases in the Additional Zone yielded
profits, that is, the level of 1.1666 has been reached. The next target
within the trend is the upper Target Zone 1.1718 - 1.1700. Breakout of
level 1.1666 will make it possible to reach the second buy target.

The trend key support is shifting to level 1.1622. A breakout of this
level downside and the price consolidation below will contribute to the
short-term's reversal down. In this case, consider euro sales with a
target at the level of 1.1576.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

  1. Hold up a part of purchases entered in Additional Zone 1.1625 - 1.1620. TakeProfit: Target Zone 1.1718 - 1.1700. StopLoss: at breakeven.

  2. Buy according to the pattern in Additional Zone 1.1622 - 1.1619. TakeProfit: Target Zone 1.1718 - 1.1700. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.
