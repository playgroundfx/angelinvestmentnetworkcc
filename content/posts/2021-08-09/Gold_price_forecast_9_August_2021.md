Gold's collapse. Forecast as of 09.08.2021Dmitri Demidenko

When there are too many buyers in the market, the [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) that can scare
them can trigger a series of sales. This has happened to other assets.
[XAUUSD][1] is no exception. Let us analyze the gold outlook and make up
a trading plan

## Monthly gold fundamental forecast

For a long time, there have been no flash crashes in the foreign
exchange and commodity markets. Traders have missed them. I remember how
in January 2019 the Japanese yen soared against the Australian dollar by
8% in a few minutes during the "witching hour", the time during the
Asian session when Americans are getting ready for bed, while their
colleagues from Japan and other Eastern countries are waking up.
Liquidity is low, and there are many opportunities to provoke a sharp
price movement. Roughly the same thing happened to gold and the entire
precious metals market the next working morning after the publication of
strong US employment data.

August is not in vain called a dangerous month for [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s. Many of
them go on vacation and take money away with them. Liquidity is
shrinking, and some major traders have the opportunity to rock the
market boat. Moreover, the latest reports on traders' bonds showed an
increase in speculative net longs for gold by 1%, and for silver by a
considerable 22%. As a result, an increase in employment by 943 thousand
in July forced asset managers, who recently entered long trades, to
hurry to close them. Sales also increased due to the big number of stop
orders. As a result, [XAUUSD][1] sank by 4%, and [XAGUSD][2] by 7%!

### Dynamics of gold speculative positions

At first glance, traders had reasons to buy precious metals. Rise of the
base PCE up to 3.5% (the 30 years' high), the fall in real Treasury
yields to historic lows, and the rise in the global debt market to $16.5
trillion, which is trading at negative rates, would seem to make
[XAUUSD][1] buyers feel confident. Only the US dollar could have created
problems, but the slow normalization of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) by the Fed
should theoretically have created problems for the USD.

The reality turned out to be different, but only those who firmly
believed in what was written in textbooks on fundamental analysis were
disappointed. In fact, the claim that gold is a hedge against inflation
is highly questionable. Since US President Richard Nixon refused to
convert dollars into precious metals at a fixed rate of $35 per ounce in
1971, its ratio to CPI has fluctuated from 1 to 8.4. Today, gold looks
too expensive for inflation: the coefficient is 6.5 with an average of
3.6 over 50 years.

investments in gold and securities

Investors believed in the mantra that precious metals can hedge
inflation risks because in the 1970s both gold and CPI were growing
rapidly. However, later the connection stopped.

### Monthly gold trading plan

I have long said that gold is not driven by inflation, but by what the
Fed thinks about inflation, and also how the markets assess the central
bank's position. Strong employment and CPI data contributed to the
establishment of the [XAUUSD][1] bearish trend. In this regard, I
recommend hold short trades entered [at level of $1793 per ounce][3] and
add up to them on corrections.
