Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 09.08.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

Most likely, crypto markets have not yet completed the development of
large corrective sub-waves. Thus, all three cryptocurrencies covered in
the article should be rising in prices in the near future.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

Bitcoin is supposed to continue to form an upward corrective wave [B] as
a simple zigzag (A) - (B) - (C). In the third decade of July, a bearish
correction (B) in the form of a triple zigzag was completed, followed by
BTC price rise in a bullish wave (C). The internal structure of wave (C)
suggests the development of a simple five-wave impulse 1-2-3-4-5. As
part of this impulse, waves 1-2-3-4 are fully completed, and wave 5 is
half-formed. Most likely, soon, the price will rise to the level of
47000.00 within the sub-wave [3], and then the development of the
remaining two sub-waves [4] - [5] will begin, as shown in the chart.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 43553.00, TP 47000.00

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

The XRPUSD market continues to develop a large linking wave (X), which
consists of sub-waves A-B-C. The hourly timeframe of the XRPUSD chart
displays the final section of the bearish correction B, which is a
triple zigzag. The internal structure of upward wave C can also be seen,
which is an impulse, but not yet finished. For its completion, a sub-
wave is required [5]. In the near future, the price may rise to the
level of 0.853, where the sub-wave (3) will be completed. Then the
development of the last two parts, sub-waves (4) - (5), will begin as
shown in the chart.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] **** today:

Buy 0.776, TP 0.853

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

The ETHUSD market, as well as the BTCUSD market, is forming a large
upward corrective wave B as a simple zigzag [A] - [B] - [C]. The bullish
impulse wave [C] is developing. There have finished four parts – sub-
waves (1) - (2) - (3) - (4). The last upward wave (5), which is
developing as an impulse, is only half completed. Shortly, the price
should be rising in sub-wave 3 to level 3280.00. One could enter long
trades in the current situation.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Buy 2932.72, TP 3280.00
