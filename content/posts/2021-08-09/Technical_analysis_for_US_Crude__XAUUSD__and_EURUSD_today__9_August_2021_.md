Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 09.08.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

Last Friday, as part of the downward impulse within nonfarm payrolls,
the gold price reached the Gold Zone 1764 - 1762.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

Today oil trades opened with a gap within the short-term downtrend. Due
to the gap, the last week's low was updated and the Target Zone 68.43 -
67.88 was broken out. Now the price is trying to test the Gold Zone
65.70 - 65.43.

It is reasonable to enter new oil sales on correction at strong
resistance levels. Additional Zone 67.86 - 67.72 and Intermediary Zone
69.36 - 69.08 are strong resistances today. The latter serves as the
trend border.

As a sales target, focus primarily on the day's low, and then on the
Gold Zone.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

  1. Sell according to the pattern in Additional Zone 67.86 - 67.72. TakeProfit: 66.38. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. Sell according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 69.36 - 69.08. TakeProfit: 66.38. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

Last Friday, as part of the downward impulse within nonfarm payrolls,
the gold price reached the Gold Zone 1764 - 1762. After the opening of
trades this morning, the downtrend continued. Within this trend, the
Target Zone 3 1696 - 1692 has been reached.

After reaching the Target Zone 3, the price reversed and broke out the
Intermediary Zone 1710 - 1708 and then the new Target Zone 1735 - 1730.
Now the gold is trying to test the new Gold Zone 1755 - 1753.

As part of the short-term uptrend, enter gold purchases on correction.
At the moment, strong supports are at levels 1735 and 1723.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

Buy according to the patterns in the levels of 1735 and 1723.
TakeProfit: 1755 - 1753. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

The euro broke out the Intermediary Zone 1.1820 - 1.1811. The short-term
trend reversed down last Friday. The Target Zone 1.1732 - 1.1715 serves
as the target of the new trend.

It is profitable to sell the euro at strong resistances such as the
Additional Zone 1.1790 - 1.1786 and the Intermediary Zone 1.1839 -
1.1830. The downtrend border is in the Intermediary Zone.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

  1. Sell according to the pattern in Additional Zone 1.1790 - 1.1786. TakeProfit: 1.1743. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.
