USDJPY: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 18.09.2020 –
25.09.2020Alex Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 106.56 with a target of 104.00 – 103.00.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
106.56 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 108.14 –
109.85.

 **Analysis:** On the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame, apparently a descending
correction of larger degree finished forming as wave B, and wave С
started developing, with the first wave 1 of (1) of C formed inside. On
the H4 time frame, a descending correction continues forming as wave 2
of (1), with wave c of 2 developing inside. Apparently, the fifth wave
of smaller degree (v) of c is developing on the H1 time frame, with wave
iii of (v) developing inside. If the presumption is correct, the pair
will continue to drop to the levels of 104.00 – 103.00. The level of
106.56 is critical in this scenario as the breakout will enable the pair
to continue growing to the levels of 108.14 – 109.85.
