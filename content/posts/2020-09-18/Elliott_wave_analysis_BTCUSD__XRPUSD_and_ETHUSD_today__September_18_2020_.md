Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 18.09.2020Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I suggest entry signals
to trade each cryptocurrency intraday.

All cryptocurrency pairs are forming upward waves. The Bitcoin and the
Ripple are following bullish impulse waves. The Ethereum is developing a
zigzag-shaped motive wave [Z]. Therefore, one can consider long trades
for all cryptocurrency pairs today.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

 ****

The BTCUSD market is forming the down corrective wave. There is
currently unfolding the bearish double zigzag, where the down wave [W]
has completed. The market is rising in the linking wave [X] that is
unfolding as a standard zigzag. After the two sub-waves (A) and (B)
completed, the price has started rising in the (C) impulse. The (C)
impulse should have completed by 4/5, so, the price should continue
rising in the sub-waves (5) towards a level of 11480, where the linking
wave [X] will be 61.8% of wave [W].

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today

Buy 10905.50, TP 11480.00

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

 ****

The XRPUSD market is also forming the double down zigzag. The bullish
wave (W), composed of the two impulse wave A and C, and the corrective
wave B, has completed. The market is now following the linking wave [X],
which must complete as a simple zigzag A-B-C. Wave A is a leading
diagonal, wave B is a zigzag, the C wave is an impulse that is still
unfolding. The Ripple price should be rising in the C impulse towards a
level of 0.278, where the (X) wave will be 50% of the (W) zigzag.

### Trading plan for **[XRPUSD][2]** today

Buy 0.250, TP 0.278

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

 ****

After the upward wave (Y) completed, the price has started declining in
the new down zigzag. The impulse wave A, which is the beginning of the
zigzag, has completed. The market is now rising in the corrective wave
B. The B correction is a triple zigzag [W]-[X]-[Y]-[X]-[Z]. This pattern
will complete when the final motive wave [Z] ends. It should finish at
the level of around 418.00, where the entire B correction will be 61.8%
of the A impulse.

### Trading plan **[ETHUSD][3]** today

Buy 386.21, TP 418.00
