USDCAD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 18.09.2020 –
25.09.2020Alex Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions from corrections above the
level of  1.2993 with a target of 1.3388 – 1.3629.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
1.2993 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of 1.2900
– 1.2800.

 **Analysis:** An ascending corrective wave of larger degree (B) of 4
has finished developing on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame, and wave (C) of 4
started forming. Presumably, the first wave 1 of (С) has finished
developing, and an ascending correction started forming as wave 2 of (C)
on the H4 time frame. Apparently, the wave a of 2 of smaller degree is
developing on the H1 time frame, with wave (ii) of a nearing completion
inside. If the presumption is correct, the pair will logically continue
to rise to the  levels 1.3388 – 1.3629. The level of 1.2993 is critical
in this scenario as the breakout will enable the pair to continue rising
to the levels of 1.2900 – 1.2800.
