USDCHF: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 18.09.2020 –
25.09.2020Alex Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions from corrections above the
level of 0.8998 with a target of 0.9242 – 0.9302.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
0.8998 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of 0.8900
– 0.8800.

 **Analysis:** Presumably, the descending third wave of larger degree
(3) continues developing on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame, with wave 1 of (3)
forming inside. On the H4 time frame, wave v of 1 is forming, with wave
(iii) of v formed inside. Apparently, a local correction is forming on
the H1 time frame as wave (iv) of v of smaller degree. Inside it, wave с
of (iv) has presumably started developing. If the presumption is
correct, the pair will continue to rise to the levels of 0.9242 –
0.9302. The level of 0.8998 is critical in this scenario. Its breakout
will allow the pair to continue falling to the levels of 0.8900 –
0.8800.
