Central banks act like circus clowns. Review as of 18.09.2020Dmitri
Demidenko

Mid-September is flooded with central banks’ meetings. There was no room
for boredom, but the show directors’ initial plan failed

## There’s a big gap between expectations and reality

Investors dream of a wealthy life, but central banks can only offer them
a fun one. Neither Frankfurt, nor Washington, nor London is happy about
their currencies’ consolidation, but each of them has its own way to
deal with the problem. The ECB attempted to use verbal interventions.
The Fed mentioned a powerful strategy of average inflation targeting.
The Bank of England did the best by hinting at negative rates.  The
pound fell as if shot, and then quickly recovered. The BoE has its own
problem: the country thought it had been living with a fool all its
life, but the fool thought the same.

What is inevitable shouldn’t be feared. The ECB’s fear that the euro
will consolidate will become reality sooner or later. The Executive
Board can only try delaying [EURUSD][1]’s growth above 1.2, but it can’t
hamper it. September’s attempt to put up a barrier to stop the bulls
seemed to work at first, but what goes down must come up. The major
currency pair didn’t develop a correction. The ECB might have lacked
time. That’s what always happens. You lack either time or money.

Christine Lagarde and her colleagues’ plan to trap the buyers of euro
could be developed in advance. However, the markets were really
surprised at the dollar’s reaction to the Fed’s change from an active
position (dramatic federal funds rate cut and QE expansion) to a passive
one.  They expected much more from their old partner:

> \- Which is your favourite sex position?

>

> \- Spectator's.

The greenback consolidated on better forecasts for employment and GDP,
and on the fact that four out of seventeen FOMC members dreamt of
tightening monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) as early as in 2022, while the forward market
didn’t predict a rate hike before 2024. Investors expected that the Fed
would unanimously vote for keeping borrowing costs at the zero level for
at least five years. Five years of idleness and relax...

> \- How many of you work there?

>

> \- Seventeen, including the Fed president.

>

> \- And excluding him?

>

> \- No one.

Ultimately, the markets believed in J. Powell’s powerful strategy which
helps recover the economy. Because their relationships are serious. As
serious as mine and my girlfriend’s: we haven’t laughed for two years.

The Bank of England decided to outplay them all.  Andrew Bailey said
negative rates were the bank’s current weapon, and thus dropped
[GBPUSD][2] quotes below the bottom of figure 29. Not for a long time,
though. The President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen’s
statement that the EU-British deal was still possible helped the pound
recover fast, even if Boris Johnson had spit on his contractual
liabilities earlier. The EU may still have a glimmer of love for its ex-
partner. And that’s good, because some people aren’t as enthusiastic
about their past:

> \- Is it your ex?

>

> \- It is.

>

> \- And what’s in the other bag?
