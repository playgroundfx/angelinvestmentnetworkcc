GBPUSD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 18.09.2020 –
25.09.2020Alex Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions from corrections above the
level of 1.2757 with a target of 1.3196 – 1.3481.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
1.2757 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of 1.2489
– 1.2244.

 **Analysis:** Presumably, the first wave of larger degree (1) continues
developing on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame, with wave 3 of (3) formed inside. A
local correction is forming as the fourth wave 4 of (3) on the H4 time
frame. On the H1 time frame, presumably wave a of 4 of smaller degree
has formed and an ascending correction is forming as wave b of 4. If the
presumption is correct, the pair will continue to rise to the levels
1.3196 – 1.3481. The level of 1.2757 is critical in this scenario as the
breakout will enable the pair to continue declining to the levels of
1.2489 – 1.2244.
