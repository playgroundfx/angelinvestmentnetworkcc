Medium-term forecast for oil, gold, and EURUSD 18.09.2020Alex Rodionov

I welcome my colleagues! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest trading
signals for traders who trade in medium-term trends.

This week, gold was testing the key resistance level but hasn’t broken
it out. There is a pattern to sell gold.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for next week: USCrude analysis

In the previous analytics, I wrote that oil was testing the key support
of the medium-term uptrend [37.34 – 36.72], we should have entered
purchases in the support zone first of all.

This week, the oil price chart has drawn the buy pattern followed by a
strong upward momentum, which is still going on. The growth target is
the high of August. Another upward target is in Target Zone 6 [49.17 —
48.42].

We should be holding purchases according to the pattern. Oil is trading
in the zone of [41.67 – 40.92], which was a strong resistance earlier,
we can take a part of profits and move the rest of the position to the
breakeven.

I recommend entering new buy trades on the correction to the key support
of the short-term uptrend. I will give more details in my [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/)
analytics next week.

It is not relevant to sell oil now.

### [USCrude ][1]Trading tips for the upcoming week:

Hold up purchases entered according to the pattern in Target Zone [37.34
- 36.72]. TakeProfit: 43.50. StopLoss: at breakeven.

## Gold price forecast for next week: XAUUSD analysis

The trading signal to sell suggested in the previous weekly analytics
didn’t work out. The sell trades yielded a loss. Next, the gold price
was corrected up to the last resistance, the second line of the triangle
technical pattern. This week, buyers were trying to break the level out,
but they failed. At the end of the week, there formed a pin bar in the
H4 chart, which has been confirmed. Furthermore, there is a double top
pattern to sell in the H1 chart.

I recommend holding down the sell trades entered according to the Price
Action pattern or entering new ones at the current levels with a stop
loss above the high of this week. The sell targets will be at levels
1903.0 and 1862.3.

Alternative scenario. The gold price breaks out the resistance and
consolidates above higher than the current weekly high. If so, there
will be a buy setup with a target in the upper Target Zone 2 [2044.9 —
2036.2].

### [XAUUSD][2] Trading tips for the upcoming week:

Sell at the current prices. TakeProfit: 1903.0, 1862.3. StopLoss:
1976.0.

## Euro/dollar price forecast for next week: EURUSD analysis

EURUSD is trading in the middle-term uptrend. Buyers have been holding
the price above the trend key support [1.1811 - 1.1791]. However, there
hasn’t been a buy pattern. It will emerge if the price breaks out the
resistance at 1.1918 and consolidates above. For next week, I suggest
expecting a buy setup and entering purchases with the target at Target
Zone 5 [1.2096 - 1.2078].

Alternative scenario. The price breaks out the key support of the
uptrend and consolidates below at the US session. If so, the EURUSD
middle-term trend will turn down, and the sell target will be the lower
Target Zone 2 [1.1611 – 1.1591]. One could enter sell trades on the
retest of the broken-out TZ [1.1811 - 1.1791].

### [EURUSD][3] Trading tips for the upcoming week:

  1. Buy according to the pattern in Target Zone [1.1811 - 1.1791]. TakeProfit: Target Zone 5 [1.2096 - 1.2078]. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. If the price breaks out Target Zone [1.1811 — 1.1791], sell according to the pattern on the retest. TakeProfit: Target Zone 2 [1.1611 - 1.1591]. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

> IZ - Intermediary Zone: responsible for the price momentum reversing

>

> TZ - Target Zone: a zone that is 75% likely to be reached after IZ
breakout.

>

> GZ - Gold Zone: zone in the medium-term momentum.

>

> All zones are calculated based on the average [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) price of the
instrument and margin requirements of the futures.
