Dollar goes against the crowd. Forecast for 18.09.2020Dmitri Demidenko

[EURUSD][1] is going up despite the ECB verbal interventions and the Fed
tone, not dovish enough. I will cover the reasons for the euro rally. In
the end, I will offer the [EURUSD][1] trading plan.

## Fundamental US dollar forecast for today

The market often penalizes for being overconfident. I accurately
anticipated the Forex market reaction to the ECB meeting, suggesting one
could sell the [EURUSD][1] on the rise above [1.19][2]. I also predicted
the market trend after the Fed meeting, offering to enter shorts on the
price fall below the [bottom of figure 18][3]. However, in both cases,
the major currency pair didn’t continue falling. It could have looked
strange amid the dovish stance of the Governing Council members and the
drop of the US stock indices but for the understanding of the market
general sentiment. Investors believe in the long-term bullish outlook of
the euro and enter longs on the drawdowns.

If the market doesn’t go where it is expected to, it must be going in
the opposite direction. The [EURUSD][1] should have been deeply
corrected for several reasons. The ECB wants to weaken the euro, Jerome
Powell is not dovish enough, the Fed’s new [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the average
inflation targeting is not yet clear. Speculators, having accumulated
the maximum net shorts on the US dollar since 2011, should have started
exiting the trades at the first signs of trouble. However, the majority
of traders were buying out the euro on the price falls.

[EURUSD][1] bulls have many reasons to buy the euro. First, it is the
Chinese economic recovery. China, unlike most advanced economies,
featured the GDP growth in the second quarter, which is an important
driver for the export-led euro-area economy. Second, the world’s central
banks diversify their Forex reserves in favor of the euro. Third, the
euro-area economy is recovering faster than the US growth, which is
signaled by Bloomberg's leading indicators. And, finally, the Fed is
willing to weaken the dollar.

The Federal Reserve is willing to put up with the inflation above its 2%
target, but it can’t make prices grow. The optimal option is to improve
financial conditions. The US central bank seems to be successful.
However, the strong greenback hinders the Fed’s [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). Although Jerome
Powell says the Fed has more monetary tools, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s doubt it. The
Federal Reserve has already lowered the interest rate to zero, it is
buying $100 billion of assets per month. As for the increase in the
volume of lending, you can lead the horse to the water but you can’t
make it drink. The Treasury gave the Federal Reserve $ 75 billion in
loans to small and medium-sized businesses, of which only $ 2 billion
was used.

### [EURUSD][1] trading plan today

The central banks can influence the markets only by the words now.
Jerome Powell used the word “powerful” 10 times in the press conference
following the FOMC September meeting. “This very strong forward
guidance, very powerful forward guidance that we have announced today
will provide strong support for the economy,” Fed’s Chairman told
reporters. Investors believe these words. They do not want to go against
the Fed and continue buying the [EURUSD][1]. If the price breaks out the
resistance levels of 1.19 and 1.192, it will continue to rally up.
