Euro benefits from carry trades. Forecast as of 19.02.2021Dmitri
Demidenko

The events of the beginning of the year look like the taper tantrum of
2013, but the Fed hasn’t yet commented on the situation. The US central
bank is likely to let the US economy overheat, increasing the chance of
the [EURUSD][1] uptrend recovery. Let us discuss the Forex outlook and
make up a trading plan.

## Weekly euro fundamental forecast

The rising rates of the global debt market concern not [only me ][2]but
also institutional [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s and central banks. The minutes of the
January meetings of the Fed and the ECB show that the FOMC expresses
much more concern about financial instability than Jerome Powell, who
says the economic risks are moderate. The ECB board tried to calm the
markets by stating that the evolution of real, not nominal, rates
matters to monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). In January, the issue was discussed, most
likely initiated by Isabel Schnabel, who warned that higher yields could
hit the stock market.

According to MUFG Bank, the fact that Treasury rates are significantly
higher than a few days ago may force [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s to reconsider their risk
appetite. In the past few months, low bond yields encouraged [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s
to trade stocks. JP Morgan notes that if there is anything to worry
about, it is the high share of emerging markets’ assets in investment
portfolios.

The events of the beginning of 2020 look like the taper tantrum of 2013.
However, the Treasury yields were rising because of the Fed’s
announcement of future tapering of the QE. At present, the US yields are
growing amid the hopes for a rapid recovery of the global growth and
inflation rise. The surge in bond yields in the US and Europe presses
down carry trades by narrowing spreads. Traders are worried and exit
trades, which strengthens funding currencies, such as the euro and the
greenback, and results in the [EURUSD][1] consolidation.

### Dynamics of bond yield spread

Euro strengthens amid the Governing Council members' comments, expressed
in the minutes of the ECB January meeting. According to the ECB board
members, the measures taken in December need more time to take full
effect. Such speeches suggest that, even if European bond yields
continue rising, the ECB will hardly react by the QE expansion.

Concerns and fears are not the same as real events. Although [EURUSD][1]
tends to consolidate in the short-term, the euro medium-term outlook
remains bullish also because the Fed and the Treasury are likely to let
the US economy overheat. Janet Yellen's calls for Congress to provide
massive stimulus and her status as an absolute insider with the Fed
suggest that the Federal Reserve will maintain the ultra-easy monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) for a long time and act according to the principle of "spend now,
pay later," offering to fund the debt at the expense of the central
bank.

### Weekly [EURUSD][1] trading plan

This cooperation of the Fed and the Treasury already took place in the
1950s, when US GDP grew by 8% -10% three times in a decade. If [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/)
repeats itself, the US could be the only driver for the global economic
recovery. If so, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s will again be interested in risky assets, the
dollar will fall, and the [EURUSD][1] will reach 1.25. In the meanwhile,
the euro-dollar tends to consolidate in the range of 1.2-1.22. I
recommend traders to focus on intraday [trading strategies](https://www.fintechee.com/forex-trading-strategies/).
