USDJPY: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 19.02.2021 –
26.02.2021Alex Geuta

 **Main scenario:** long positions will be relevant above the level of
102.56 with a target of 109.83 – 111.70 once correction has formed.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
102.56 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of 101.00
– 90.50.

 **Analysis:** Daily TM: apparently, a descending correction of larger
degree finished forming as wave B, and wave С started developing, with
the first wave (1) of С forming inside.

On the H4 time frame, the third wave of smaller degree 3 of (1) started
developing, with wave i of 3 formed inside. Apparently, the local
correction started developing as wave ii of 3 on the H1 time frame. If
this assumption is correct, the pair will continue to rise to the levels
of 109.83 – 111.70 once the correction’s over. The level of 102.56 is
critical in this scenario, as the breakout will enable the pair to
continue declining to the levels of 101.00 – 90.50.
