Dollar looks for benefits. Forecast as of 13.11.2020Dmitri Demidenko

Investors wonder if it is relevant to sell the greenback as a safe haven
or to buy because the US economy performs better than the euro-area.
Therefore, the [EURUSD][1] tends to consolidate. Let us discuss this and
make up a trading plan.

##  ** **Weekly** **US dollar fundamental forecast****

The market is like an ocean; the calm follows the storm. But calm
sometimes is anxious; [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s can’t define the further trend
direction. Investors start exiting longs on the US stocks amid the
record number of hospitalizations in the USA. Besides, the number of new
COVID-19 cases is above 100,000 per day during nine consecutive days,
and some US governors impose new restrictions. Another strict lockdown
will hardly occur, but local isolation will result in job losses and an
economic downturn. The [EURUSD][1] bulls will lose the major benefit if
the [S&P 500][2] fails to continue the rally.

The euro is supported by easing the market uncertainty and the hope for
the global GDP recovery amid the vaccination. The US dollar could
benefit from the divergence in economic expansion and monetary policies.
According to 90% of 65 Wall Street Journal experts, the financial
markets' uncertainty will ease as the US voting results are announced,
and there is positive [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) about the vaccines. 80% of specialists expect
the market to stabilize soon. According to Christine Lagarde, the ECB
sees far less uncertainty than before amid Joe Biden's victory, progress
on Brexit, and successful vaccine tests. The more clarity there is in
the market, the less reason to buy safe-haven assets, including the US
dollar.

On the other hand, the greenback should benefit from US economic
performance. According to Wall Street Journal experts, the euro-area
economy is likely to face a double recession while the US economy will
show better results than earlier expected. The US GDP should contract by
2.7%, compared to the previously expected drop of 3.6%. The unemployment
rate will drop to 6.7%, not to 7.8%. The risk of another downturn within
twelve months has been significantly down.

The forecasts of experts look optimistic, but the pandemic does not end.
Jerome Powell warns that the next few months will be tough for the
United States and that it is too early to assess the impact of vaccine
[news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) on the economy's development. New restrictions can discourage those
who think the glass is half full.

If the greenback loses the advantage of growth divergence, it may
benefit from underestimating uncertainty. There are more than enough
reasons for uncertainty growth. It is not known whether Washington's
attitude towards Beijing will soften under Biden. It is unknown if
Democrats and Republicans will find common ground over the fiscal
stimulus. 58% of Wall Street Journal experts expect the stimulus of $1
trillion -$2 trillion, 29% expect less than $1 trillion, 13% predict a
stimulus package of $2.1 trillion -$3 trillion.

###  ** **Weekly** **[EURUSD][1] trading plan****

Therefore, some benefits of the US dollar have exhausted, some still
work. That is why the [EURUSD][1] trend is not clear. If the pair breaks
out the resistance at 1.1845, the bulls should go ahead. On the other
hand, if the price goes below the support at 1.176, the bears can take
control.
