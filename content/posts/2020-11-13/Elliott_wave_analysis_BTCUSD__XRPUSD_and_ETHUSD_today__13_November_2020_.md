Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 13.11.2020Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I suggest entry signals
to trade each cryptocurrency.

Major cryptocurrency pairs are rising in impulse waves. Under the
current conditions, one could enter long positions.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

 ****

The BTCUSD market is forming the upward linking wave [X] as a double
zigzag. Wave (Y) is a simple zigzag A-B-C. After the B correction
completed as a triangle, the price has started rising in the impulse
wave C. There is now forming the impulse wave [5] of C. Corrective wave
(4) has recently completed as a triangle, and the price is now rising in
wave (5). The market should be growing to a level of 16900.00.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 16442.75, TP 16900.00

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

 ****

The Ripple market is forming an upward zigzag. Wave A is a leading
diagonal, as wave [4] exceeded wave [1]. The down corrective wave B is a
triple zigzag composed of the sub-waves [w]-[x]-[y]-[x]-[z]. There is
now forming a bullish impulse wave C, namely its final fifths sub-wave.
The first four parts must have completed within impulse [5]. So, the
market should be rising in the final wave (5) to a level of 0.272.

### Trading plan for **[XRPUSD][2]** today:

Buy 0.256, TP 0.272

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

 ****

The chart displays the B correction completed as a bearish zigzag
[A]-[B]-[C]. Following the B wave, the market has started rising in the
impulse wave C. The first four sub-waves [1]-[2]-[3]-[4] have completed
within the C impulse. Wave [5] is still developing. When correction (4)
finished as a triangle, the price has started growing in the final wave
(5). The market should be rising to a level of 507.00. Under the current
conditions, one could enter purchases.

### Trading plan for  **[ETHUSD][3] **today:
