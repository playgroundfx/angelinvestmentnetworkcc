USDJPY: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 13.11.20 - 20.11.20Alex
Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions from corrections above the
level of 104.12 with a target of 106.39 – 107.36.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
104.12 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of 103.15
– 102.50.

 **Analysis:** Daily time frame: presumably, a correction of larger
degree is completed in the form of wave (B), and wave (С) has started to
form, with the third wave 3 of (C) developing inside. H4 time frame: the
first wave of smaller degree i of 3 formed and an ascending correction
is developing in the form of wave ii of 3. On the H1 time frame,
apparently, wave (a) of ii has formed and correction is developing as
wave (b) of ii. If the presumption is correct, after correction, the
pair will continue to rise to the levels of 106.39 – 107.36. The level
of 104.12 is critical in this scenario as the breakout will enable the
pair to continue declining to the levels of 103.15 – 102.50.
