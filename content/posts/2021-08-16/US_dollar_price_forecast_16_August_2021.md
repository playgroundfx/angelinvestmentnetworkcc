Dollar is frustrated. Forecast as of 16.08.2021Dmitri Demidenko

The hope that Jerome Powell will announce the QE tapering at the Jackson
Hole bankers' meeting is fading. Investors exit the [EURUSD][1] shorts.
Is the euro downtrend broken? Let us discuss the Forex outlook and make
up a trading plan?

## Weekly US dollar fundamental forecast

Most [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s wonder what is happening in the bond market. I, however,
am more concerned about what is happening in the US stock market. The
University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index has been down to the
lowest levels since 2011, the Treasury yields, and the US dollar
crashed. Nonetheless, the [S&P 500][2] continued rallying up. The stock
index is going up, although most bullish drivers have been already
priced. Do buyers expect a new fiscal stimulus of $4.1trillion - $4.5
trillion? Congress will hardly apply measures relevant during the
recession when the US economy is going to be overheated.

On the other hand, everything is clear with the debt and foreign
exchange markets. The US Treasury yield doesn’t rise for a few reasons.
First, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s realize that the huge volume of debt accumulated during
the pandemic requires low rates. High rates are destructive from the
point of view of their service. As a result, the majority of [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s
do not think the Fed will start monetary normalization soon. Second,
markets believe in the Fed’s mantra about the temporary nature of high
inflation. Finally, a decline in the Treasury’s funding needs suggests a
higher risk of the Treasuries supply crisis. Under such conditions, even
the tapering of the US QE does not guarantee lower prices for
Treasuries.

The pressure on the Treasury yields holds the US dollar back.
Furthermore, the dollar bulls are frustrated because the Jackson Hole
conference scheduled on August 26-28 will hardly provide any pleasant
[news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) for the markets. Jerome Powell won’t dare to announce the tapering
of the QE. The Fed is likely to start monetary normalization at the
meeting on September 21-22, provided the US jobs report on September 3
is strong. Investors are disappointed because of Jackson Hole; the
[EURUSD][1] volatility is down, and traders are exiting the euro shorts.

### Dynamics of [EURUSD][1] volatility

Will the dollar bulls face a disaster because of the [EURUSD][1] surge
to 1.18? The euro has performed the best growth since May amid the drop
in consumer sentiment and Treasury yields. However, the stop-losses
above 1.1775 have also been triggered. On the other hand, fundamental
factors have not changed. The US economy has been ahead of the Chinese
for the first time since the 1990s. It will continue outperforming,
according to Moody's, for five, according to Capital Economics and
Oxford Economics, for three consecutive quarters.

The euro-area economy will hardly perform better than the US. The US
exclusivity is a reason to buy the dollar. Yes, the Delta sets the US
GDP back, but the recovery should continue.

### Weekly [EURUSD][1] trading plan

The frustration because Jackson Hole, resulting in the lower volatility,
suggests the [EURUSD][1] short-term consolidation. The trading range
will be clear soon. In the meanwhile, I suggest a consolidation range of
1.174-1.186.
