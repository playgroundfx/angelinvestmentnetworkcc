Kiwi starts and wins. Forecast as of 16.08.2021Dmitri Demidenko

Accelerating vaccinations in New Zealand along with the RBNZ monetary
restriction make the New Zealand dollar a G10 favorite. However, its
main enemy is outside the country. Let us discuss the Forex outlook and
make up a trading plan for [NZDUSD][1], [AUDNZD][2] and [EURNZD][3].

## Monthly New Zealand dollar fundamental forecast

It finally happened! For the first time since the beginning of the
pandemic, a G10 central bank is not going to lower, but to raise the
main interest rate. 20 out of 24 Bloomberg experts expect that at the
meeting on August 18, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand will increase the
cash rate from 0.25% to 0.5%, one economist predicts an increase by 50
bps, and three do not see any changes. Despite the raging Delta variant
in Asia, the monetary restriction is a sign of optimism. If monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) leads to normalization, then life will soon return to normal.

In the second quarter, unemployment in New Zealand fell from 4.6% to 4%,
wage growth in the private sector rose to a 13-year high, inflation
exceeded the upper limit of the RBZN-targeted range of 1-3%, and housing
prices jumped by 31% YoY. After that, it became clear that the central
bank had no choice but to raise the main interest rate. In July, RBZN
unexpectedly for [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s withdrew the QE program, signaling that the
rate hike is close.

At the same time, despite expectations of the RBNZ monetary restriction,
[NZDUSD][1] bulls didn't succeed in the summer. Since mid-June, the pair
has been stuck in the trading range of 0.692-0.706. In my opinion,
China, slow vaccination and the return of [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) interest in the US
dollar should be blamed for this.

The COVID-19 outbreak in China, which accounts for a third of New
Zealand's exports, risks slowing the island nation's economy. Goldman
Sachs lowered its forecast for Chinese GDP growth in 2021 from 8.6% to
8.3%, Morgan Stanley from 8.7% to 8.2%, provided that Beijing can defeat
the pandemic within a month. The latest statistics are disappointing:
retail sales increased in July by 8.5% against the forecast of 10.9%,
industrial production by 6.4% with the forecast of 7.9%, investments in
fixed assets by 10.3%, although Bloomberg experts predicted the 11.3%
growth.

Despite the fact that the number of COVID cases in New Zealand is small
and the country has opened access to fully vaccinated foreign tourists,
the slow vaccination campaign and the sad example of Australia, whose
economy is slowing due to COVID-19, kept [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s from buying Kiwi.

### Dynamics of business sentiment and swap differential in Australia
and New Zealand

Prime Minister, Jacinda Ardern, intends to accelerate vaccinations by
increasing the period between vaccinations from 3 to 6 weeks, which,
together with the increase in the probability of a cash rate rising to
60% by the end of 2021, allows the NZD to feel confident against most
G10 currencies. [AUDNZD][2] hit its [late May][4] target of 1.049
earlier than three months later, while [EURNZD][3] sales on the breakout
of [1.702 support][5] were successful.

In my opinion, the main enemy of the NZD is outside New Zealand. The
[S&P 500][6] fall and/or the rise in Treasury yields will force
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s to get rid of the [NZDUSD][1]. Until this happens, it is
relevant to enter purchases on the breakout of the resistances at 0.705
and 0.706. In addition, keep selling [AUDNZD][2] with targets at 1.0385
and 1.327, and [EURNZD][3] with targets at 1.651-1.653.
