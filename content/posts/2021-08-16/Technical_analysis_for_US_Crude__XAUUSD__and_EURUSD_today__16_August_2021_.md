Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 16.08.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

At the end of last week, the euro reached the key resistance level of
1.1802 within the short-term downtrend.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

Oil price is correcting to a short-term uptrend and is approaching the
Intermediary Zone 66.69 - 66.42 which serves as a key support. At the
moment the price is testing level 67.14. This level together with the
zone forms a zone of ​​good buy prices, in which traders should find a
pattern and enter buy trades with a target at level 69.76 and Target
Zone 71.02-70.47.

An alternative scenario implies a trend reversal down. To do this, the
bears need to break out the Intermediary Zone and consolidate the price
below at the US trading session. In this case, consider sales with the
target at the lower Target Zone 63.96 - 63.42.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

Open buy positions according to the pattern in 67.14 - 66.42.
TakeProfit: 69.76. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

After reaching Target Zone 2 1780 - 1775, the gold price is correcting
and approaching the strong support 1771 - 1770. New purchases should be
considered from this support with a target at level 1781.5.

If the Additional Zone is broken out, the price will drop to the
Intermediary Zone 1760 - 1757. The Intermediary Zone serves as the trend
key support, in which it is also profitable to look for purchases.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

  1. Buy according to the pattern in Additional Zone 1771 - 1770. TakeProfit: 1781.5. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. Buy according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 1760 - 1757. TakeProfit: 1781.5. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

At the end of last week, the euro reached the key resistance level of
1.1802 within the short-term downtrend. It was not possible to break out
the beforementioned level on Friday. Perhaps buyers will be able to
consolidate the price above level 1.1802 today?

The trend will reverse if the price consolidates above the Intermediary
Zone 1.1802 - 1.1793. In this case, look for a way to enter a long trade
with a target in the upper Target Zone 1.1900 - 1.1880.

If the Intermediary Zone is held and a sell pattern is formed, sell the
euro with the target at level 1.1709.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

Sell according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 1.1802 - 1.1793.
TakeProfit: 1.1709. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.
