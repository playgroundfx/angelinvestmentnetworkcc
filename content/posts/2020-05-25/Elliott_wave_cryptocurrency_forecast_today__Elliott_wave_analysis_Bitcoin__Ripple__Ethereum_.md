Sideways corrective wave [4] is developing within the large upward
impulse currently ongoing. Correction [4] is developing as a double
three (W)-(X)-(Y). The sub-waves (W) and (X) have completed, the sub-
wave (Y), composed of three sub-waves A-B-C, is yet developing. The
price is now declining in the bear impulse C that may complete around
the previous low made by the down wave (W).

There is developing the down corrective wave (B) that is an element of
the large upward zigzag (A)-(B)-(C). Correction (B) is likely to be
developing as a double zigzag W-X-Y. After the bullish linking wave X
completed, the market turned down and started following the final zigzag
Y. There have complete two elements of this zigzag, sub-waves [A] and
[B], so far. The price should be declining in the [C] impulse below
level 0.176 in the next few days. This is the previous low.

There is developing upward zigzag A-B-C. Impulse A, composed of five
sub-waves [1]-[2]-[3]-[4]-[5] has completed. There is now developing the
bear correction B as a double zigzag [W]-[X]-[Y], where the first two
elements have completed. The price is now following the bear impulse
wave (C) within the final zigzag-shaped wave [Y]. The price could be
declining in the (C) wave to a level of 174.66 or lower. This is the
previous low, made by wave (W).
