Analysis for oil, gold, and EUR/USD for 25.05.2020Alex Rodiоnov

###  **USCrude – oil**

Oil middle-term uptrend continues. The target is Target Zone 4 [34.17 -
33.42]. If this zone is broken out upside, the next upside target will
be Target Zone 5 [41.67 — 40.92].

![LiteForex: Analysis for oil, gold, and EUR/USD for 25.05.2020][1]

The short-term trend is up. Last week, the price was corrected down to
the zone of good buy prices [30.72 – 28.02]. Buyers drew the price up
form the support zone last Friday, and the price continued growing. The
growth target is to break through the high of May 21 and reaching Target
Zone 4 [34.17 – 33.42].

Today, I suggest entering long trades on the correction, the stop loss
will be at the level below 30.00.

It will be relevant to sell oil if Intermediary Zone [28.47 — 28.02] is
broken out.

 **[USCrude][3]Trading ideas for today:  **

Enter buy trades at level 30.73. TakeProfit: Target Zone 4 [34.17 -
33.42]. StopLoss: 29.70.

###  **XAUUSD – gold**

According to the margin zones methodology, gold is trading in the
middle-term uptrend. The price will hardly test the key support [1673.6
– 1664.4] soon.

However, there could be a chance to sell gold in the correction unless
the resistance Target Zone 5 [1757.2 — 1751.2] is broken out.

The gold short-term trend is also up. Last week, traders were testing
Intermediary Zone [1719.3 – 1714.8]. The zone wasn’t broken out. Next,
the price reached the intraday resistance [1742.4 – 1740.1]. This zone
was held down by sellers.

Let us sum up. The short-term trend is up, but there is a chance to sell
in the correction with a target to break through the low of May 21.
Next, we shall see, if traders will manage to break out the trend key
support. If they do, the next downside target will be the lower Target
Zone [1673.6 — 1664.4].

 **[XAUUSD][6] Trading ideas for today:  **

Hold down/enter sell trades according to the pattern in Additional Zone
[1742.4 - 1740.1]. TakeProfit: Intermediary Zone [1719.3 - 1714.8].
StopLoss: above 1745.0.

###  **EURUSD – euro/dollar**

Last week, the price was rising from the support zone [1.0835 - 1.0783].
The price stopped growing in the resistance zone [1.1017 – 1.0985].
According to technical analysis, the market is trading flat.

![LiteForex: Analysis for oil, gold, and EUR/USD for 25.05.2020][7]

The EUR/USD short-term trend is now turning down, as the sellers are
breaking through the trend key support [1.0917 – 1.0908]. Today and
tomorrow, I suggest selling on the correction at the 50% Fibonacci
retracement level with the target at today’s low and in the lower Target
Zone [1.0826 — 1.0808].

![LiteForex: Analysis for oil, gold, and EUR/USD for 25.05.2020][8]

 **[EURUSD][9] Trading ideas for today: **

Enter sell trades at level 1.0941. TakeProfit: 1.0875, Target Zone
[1.0826 - 1.0808]. StopLoss: 1.0966.

> IZ - Intermediary Zone: responsible for the price momentum reversing

>

> TZ - Target Zone: a zone that is 75% likely to be reached after IZ
breakout.

>

> GZ - Gold Zone: zone in the medium-term momentum.

>

> All zones are calculated based on the average [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) price of the
instrument and margin requirements of the futures.
