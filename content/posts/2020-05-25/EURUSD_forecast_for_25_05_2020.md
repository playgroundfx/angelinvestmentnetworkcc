Dollar remembers the problemsDmitri Demidenko

## The pandemic has worsened the problems of the global economy and
weakened the global economic state

You can’t be sure about anything. The [EUR/USD][1] should have rallied
up as France and Germany agreed with the fiscal stimulus of €500 billion
and the ECB is willing to continue doing its best to support the euro-
area economy despite the ruling of Germany’s constitutional court.
Especially since the German Bundesbank published on its [website](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/website-for-forex-trading/) a
positive report on the impact of QE on lending, the manufacturing
sector, and inflation. However, the euro can’t be rising without the
support of the US stock indexes. The decline of the US stock market and
a higher demand for safe havens set the euro bears back.

Buy on the rumors, sell on the facts. Earlier, the S&P 500 was rising
steadily amid the expectations of the reopening of the US economy, the
hopes for the V-shaped recovery of the US economy, and some positive
[news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) about creating a coronavirus vaccine. It is clear now that the
V-shaped recovery is unlikely, and the creation of the vaccine may take
a long time. Only 10% of global [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s polled by BofA Merrill Lunch
expect a V-shaped recovery of the US economy. The rest of them believe
that the economic growth will be held back by the weakness of the US
labor market, a decline in the investments, and the growing public debt
amid the huge fiscal stimulus.

According to the OECD research, rich countries are willing to pay $17
trillion of the debt, a part of which resulted from a decline in tax
revenues due to the pandemic. As a result, the total debt of the
advanced economies will rise from 109% to 137% of GDP.

Without a COVID-19 vaccine, the global GDP won’t quickly rebound. On the
contrary, the pandemic worsens the problems weighing on the global
economy. Before the pandemic, the economic weakness was observed in
China and the euro-area, which were pressed down by the trade wars, and
in the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) that was ultra-easy even without an extra
stimulus. Nowadays, the problems are getting worse, the situation
deteriorates, which increases the demand for safe havens. Moreover, the
tension in the US-China trade relations is getting stronger. The trade
dispute is likely to be escalated amid numerous factors. The White House
bans the purchases of the Chinese securities by the US pension funds,
the US has tightened the sanctions against Huawei and suggests the
overseas companies, whose shares are traded on the US stock exchanges,
must undergo an audit. Furthermore, Beijing is to impose the Hong Kong
security law.

The euro is also weighed on by the expectations of the expansion of the
euro-area QE at the ECB meeting on June 4. According to the minutes of
the ECB April meeting, the central bank is willing to avoid its previous
mistakes associated with the loss of confidence in financial markets, it
is about to increase the asset purchase volume. The ECB has already
bought securities worth €180 billion. Under the current QE pace, the ECB
will have run out its resources by October. It has to take more
measures. As a result, the [EUR/USD][1] is now trading in the
consolidation range of 1.077-1.099, it may well continue falling to the
support at 1.084.
