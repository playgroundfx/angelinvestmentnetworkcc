Forex is exiting lockdownDmitri Demidenko

## Enter trades on G-10 currencies according to the speed of their
economic recovery

The major Forex driver most of the time is the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of
central banks that serves as a kind of indicator representing a state of
an economy. However, in 2018-2019, the major market driver was trade
wars, in 2020, it is the pandemic. Big traders have to correct their
investment strategies. They, first, bet on countries suffered the least
from the coronavirus. Next, they considered the ability of the economies
to recover faster than their rivals. How are things going in the G10
countries?

According to Bloomberg Economics, an increase in the lockdown stringency
by 10 points results in a 4% drop in economic activity. If the lockdown
is strict, it is more difficult to exit it as the fear of infection is
great. On the contrary, if the measures limiting the activity are less
serious, people are getting used to fear gradually. Therefore, the
countries that closed the smaller part of their economy can expect a
quicker GDP rebound than their rivals. Their currencies are likely to be
strengthening.

Based on the lockdown stringency, I can suggest that the US economy
should rebound sooner than the Spanish or French, but slower than the
German GDP. I could presume that Germany will pull the euro-area along,
like a locomotive. However, its power won’t be enough to outperform the
USA. After all, we don’t have to create EUR/USD [trading strategies](https://www.fintechee.com/forex-trading-strategies/) based
on the exit from the lockdown by different countries. There are other
trading instruments. For example, there are CAD and AUD.

Unlike the Fed and the ECB, the fiscal stimuli in Canada and Australia
look much smaller. The BoC launched the QE worth CA$300 billion ($216
billion). The RBA merely started the yield curve control [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) and
lending programs worth AU$90 billion (59 billion). Furthermore, Philip
Lowe says the interest rates are unlikely to go below zero, as the side
effects will be stronger than the benefits. Both the Bank of Canada and
the Reserve Bank of Australia follow the Fed’s path, which is now
sticking to a wait-and-see approach. The Fed is willing to first assess
the effect of the measures taken already, and only after that, it should
discuss a possible expansion of the monetary stimulus.

The ECB, on the contrary, signaled its willingness to boost the QE pace
in June. Besides, the lockdown in Europe is stricter than in Canada or
Australia. Therefore, it seems relevant to sell the [EUR/AUD][3] and the
[EUR/CAD][4] on the breakouts of the supports at 1.655 and 1.509. It
will be relevant to buy the [AUD/USD][5] and sell the [USD/CAD][6],
using the e[xcellent trading services and [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) offered by
LiteForex][7], with the middle-term targets at 0.69 and 1.37 if the US
stock indexes continue rallying up and there is not a new round of the
US-China trade war.
