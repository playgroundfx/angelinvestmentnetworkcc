What Are Derivatives? Essential Things You Need to KnowJana Kane

Obtaining financial literacy is a complicated process that entails a
confident understanding of major financial concepts such as implementing
money-saving strategies or creating investing roadmaps. It starts by
acquiring basic knowledge of money matters and proceeds with research on
more advanced financial tools. In this article, we will shed some light
on the financial phenomenon of derivatives. Take a seat and enjoy the
journey!

The article covers the following subjects:

## What Are Financial Derivatives and How Do They Work?

Derivatives are contracts binding two parties that enter into a
commitment to hand over a pre-agreed asset (or a pre-agreed derivative
value) at the predetermined time and at the preset price. There are
several types of underlying assets; they can be a financial asset, an
index (a set of assets), a security, or even an interest rate.

The purchaser agrees to buy the specific asset on the predetermined date
at the preset price. Notably, a derivative’s seller doesn’t have to be
the owner of an underlying asset, as they can deliver on the contract by
simply providing a purchaser with enough money to buy the agreed-upon
asset at the specific price.

Let's see how it works. Consider an American [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/), Jeff, whose
accounts are denominated in USD. Jeff buys shares of a European company
via any of the operating EU exchanges for euros. From then onward, Jeff
is vulnerable to the risk of a shift in the exchange rate. If the value
of the US dollar against the euro rises, Jeff won't profit from selling
his shares of the European company.

If a seller gives a purchaser another derivative, it will offset the
value of the first contract. That’s the main reason why derivative
contracts are much easier to manage and trade than any type of
underlying asset itself.

Derivatives can serve as effective financial instruments for the
purposes of risk mitigation (hedging) or be used to speculate on
possible risks for the sake of a commensurate reward.

Derivatives are usually traded on specialized exchanges, with some of
them being traded off-exchange or over-the-counter (OTC).

## Types and Classes of Derivatives

Derivative products can be separated into two classes: lock products
(e.g., swaps) and [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) products (e.g., stock [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/)).

  *  **Lock products** seal the deal between the corresponding parties from the outset to the negotiated [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) during the life of the contract.
  *  **Option products** provide the holder with the right (without any obligations) to trade the underlying asset at a specific contract price on or before the option expires.

As we have already mentioned above, a derivative’s value is based on an
asset; however, if you own a derivative, it doesn’t mean that you own
the asset itself. The most common types of derivatives are futures,
forwards, [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/), swaps, and warrants. Let’s learn a bit more about
them.

### Forwards vs. Futures

A forward, also known as a forward contract, is a customized private
contract between two respective parties that is concluded in order to
buy or sell an underlying asset at an agreed-upon price on a specific
date. Forwards are frequently used for either hedging or speculation,
though their non-uniform nature makes them a perfect tool tailored for
hedging.

Forwards and futures have a lot in common, yet they are not perfectly
alike. Both are based on the agreement to buy and sell some assets at
the preset date, while their prices are derived from corresponding
underlying assets.

A future, also known as a futures contract, is a likewise legal
arrangement to buy or sell some assets at a predetermined price at a
preset time in the future. However, a future is a standardized contract
between a party and an exchange market that is characterized by fixed
maturity dates and a day of expiration. Settlement for the futures
contract takes place on a [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) basis.

So, there is a significant difference between forwards and futures: a
forward contract can be customized to a commodity, amount, date, and
place of delivery; it always settles at the end of the expiration date
and is an OTC derivative.

### Warrants

A warrant is a financial derivative that is issued by the company
itself, providing its owner with the right (without any obligations) to
trade securities — usually equities — at an agreed-upon price before the
given expiration date. Warrants are rarely issued by a third party and
are often OTC-traded. The prevailing price of an underlying security is
called an exercise price or a strike price, and once a warrant is
exercised, an underlying stock must be delivered.

There is a substantial difference between American and European
warrants; the first ones can be completed at any moment on or before the
expiration date, while the second type of warrant can only be exercised
on the preset date of expiration.

  * Call warrants are financial derivatives that give you the right to buy securities.
  * Put warrants are financial derivatives that give you the right to sell securities.

### Options

An option shares some common traits with a warrant, as it also grants
the purchaser the right (without any obligations) to buy or sell the
underlying asset at a preset price. However, [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) don’t have to be
issued by a company; they are typically contracts that are traded
between two people without any business entity being involved. Another
distinctive feature of an option contract is that the contracting
parties are not required to honor the agreement to purchase or sell the
asset. An option can be defined as “an opportunity,” while a future is
always “an obligation.”

  * Call [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) are financial derivatives that give you the right to buy stocks.
  * Put [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) are financial derivatives that give you the right to sell stocks.

### Swaps

Swaps are the most widespread and tradable derivatives. A swap is a
temporary exchange of assets (currency, securities, stocks, etc.) in
trading on an exchange. The main feature of a swap is that the exchange
is transitory; the parties to the transaction will have to return their
assets to each other within the stated period of time. Swaps are used to
drive out potential risks and enable [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s to access the prevailing
markets that operate under different jurisdictions.

Most swaps are either based on currencies or variable interest rates.
Investors frequently use swaps as a hedging tool to alleviate potential
risks.

For instance, a person can sell stocks in one country and then buy them
in a foreign currency to hedge the existing currency risks. In this
case, stocks are traded off-exchange.

## Advantages of Derivatives Trading

Even if you have never worked with financial derivatives before, you can
find tons of information that proves their significant impact on the
modern finance market. Here are some essential benefits of derivatives
that should be taken into account by aspiring [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s:

### Risk Management

Hedging is one of the most popular risk management tools employed to
recoup losses by taking an opposite position in a related asset.

As the value of the derivative contract depends on the value of the
underlying asset, such derivatives as [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) or forwards are used for
hedging. The strategy of hedging provides an [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) with some kind of
insurance, as it alleviates the possible risks of unfavorable price
movements in the corresponding asset. It’s similar to when you buy
property damage insurance to hedge your house against robbery, fires, or
other incidents.

In derivatives, it’s also possible to transfer risks from one party to
another using swaps (as mentioned above).

### Actual Value Determination

Derivatives are often used as an effective financial instrument to
determine the actual value of the underlying asset. The spot prices of
such commodity derivatives as futures can provide good insight into the
current trade prices of the specific commodities and help determine the
prevailing market price of an asset.

### Increased Market Efficiency

Derivatives are generally considered powerful boosters of financial
markets efficiency. Derivative contracts enable [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s to easily
replicate the payoff of their assets and avoid [arbitrage](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/arbitrage-bot-bitcoin/) opportunities
due to the balance between the contract and the value of the underlying
asset.

### Access to Unavailable Markets

Using derivatives, organizations and companies can enter markets and
assess assets that were unavailable to them before. Investors can obtain
a more beneficial variable rate by commanding the advantages of interest
rate swaps instead of falling back on direct borrowing.

### Reduction in Transaction Costs

Since derivatives are widely regarded as effective risk management
tools, the cost of trading in contracts is considerably lower than in
other financial units.

### Access to Information

Derivatives are about a rich load of data that can be used to evaluate
the market sentiment properly. Even a person who doesn’t know much about
finances can still make use of information provided by the current
situation at the F&O (Futures and Options) market, thus getting insight
into either short or long-term market price fluctuations.

## Major Disadvantages of Derivatives

There are always two different sides to the same coin. Though the
benefits of derivatives may seem appealing, every financial instrument
has its peculiarities that can be put down as drawbacks. Unfortunately,
derivative contracts make no exception.

For starters, the downsides of credit derivatives are often held up as
one of the reasons the Global Financial Crisis of 2007-2008 occurred;
devalued mortgage-backed securities and credit-default swaps caused the
global financial collapse. What else should you know about the pain
points of derivatives?

### High Risks

It’s sad, but it’s true: derivatives are potentially exposed to huge
financial losses. The complicated nature of the contracts makes the
evaluation process extremely sophisticated, and in individual cases,
even impossible. Therefore, some derivatives bear a high inherent risk.
It’s almost impossible to estimate a derivative’s actual value, as it’s
usually based on the value of several underlying assets.

The main reason mortgage-backed securities turned out to be so deadly to
the world economy is that no one knew [how to](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-trading-how-to/) value them - neither the
programmers who created them nor experienced financial experts.

### Speculation Risks

Derivatives can indeed serve as speculation tools; however, due to their
unpredictable nature, they can be extremely risky and cause considerable
losses.

### Counterparty Risks

Due diligence processes are a must for exchange-traded derivative
contracts. Nevertheless, there are still some derivatives traded OTC
that don’t integrate benchmarks for due diligence; therefore, they are
exposed to counterparty default.

### Time Restrictions

Such a peculiarity of derivatives as time-binding can also lead to
potential losses. You can bet that petrol prices will increase soon, but
you are not able to predict the exact date when it will happen - thus,
you can’t profit from your assumptions, and you simply waste your time
and resources.

### Leverage

Leverage is a financial technique that involves the use of borrowed
funds. You have to be very careful when employing it. For instance,
futures owners maintain their ownership by putting from 2% to 10% of the
contract into a respective margin account. However, once the value of
the underlying asset takes a beating, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s will have to add the
required amount to the margin account to hold down the contracted
percentage until the derivative expires or is offset. If the value of
the asset keeps dropping, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s risk losing considerable amounts of
money.

## Where Are Derivatives Traded?

As we have already stated before, derivatives are usually traded either
on exchange (ETD) or off-exchange (OTC).

### Futures

The futures market operates in a physical location, meaning that it is
centralized, unlike, for example, [cryptocurrency exchange](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/best-cryptocurrency-exchange/)s. The Chicago
Board of Trade and the Mercantile Exchange are the most prominent
futures exchanges. Each futures contract is traded in a special enclosed
place known as a “pit” or a “trading floor.”

Most derivatives are traded on exchanges. For instance, commodity
futures are traded on a futures exchange, which is a special marketplace
created to buy or sell various commodities. Members of the exchange,
such as brokers and commercial traders, have to register with the NFA
(National Futures Association) and the CFTC (Commodity Futures Trading
Commission), which is a managing federal authority that regulates the
futures markets. The CFTC ensures that the financial markets under its
management function according to all applicable laws and [regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/)s; it
also has to prevent [fraud](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/cryptocurrency-fraud/) and other abusive trading activities.

### Options

Like other derivatives, [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) contracts are traded on exchanges that
serve as intermediaries between buyers and sellers. The CBOE (Chicago
Board Options Exchange) is the largest and one of the most reliable
[options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) marketplaces in the world. Options trading is regulated by the
SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission), the main function of which is
to monitor the existing markets and safeguard them against the violation
of rules or any kind of malfunction.

### OTC Transactions

  * Regulations of financial activities are determined either by a product or an exchange. For instance, currencies are usually traded OTC, meaning the trade is made between brokers and financial institutions (e.g., banks). Two legal entities can also agree to exchange currencies at a specific rate at a predetermined date. Financial authorities and individual brokers are both regulated by the SEC. Transactions conducted via OTC might be risky since they are not controlled by any central marketplace.

### CFD Trading

CFD trading is a financial derivative product that enables traders to
speculate on the rise and fall of a price of fast-moving global
financial markets, including currencies, stocks, indices, commodities,
etc.

You can try CFD trading with LiteForex. It offers trading of the most
popular trading instruments, such as [oil][1], stocks ([NYSE][2] and
[NASDAQ][3]), and [metals][4].

## Are Financial Derivatives Worth Your Attention?

Derivatives were once described as weapons of mass destruction, and
there is a good deal of truth in this utterance. A derivative contract
can be very beneficial and present your legitimate interest  if you know
[how to](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-trading-how-to/) employ them properly. Risk-averse [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s usually consider
these financial instruments inherently evil; there are, however,
multiple ways you can manage the unique potential of derivatives to
enhance the functionality of your investment strategy.
