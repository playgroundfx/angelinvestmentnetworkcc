Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 09.09.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

The bearish trends for all cryptocurrency pairs covered in the article
continue, the prices will be falling.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

The BTCUSD market completed the corrective up wave [B], turned down, and
started declining. There should be unfolding the inceptive part of the
bearish impulse. Sub-waves 1 and 2 seem to have completed, and the
market continues declining in sub-wave 3. The price should soon reach
the previous low of 41800.00, marked by sub-wave 1, and go down to lower
levels. One could enter sell trades.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Sell 46127.50, TP 41800.00

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

The XRPUSD market finished the long-term linking wave (X). Next, there
started a new bearish wave. There should be forming the initial part of
the downward impulse. Sub-waves 1 and 2 seem to have completed, an
impulse and a correction, completed as a double three [W]-[X]-[Y].
Therefore, the Ripple price should continue declining in impulse 3 to a
level below 0.950, marked by wave 1. One could enter sell trades.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] **** today:

Sell 1.094, TP 0.950

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

The ETHUSD market is forming the beginning of the new bearish wave,
which has started after the completion of corrective wave B. There
should be developing an impulse, whose first two sub-waves have
finished. Sub-wave 1 is impulse, correction 2 is composed of sub-waves
[W]-[X]-[Y]. The market should be declining in sub-wave 3 to a level
below 2895.00, marked by impulse 1. One could enter sell trades in the
current situation.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Sell 3474.58 TP 2895.00
