Euro shuffles cards. Forecast as of 09.09.2021Dmitri Demidenko

Dollar strengthening amid FOMC officials' hawkish stance confused the
[EURUSD][1] traders. It is not clear how the pair will react to the ECB
meeting’s outcomes. Let us discuss the Forex outlook and make up a
trading plan.

## Fundamental euro forecast today

A week earlier, the hawkish comments of the ECB officials for some time
obscured the US jobs report. Now, the tone of the FOMC members has made
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s forget that the meeting of the European Central Bank is the
highlight of this week. The confidence of the Fed’s officials in the
need to start monetary normalization has lured [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s back to the US
dollar and sent the [EURUSD][1] down to the bottom of figure 18. As I
had expected, the pair didn’t consolidate [above level 1.186][2],
proving the weakness of the euro bulls and the reason to sell.

According to the President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, John
Williams, the inflation target has been met, and the progress of the US
economy towards full employment is obvious. As for the August jobs
report, the data for some months come in stronger, some months are not
so strong. The cumulative level of employment progress is more important
than month-to-month changes.  Williams said that if the economy
continued to improve as he expected, it could be appropriate to start
tapering the QE already in 2021. The presidents of the Federal Reserve
Bank of St. Louis, James Bullard, and the Federal Reserve Bank of
Dallas, Robert Kaplan, share similar views. The latter is ready to start
tapering the quantitative easing program in October.

My experience with financial markets teaches that the main thing is not
the actual data on inflation, unemployment, or GDP, but what the
representatives of central banks think about their future trends. In
this regard, the strengthening of the US dollar in response to the
hawkish comments of the FOMC officials looks natural, just like the euro
strengthening a week earlier. The question is, how will [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s react
to the upcoming ECB meeting’s outcome.

The [EURUSD][1] drop ahead of the important event has shuffled the
cards. The pair usually rises on the expectations of hawkish surprises
from the European Central Bank or starts consolidation because of the
doubts that they will come. This time, the euro is going down. It is
unusual as there are several bullish drivers. Some analysts suggest the
ECB has upgraded the forecasts for the euro-area GDP and inflation, and
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s expect a reduction in the monthly pace of asset purchases
under the PEPP from the current €80 trillion to €60 trillion for the
rest of the year. Furthermore, Christine Lagarde will make every effort
to explain that this is just an adjustment of the programme, rather than
a complete withdrawal of the monetary stimulus.

### Dynamics of PEPP

According to former ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet, Europe and the
USA  are in different universes. The Fed has a commitment to purchase
exactly the same amount every month, $120 billion, and tapering means
the withdrawal of the QE. The ECB’s QE is flexible, its volume is € 1.85
trillion, and no one is going to phase it out.

### [EURUSD][1] trading plan today

Of course, the high vaccination rate in the EU, strong GDP data in the
second quarter, PMI increase in the third quarter, and inflation surge
to a ten-year high give the ECB reasons to discuss monetary
normalization. But the central bank should be extremely careful. I
believe if Christine Lagarde does not report a boost in the APP volume
in exchange for a reduction in asset purchases under the PEPP,
[EURUSD][1] may rise to 1.1845 and higher. Otherwise, dovish comments
could result in the pair drop below 1.18.
