Elections put pressure on loonie. Forecast as of 09.09.2021Dmitri
Demidenko

The sharp [USDCAD][1] rise against the background of the stabilization
of the oil market looks like an anomaly. Nevertheless, the upcoming
parliamentary elections in Canada serve as a decent explanation.
Uncertainty puts pressure on the loonie, slowing down its growth. Let us
discuss the Forex outlook and make up a trading plan.

## Weekly Canadian dollar fundamental forecast

Monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) can be compared to racing. If someone's car stands
still, which implies the reluctance of the central bank to taper QE, it
can easily be bypassed by others. Overtaking happens if someone starts
off quickly with a subsequent loss of speed, and his competitor, on the
contrary, increases it. This is what is currently happening with the
Canadian dollar. The CAD has allowed the British pound and greenback to
surpass itself in the G10 top performance list. Given the neutral
dynamics of oil, it is obvious that monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) should be blamed for
the [USDCAD][1] sharp rise.

The Bank of Canada has long been considered the most aggressive
regulator in favor of normalization amid soaring inflation, labor
market, and GDP recovery. The BoC began to taper QE at the end of 2020,
allowing the loonie to lead the G10 currencies. However, the
strengthening of the national currency and supply disruptions badly
affected Canada's exports, which pulled the entire economy down. The
decline in GDP by 1.1% in the second quarter was a real shock for
everyone, not just for Bloomberg experts, who expect the indicator to
grow by 2.5%.

### Inflation dynamics in Canada

At its September meeting, the Bank of Canada kept the overnight rate at
0.25%. The BoC officials noted that it will not go up until QE is over.
The Bank of Canada will continue to buy bonds at CA$2 billion a week,
but the pace will slow as the economy recovers. High inflation is
temporary, although prices will remain at high levels in the medium
term. This is a worldwide trend. As for the economic downturn in the
second quarter, the BoC expects it to accelerate in the second half of
the year.

### Overnight rate dynamics

Currently, money markets expect one overnight rate hike in 2022 and two
more in 2023. In October, the Bank of Canada will likely announce a QE
taper from $CA2 billion to $CA1 billion and will begin to implement it
no later than the beginning of next year. At the same time, Bloomberg
believes that an increase in the overnight rate should not be expected
earlier than the first quarter of 2023, as BoC decides to wait for the
full recovery of the labor market. In this context, the release of
Canadian employment data for August, scheduled for September 10, could
seriously affect the balance of power in the [USDCAD][1] pair.

In my opinion, the markets decided that Tiff Macklem's reluctance to
raise the topic of the GDP decline in the second quarter was of a
political connotation. If he did this, there would be grounds for mutual
accusations between liberals and opposition conservatives fighting for
power.

### Weekly [USDCAD][1] trading plan

The factor of the upcoming elections will undoubtedly put pressure on
the loonie, creating divergence in the dynamics of [USDCAD][1] and oil.
Nevertheless, the acceleration of the Canadian economy against the
background of the slowdown in the US and the implementation of the long-
term trading idea to normalize monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) ****will allow selling
the pair over time. Strong statistics on the Canadian labor market and a
breakout of support at 1.267 can serve as the reasons for entering short
trades.
