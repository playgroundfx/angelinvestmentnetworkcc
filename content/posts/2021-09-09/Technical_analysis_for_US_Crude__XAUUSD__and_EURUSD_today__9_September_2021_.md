Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 09.09.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

The euro is testing the key support of the short-term uptrend 1.1820 -
1.1812.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

Oil is growing within a short-term uptrend and is approaching the Gold
Zone 69.93 - 69.67. A breakout of the Gold Zone will mean further price
growth towards the Target Zone 2 72.85 - 72.32.

The task of traders following the trend is to look for oil purchases
with the first target around level 70.33.

The alternative scenario suggests a breakout of the support level of
67.17. In this case, the short-term trend will reverse down, and the
target for sales will be the lower Target Zone 65.32 - 64.81.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

Open buy positions according to the pattern in 67.87 - 67.17.
TakeProfit: 70.33. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

Gold bears are trying to break out the Target Zone 1792-1788. If
successful, the next target for sales will be the Gold Zone 1772-1770.

It is reasonable to consider new sales at strong resistance levels such
as Additional Zone 1793 - 1792 and Intermediary Zone 1805 - 1803. The
latter serves as the key resistance of the trend.

If the Additional Zone is broken out upside, it will be possible to buy
gold within correction with a target in the Intermediary Zone.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

  1. Sell according to the pattern in Additional Zone 1803 - 1802. TakeProfit: 1792. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. Buy when the Additional Zone is broken out upside. TakeProfit: Intermediary Zone 1805 - 1803. StopLoss: beyond the nearest local low.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

The euro is testing the key support of the short-term uptrend 1.1820 -
1.1812. So, look for buy patterns in the beforementioned zone. September
3 high + Gold zone 1.1936 - 1.1928 serve as the buy target. There is no
pattern at the moment, so keep watching the market.

The alternative scenario suggests a breakout of the Intermediary Zone
and closing of the price below at the US trading session. In this case,
the trend will reverse down, so start selling the euro with the target
at the lower Target Zone 1.1733 - 1.1725.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

Buy according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 1.1820 - 1.1812.
TakeProfit: 1.1908. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.
