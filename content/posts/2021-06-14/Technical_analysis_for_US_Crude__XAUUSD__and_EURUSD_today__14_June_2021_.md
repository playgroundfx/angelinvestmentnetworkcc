Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 14.06.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

Last week, euro traders worked out a priority downward pattern.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

The oil price continues to rise within the short-term uptrend. The
growth target is Target Zone 2 72.64 - 72.11. Last week, the traders
managed to consolidate the price above the level of 70.42. Today,
another high was updated.

It is possible to calculate strong support zones based on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/)
high, so it will be profitable to look for new purchases on corrections
at the aforementioned strong supports. Thus, the Micro-zone is located
at the levels of 70.36 - 70.29. The Additional Zone is located at the
levels of 60.70 - 69.56 and serves as the trend's border.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

  1. Buy according to the pattern in Micro-zone 70.36 - 70.29. TakeProfit: 70.95. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. Buy according to the pattern in Additional Zone 60.70 - 69.56. TakeProfit: 70.95. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

Today, the short-term gold trend reversed down by breaking out the
Intermediary Zone 1879 - 1877. Now the price is approaching the Target
Zone 1858 - 1853. After the test of the Target Zone, the priority sell
pattern will be worked out. The further price drop will depend on the
sellers' ability to break out the support and consolidate the price
below.

It is profitable to look for new sales on correction in the Additional
Zone 1872 - 1871 and the Intermediary Zone 1884 - 1882. The target will
be the local high of the day.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

  1. Sell according to the pattern in Additional Zone 1872 - 1871. TakeProfit: Target Zone 1858 - 1853. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. Sell according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 1884 - 1882. TakeProfit: Target Zone 1858 - 1853. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

Last week, euro traders worked out a priority downward pattern. As a
result, the Target Zone 1.2090 - 1.2072 was reached.

On Monday morning, the short-term downtrend continues. The further
decline will depend on the sellers' ability to consolidate the price
below the Target Zone 1.2090 - 1.2072. If successful, the sales target
will be the Gold Zone 1.2002 - 1.1993.

It is profitable to look for new sales on corrections at strong
resistance levels, for example, the Additional Zone 1.2141 - 1.2136.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

Sell according to the pattern in Additional Zone 1.2141 - 1.2136.
TakeProfit: Target Zone 1.2090 - 1.2072. StopLoss: according to the
pattern rules.
