Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 14.06.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

All three cryptocurrency pairs covered in the article must be forming
bullish impulses.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

After the impulse down wave [1] had competed, the market began forming
the corrective wave [2] as a simple zigzag (A)-(B)-(C). Wave (A) is an
impulse. The corrective wave (B) is a double zigzag W-X-Y, which seems
to have completed. The Bitcoin price is now rising in the impulse upwave
(C). The market should continue rising in the sub-waves 3-4-5 to a level
of 44500.00, as outlined in the chart. At level 44500.00, wave [2] will
be 50% of wave [1] according to Fibonacci retracements.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 39361.40, TP 44500.00

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

The XRPUSD market must be forming the descending double zigzag
(W)-(X)-(Y). There is now unfolding the linking wave (X) which is about
to finish as a standard zigzag A-B-C. Impulse A and correction B have
already completed, the final impulse wave C is currently unfolding. The
sub-waves [3]-[4]-[5] should be developing in the near future, as it is
outlined in the chart. The price could go up to a level of 1.153, where
wave (X) will be 38.2% of wave (W).

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] today:

Buy 0.872, TP 1.153

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

The ETHUSD market is forming corrective wave 2 as a simple zigzag
[A]-[B]-[C]. The market seems to have completed the horizontal
corrective wave [B] as a double three (W)-(X)-(Y). Therefore, there
should be unfolding the bullish impulse wave [C] composed of the sub-
waves (1)-(2)-(3)-(4)-(5), driving the price to a level of 2930.00.
Level 2930.00 is the previous high where wave [A] completed. One could
enter purchases in the current situation.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Buy 2482.13, TP 2930.00
