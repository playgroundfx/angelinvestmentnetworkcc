Yen: It smells like a trouble. Forecast for 22.09.2020Dmitri Demidenko

The Japanese yen is one of the best-performing currencies in September.
I will cover the reasons for the yen rally. I also offer the EURJPY
trading plan for the week at the end of the article.

## Fundamental yen price forecast for the week

When I recommended buying[ the Japanese yen][1] a week ago, I considered
four growth drivers. They are the stabilization of the political
environment in Japan after the new Prime Minister took an office, the
divergence in the monetary policies held by the BoJ and other world’s
leading central banks, the talks about the escalation of trade wars,
and, finally, the uncertainty associated with trade wars. Since then,
the [EURJPY][2] rates have dropped by more than two figures. In addition
to the previous yen’s benefits, there are new ones. So, the euro is
likely to continue falling versus the yen.

The new head of government, Yoshihide Suga, does not see the need for
any immediate changes in the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the Bank of Japan, which
kept financial markets stable and loans to companies affected by
COVID-19. The prime minister's speech gave rise to rumors that if he
intervened in the central bak’s [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), it would be in order to support
the labor market, contribute to the economic recovery or limit the yen
strengthening, rather than to accelerate the growth of consumer prices.
According to Oxford Economics, Suga doesn’t pay much attention to the
inflation rate. While the GDP growth is going back to the trend and the
markets remain stable, the BoJ doesn’t depend on the inflation.

If so, the CPI drop below zero shouldn’t scare [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s with the
potential boost of the stimulus. Besides, the divergence in the monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) will continue to support the [USDJPY][3] and the [EURJPY][2]
bears. If we take into account the stability of the Japanese government
bond yields and the sharp drop of their European and American peers, the
yen looks undervalued compared to the euro and the US dollar.

The second pandemic wave in Europe, the correction of the US stock
indexes, and the associated growth of the demand for safe-haven assets
are other important factors pressing down the [EURJPY][2]. Theos pair is
more responsive to the [S&P 500][4] drop than the [USDJPY][3]. It
happens because [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are concerned that not only the euro-area but
also the global economy will follow the W-shaped recovery. In this case,
the US dollar will be quite demanded, as it was in early spring.

The US stock market has been boosting like a bubble amid the
expectations for a quick rebound of the US economy. It is time for
correction now. Investors believe that it will be more difficult to spur
the full economic recovery than it used to be. Besides, the situation is
worsened by the political uncertainty associated with the US
presidential election and a worse epidemiological situation in the euro-
area.

### Weekly trading plan for [EURJPY][2]

So, the divergence in the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), the second pandemic wave in
the euro-area, the concerns about W-shaped recovery of the European and
global GDPs, and the associated increase in the safe-haven demand
suggest holding the [EURJPY][2] shorts entered [at level 124.6][1] and
adding to them on the price growth. The middle-term targets are 121.7
and 120.7.
