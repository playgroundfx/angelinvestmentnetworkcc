Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 22.09.2020Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I suggest entry signals
to trade each cryptocurrency intraday.

Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ripple started forming downtrends. Therefore, it
is relevant to enter short trades for each of the three
cryptocurrencies.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

 ****

In the two-hour BTCUSD price chart, the market is forming the down
corrective wave B as a double zigzag [W]-[X]-[Y]. The upward linking
wave [X] is likely to have completed. The market is now declining and
forming the final wave [Y]. Wave [Y] is likely to complete as a simple
zigzag as well as the sub-waves [W] and [X]. The price should be
declining in the impulse wave (A) towards the level of 9500. Next, after
a short correction in the (B) wave, the price will continue declining in
the (C) impulse to a level of 8000, as it is outlined in the chart.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Sell 10464.25, TP 9500.00

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

 ****

The upward linking wave (X) is likely to have completed as a triple
zigzag W-X-Y-XX-Z. Next, the price has turned down and started
declining. The Ripple market must be forming a new down zigzag, namely,
its first leg, the A impulse. The impulse wave A should conclude at a
level of around 0.209. Next, the markets should start rising in the
corrective wave B, as it is outlined in the chart.

### Trading plan for **[XRPUSD][2]** today

Sell 0.230, TP 0.209

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

 ****

The ETHUSD market is forming the down zigzag A-B-C. The A impulse and
the bullish correction B have completed. The B correction is a triple
zigzag. The market is now at the beginning of the bear impulse wave.
After two small sub-waves [1] and [2] have completed, the downtrend
continued. The Ethereum price should soon go down below the level of
307.00, which is the previous low made by the A wave.

### Trading plan **[ETHUSD][3]** today

Sell 342.95, TP 307.00
