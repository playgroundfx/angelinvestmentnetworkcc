Dollar should float free. Forecast for 22.09.2020Dmitri Demidenko

Donald Trump tried to weaken the greenback, but everything turned
different. I analyze the [EURUSD][1] market situation and offer a
trading plan.

## Fundamental US dollar forecast for today

When the White House is losing a currency war without even taking part
in it. The second pandemic wave in Europe weakens the euro. The USA
stock indices are down, increasing the demand for safe havens. The Fed
members fail to reach an agreement on further monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). So, the
[EURUSD][1] bulls are set back. The major currency pair has had the
worst [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) drop for the month, having approaches the bottom of the
middle-term consolidation range 1.17-1.2.

Donald Trump asked officials to adjust the exchange rate of the dollar
to counteract what he described as repeated currency manipulation by
China of its yuan. He was rebuffed. “Sir, we can’t do that. It has to
float naturally.” It is a surprise, isn’t it? Such a speech would make
sense if the [USDCNH][2] was growing, but it is falling. Furthermore, an
unwise verbal intervention should strengthen the greenback, which has
ultimately happened. The US president must have wanted to draw
attention. Amid the dovish tone of the ECB, such a speech naturally sent
the [EURUSD][1] down. Christine Lagarde strongly rejects that the
European Central Bank has exhausted its monetary tools. At the same
time, the regulator is closely monitoring the strengthening of the euro
and its impact on inflation.

Lagarde believes that the economic recovery in the eurozone is
incomplete and uneven. She seems to be right, especially since the
second pandemic wave could set the rebound back. The second lockdown
would an economic suicide. However, the UK is considering a lockdown
amid the potential growth of new COVID-19 cases to 50,000 per day by
mid-October. According to the Telegraph, Boris Johnson is to urge
companies to work remotely. Travel restrictions are imposed in Madrid
and the surrounding area. In this region, the number of confirmed
coronavirus cases reaches 690 per 100,000 people. For comparison, in the
UK, there are 71 new cases, in Germany - 26.

The talks about a new lockdown in the UK triggered selloffs in the
global stock markets. 10 out of 11 [S&P 500][3] sectors closed down amid
the concerns that the global GDP rebound would be W-shaped. The CBOE
volatility index has soared to the highest level over the past few
weeks. The VIX must continue rising not only because of the uncertainty
around the US presidential election but also because of the disputes
among the Fed’s members. Jerome Powell persistently urges Congress to
expand the fiscal stimulus package. The St. Louis Federal Reserve
President James Bullard, however, believes that the economy can do
without additional assistance.

### [EURUSD][1] trading plan today

According to the Exchange Bank of Canada, unless the Fed chairman,
during his two-day speech, to US lawmakers, or other FOMC officials,
give more clues on the new average inflation targeting [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), the US
dollar should further strengthen. I think it shouldn’t occur until the
[EURUSD][1] breaks out the support at 1.17-1.171
