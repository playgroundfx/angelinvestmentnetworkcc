Short-term forecast for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 20.10.2020Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for day traders.

Gold is trading below the resistance area [1951.0 - 1882.5].

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

Medium-term oil trend is upward. The bulls are testing a strong
resistance Target Zone 5 [41.67 - 40.92]. If it is broken, the next
target along the trend will be Target Zone 6 [49.17 - 48.42].

If the resistance is not broken, there will be a correction to the key
support area [37.34 - 36.72].

The local trend is upward. The target for buying is the Target Zone
[42.56 - 42.01]. I recommend looking for longs on corrections or holding
existing ones up to the target.

See if the traders will be able to break through the Target Zone once
they reach it. If the American trading session closes higher, then the
next target will be Gold Zone [45.03 - 44.76].

Selling oil on such an uptrend is not advised. For short positions, you
need to wait for a breakout of the key trend support.

### [USCrude ][1]trading ideas for today:

Buy on correction from the trend line. TakeProfit: Target Zone [42.56 -
42.01]. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

Gold is trading below the resistance area [1951.0 - 1882.5]. I recommend
looking for a pattern for shorts within the medium-term downtrend. The
target for shorts will be Target Zone 2 [1829.4 - 1820.1].

Let's go to a chart of a smaller timeframe and analyze the local
impulse. We see on the chart that the trend is upward. The target is
Target Zone [1951.0 - 1941.7].

Yesterday the bulls tried to break through the resistance - Additional
Zone [1911.3 - 1908.7]. They couldn't do it, the price returned below
the level. However, there are no signals for shorts either. Now traders
are testing local support [1898.7 - 1897.0].

Today I see two scenarios:

  1. If you see a breakout of AZ, buy gold at a retest
  2. Sell gold according to the false breakout pattern.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

  1. Buying at a retest of Additional Zone [1911.3 - 1908.7] after breakout and consolidation. TakeProfit: Target Zone [1951.0 - 1941.7]. StopLoss: below the next local low.

  2. Sell according to the pattern from Additional Zone [1911.3 - 1908.7]. TakeProfit: Intermediary Zone [1880.7 - 1875.4]. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

The euro is still in a downtrend. A false breakout pattern was formed
last week. This week consider shorting according to the pattern with the
target at Target Zone 2 [1.1611 - 1.1591].

Buy the euro if the pattern fails to work and the Target Zone [1.1832 -
1.1812] is broken through.

The short-term trend in the EURUSD pair is downward. The target for
shorts is Target Zone [1.1631 - 1.1611]. Yesterday the price went into
correction and broke through Additional Zone [1.1752 - 1.1746].

Today it is possible to work out the upward correction up to the
Intermediary Zone [1.1816 - 1.1804]. To do this, consider buying the
euro from the area [1.1752 - 1.1730].

Look for shorts after the IZ is tested.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

Buy from the area of [1.1752 - 1.1730]. TakeProfit: Intermediary Zone
[1.1816 - 1.1804]. StopLoss: 1.1719.
