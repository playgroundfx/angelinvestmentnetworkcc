Central Bank isn’t an obstacle to yuan. Forecast for USDCNH for
20.10.2020Dmitri Demidenko

The PBoC’s first attempt to stop the yuan wasn’t successful, but the
market expects it won’t be the last one. Will the bank be able to put a
spoke into [USDCNH][1] bears’ plans? Let’s find it out and make a
trading plan.

## Monthly fundamental forecast for yuan

Almost thirty years have passed since George Soros bet the Bank of
England wouldn’t save the pound and thus earned $1 billion. Still, that
story continues to excite [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s. It is rumoured from time to time at
Forex that the SNB won’t be able to counteract the franc’s
consolidation. In 2020, the same rumor concerns the Chinese yuan.
Whatever the People’s Bank may do to stop [USDCNH][1] bears, it can’t
reverse the downtrend. That was proved in October, when the limits of
the banks’ purchasing foreign currency for clients through currency
forwards were cancelled. The yuan made a step backwards, but recovered
soon and continued reaching new heights.

Unable to grow by 5.3% as expected by Bloomberg in Q3, the Chinese GDP
was supposed to pour cold water on the yuan’s supporters. Dream on.
[USDCNH][1]’s correction was bought out fast, and the pair dropped to
its lowest since July 2018. The [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s noticed this year’s fastest
growth of industrial production (+6.9%) and retail sales (+3.3%) in
October and assumed the Chinese economy will feel even better in Q4. The
competitors can’t boast the same, though.

### Chinese GDP: structure and dynamics

 _Source: Nordea Markets._

According to the IMF’s forecasts, the Chinese GDP will grow 1.9% in
2020, while its American peer will drop 4.3%. However, the divergence
may be even bigger. I doubt that fiscal stimulus will be expanded before
the presidential elections. At the same time, the previous package’s
exhaustion will be a hindrance to recovery. Add a complicated
epidemiological situation in the USA, where 57,000 new cases are
registered [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/), and a hope for GDP’s active growth in October-December
may fade out.

The Fed isn’t going to give up its ultra soft monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). On the
contrary, it is ready to provide an extra stimulus if necessary,
according to Richard Clarida. The People’s bank of China doesn’t have to
do that: even if inflation slowed down to 1.7% in September, the main
reason was cheaper alimentary products, which had grown more expensive
during the pandemic. Thus, the yuan’s consolidation can be seen as a
temporary notion. The PBoC may not like that, as the consolidation slows
down CPI and exports, but the bank understands well that process is
objective: the divergence between economic growth and monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
expanded the US and Chinese bond yield spreads. That brings in money to
China’s financial markets.

### Monthly trading plan for [**USDCNH**][1]

Whatever the People’s Bank may do, from tougher yuan fixing to softer
capital control, it can’t prevent [USDCNH][1] from going down. Continue
exploiting retracements for selling at 6.65 and 6.5. How fast those
targets will be realized depends on who wins the US presidential
election.
