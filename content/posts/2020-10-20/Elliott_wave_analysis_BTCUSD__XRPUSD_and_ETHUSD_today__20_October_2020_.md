Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 20.10.2020Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I suggest entry signals
to trade each cryptocurrency.

At the moment, all the major cryptocurrency pairs continue developing in
the final fifth wave. Thus, I recommend looking for longs.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

 ****

As part of the upward double zigzag, which is currently developing, we
saw the completion of sub-waves (W) and (X) and now the final wave (Y)
is forming. Wave (Y) consists of three major sub-waves A-B-C, where
impulse wave A and corrective wave B have been fully completed, and
impulse wave C is still developing. Since the first four parts of
impulse C seem to be complete, in the near future wave [5] could rise to
the level of 12062.00.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 11740.75, TP 12062.00

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

 ****

On the H2 timeframe, we see a downtrend developing. Ripple is forming a
bearish zigzag A-B-C. Now the bullish correction B is in the development
stage. It takes the form of a regular zigzag [a]-[b]-[c]. In the last
section of the chart, we see the structure of the final impulse wave [c]
which consists of five sub-waves (1)-(2)-(3)-(4)-(5). After the downward
corrective wave (4), a double zigzag, had been completed, we saw wave
(5) rising. Its completion is expected at the level of 0.260.

### Trading plan for **[XRPUSD][2]** today:

Buy 0.247, TP 0.260

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

On ETHUSD, an upward corrective wave B is developing, it takes the form
of a double zigzag consisting of sub-waves [W]-[X]-[Y]. After the
completion of the first two parts, a smooth rise in wave [Y] began. Wave
[Y] takes the form of a simple zigzag (A)-(B)-(C). In the short term,
the market is expected to rise in the final impulse wave 5 of (C) to the
level of 394.20, that is, to the previous high.

### Trading plan  **[ETHUSD][3] **today:

Buy 377.79, TP 394.20
