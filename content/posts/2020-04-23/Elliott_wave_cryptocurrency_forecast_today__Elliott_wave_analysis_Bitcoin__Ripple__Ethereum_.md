analysis Bitcoin, Ripple, Ethereum.][2]

The BTCUSD market is likely to be forming a large bear zigzag A-B-C. The
down impulse wave A has completed, and the corrective wave B is still
developing. This correction is forming as a triple zigzag that is
composed of five sub-waves [w]-[x]-[y]-[x]-[z]. After the down linking
wave [x] completed, the final wave [z] has started developing as a
simple zigzag (a)-(b)-(c). Over the next few days, the market may be
rising in the (c) impulse to a level of 7448. After that, the price
should be declining in the C-wave to the previous low made by the A
impulse.

The XRPUSD market is also following a bullish corrective wave that has
started after the down impulse 3 completed. Wave 4 is a triple zigzag
that is composed of five sub-waves [w]-[x]-[y]-[x]-[z]. There is forming
the final leg of this pattern, the bullish zigzag [z]. In the nest few
days, the market should be rising in the (c) wave of this zigzag towards
a level around 0.204, which is the previous high hit during the
formation of the correction 4. After that, the market should turn down
