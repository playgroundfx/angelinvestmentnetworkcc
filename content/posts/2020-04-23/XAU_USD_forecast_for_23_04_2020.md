Gold is being nostalgicDmitri Demidenko

## Gold trends are similar to those of 2009-2011

When the global economy enters the era of monetizing the debt and total
weakness of the world’s major currencies, gold purchases are a good
hedge against the flaws of the financial system. The increase in the US
budget deficit by $4 trillion and the public debt is going to surpass
records set in the post-World War II years require additional issuance
of bonds, whose major buyer is the Fed. The central bank is monetizing
the debt, it doesn’t matter whether through intermediaries or directly.
The Fed’s balance sheet can be boosted up to $9 trillion -$12 trillion
by the end of 2020. The same situation was after the crisis of 2008-2009
when gold hit its record high at $1921.7 per ounce. This time, the gold
price could rise even higher.

According to BofA Merrill Lynch forecasts, an average price for the
precious metal will rise form $1695 in 2020 to $2063 per ounce in 2021
due to the huge fiscal and monetary stimulus, and because of the global
recession. Gold may hit $3000 in eighteen months. The major risks able
to cancel this scenario are a strong dollar, reduced financial market
volatility and lower jewelry demand in India and China

[ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/)s are also bullish on the[ XAU/USD][1]. Total gold held by [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/)s has
hit the highest level since at least April 2019. The holdings have been
growing for 22 consecutive days. State Street’s SPDR Gold Shares [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/) is
on pace for its best month of inflows since 2016, with $4.3 billion
collected so far, according to Bloomberg. Meantime, BlackRock’s iShares
Gold Trust has taken in almost $1.3 billion in April, already its best
month on record.

Remarkably, gold is following the path of US stocks. In March, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s
were selling gold amid the S&P 500 crash in order to hold the opened
position of the securities. In April, however, the market sentiment has
been far more bullish, supported by the Fed, the US administration, and
the hopes for a soon improvement of the epidemiological situation and
the reopening of the US economy. Investors are buying out the equities
hoping that the stock indexes will rebound quicker than the GDP, and
they also buy gold. Gold purchases serve as a hedge against financial
risks resulting from the current uncertainty on how the coronavirus will
impact economic growth.

I think it is natural that the [XAU/USD][1] is moving in sync with the
S&P 500. This happened in 2009-2011 amid the Fed’s quantitative easing
program and low rates in the US bond market. Besides, the size of the
current monetary expansion is much bigger than in those times. It means
the central banks will need more time to start normalizing its monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). That is why the gold uptrend should continue during 2021-2022.

I believe that gold will be trading in the short-term consolidation
range of $1635-$1775, as the US stock indexes are also consolidating. In
the future, the gold price will be rising towards $1850 and $1925, as
the US economic recovery is more likely to be U-shaped.
