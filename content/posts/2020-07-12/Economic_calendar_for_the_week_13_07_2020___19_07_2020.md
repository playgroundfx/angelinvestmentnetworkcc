Economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the week 13.07.2020 – 19.07.2020Jana Kane

##  **Overview of the main events of the Forex economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the
next trading week 13.07.2020 to 19.07.2020**

 **Trading on key Forex [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/): we are expecting the publication of
important macro statistics from the UK, Germany, the US, the Eurozone,
China, Australia and New Zealand, as well as the results of the meeting
of the central banks of Canada, Japan, and the Eurozone.**

Confirmed new coronavirus cases in the US updated the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) high last
week at more than 60,000, according to Johns Hopkins University. In
total, more than 3.22 million people were infected in the United States
and more than 135,000 have already died from coronavirus. The American
stock indexes DJIA and S&P500 were under pressure again last week, but
on Friday ended the day in positive territory. The future of the US
companies is directly dependent on the resumption of economic activity.
But new outbreaks of coronavirus in the US are forcing some state
leaders to reintroduce restrictive measures.

Last week, the spot price of gold exceeded $1818.00 per ounce, which is
the highest mark since October 2009, confirming the prevailing
atmosphere of uncertain prospects for the economy and the stock market,
while [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s fear the second quarantine period.

Next week, the three largest world central banks (Canada, Japan, the
Eurozone) will decide on the interest rate. Investors will also pay
attention to the publication of important macro data from the UK,
Germany, the US, the Eurozone, China, Australia, and New Zealand.

 _ **Traders should pay attention to the following significant
macroeconomic data expected next week:**_

 *** during the coming week new events may be added to the [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) and
scheduled events may be canceled**

 ****** **GMT time**

###  **Monday, July 13**

No important macro statistics planned to be released. However, traders
should pay attention to the speech of the head of the Bank of England
Andrew Bailey, which will begin at 15:30 (GMT). Participants in
financial markets are expecting him to clarify the situation regarding
the further [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the British central bank in the context of
coronavirus and the slowdown of the British economy. Volatility during
his speech could rise sharply in the pound and the London FTSE index if
Andrew Bailey gives any hints of tightening or easing monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).
He will probably also touch on the Brexit issue. As previously stated by
the previous head of the Bank of England Mark Carney, the no-deal exit
from the EU would be a “real economic shock”.

###  **Tuesday, July 14**

Bastille Day - national holiday in France. Banks in this country will be
closed, so trading volumes in the financial market during the European
session will be reduced.

###  **06:00 GBP UK GDP**

GDP is considered an indicator of the general state of the British
economy. A growing trend in GDP is considered positive for the GBP. UK
GDP was one of the highest in the world until 2016, when the Brexit
referendum was held. In the future, its growth slowed down, and with the
onset of the global coronavirus pandemic, the growth rate of British GDP
completely switched to negative territory.

The main factors that can force the Bank of England to keep rates low
are weak growth in GDP, the labor market, and low consumer spending. If
GDP data are weaker than expected, this will put even more downward
pressure on the pound. A strong GDP report will strengthen the pound.
According to the forecast, another decrease in UK GDP is expected in May
(after falling by -20.4% in April). This is a negative factor for the
GBP.

###  **06:00 EUR Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices  (HICP) in Germany
(final release)**

This index is published by the EU Statistical Office and calculated on
the basis of a statistical method agreed between all EU countries. It is
an indicator for assessing inflation used by the Governing Council of
the ECB to assess the level of price stability. A positive result
strengthens the EUR, a negative result weakens it.

In March, the HICP index (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) grew by +1.3%, and in April -
by +0.8%. The preliminary estimate for June was +0.8%. The final value
for June is +0.5%. The euro is unlikely to react very positively to the
publication of this indicator. If the data turn out to be better than
the forecast and preliminary estimates, the euro may strengthen in the
short term. The growth is a positive factor for the euro. However, this
is still not enough to break the negative trend of the euro. Data
suggests low inflationary pressures in Germany.

###  **08:00 EUR Eurozone Bank Lending Survey**

This study of the state of the bank lending system is carried out  by
the EU financial experts 4 times a year. The main objective of the study
is to obtain expanded information on the conditions of bank lending in
the Eurozone.

The data obtained are used by the ECB management in making decisions on
the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the bank. This report may cause an increase in
volatility in the quotations of the euro and on the European stock
market at the time of its publication if it contains unexpected
conclusions regarding the lending conditions for businesses and
households in the Eurozone.

###  **09:00 EUR ZEW Institute Business Sentiment Index in Germany**

This index reflects the difference between the share of optimistic and
pessimistic [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s, thus assessing the mood of [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s and
business. The growth of the indicator and its positive value indicates
an optimistic attitude of [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s, which is a bullish factor for the
EUR. Conversely, a decrease in the indicator and its negative value is a
negative factor for the EUR. In February, the indicator value was 8.7
(against 26.7 in January, 10.7 in December), and in March it was already
-49.5 (with a forecast of -23.4), although in April, May and June it
unexpectedly improved to 28.2, 51.0 and 63.4, respectively. Forecast:
the indicator value for July will be 60.0, which is likely to support
the euro in the short term. If the data turn out to be worse than the
forecast and the previous value, then the euro may decline.

###  **12:30 USD Core Consumer Price Index (ex food and energy)**

Core Consumer Price Index (Core CPI) determines the change in prices of
a selected basket of goods and services for a given period and is a key
indicator for assessing inflation and changing consumer preferences.
Food and energy are excluded from this indicator for a more accurate
estimate. A high result strengthens the US dollar, while a low result
weakens  it. In January, the value of the indicator was +0.2% (+2.3% in
annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)), in February +0.2% and +2.4% (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)), in March
-0.1% (+2.1% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)), in April -0.4% (+1.4% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)).
Forecast for June: +0.1% and +1.3% (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)), which indicates a
slight improvement in the situation after the index fell in March and
April. If the data for June is weaker than the forecast, then the dollar
will most likely respond with a short-term but strong decline. Data
better than forecast will strengthen the dollar.

###  **13:30 CHF Speech by SNB Chairman Thomas Jordan**

During his speech, the volatility of the CHF trade increases, and
traders are waiting for signals regarding further plans of the monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the SNB. The Central Bank of Switzerland has consistently
advocated for a soft monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) in the country, and the national
currency has traditionally been considered "overvalued". Jordan’s tough
rhetoric will strengthen the franc. The soft tone of the speech and the
intention to continue the extra soft monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the SNB will
negatively affect the franc.

###  **Wednesday, July 15**

###  **03:00 JPY Bank of Japan's decision on the interest rate. Bank of
Japan's press conference and monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) comments**

The Bank of Japan will decide on the interest rate. Currently, the main
interest rate in Japan is in negative territory, amounting to -0.1%.
Most likely, the rate will remain the same. If it is reduced and goes
deeper into negative territory, such a decision will cause a sharp
decrease in the yen in the foreign exchange market and growth in the
Japanese stock market. In any case, during this period of time, a jump
in volatility is expected in trading on the yen and on the Asian
financial market.

In June, during its next meeting, the Bank of Japan left the deposit
rate at -0.1%, and the target level of 10-year bond yields at 0%, and
kept the annual target level of [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/) purchases at 12 trillion yen. The
Bank of Japan has expanded its program of assistance to companies
affected by the virus to 110 trillion yen from 75 trillion yen. Under
this program, companies can receive loans without collateral and at a
zero interest rate. The goal of the program is to support commercial
companies whose bankruptcy rates have accelerated rapidly in Japan over
the past month, due to the coronavirus pandemic among other reasons. A
related statement from the Bank of Japan said the bank’s management will
continue to “increase the monetary base until inflation is stable above
2%.” “Without hesitation, we will take additional monetsry easing
measures if necessary,” the bank’s statement also said.

During the press conference, the head of the Bank of Japan Haruhiko
Kuroda will give comments on the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the bank. The Bank
of Japan continues to adhere to its super soft monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). As
Kuroda has repeatedly stated before, “it is appropriate for Japan to
patiently continue the current soft monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).” Markets usually
react actively to Kuroda's speeches. Surely, he will again touch upon
the topic of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) during his speech, which will cause
increased volatility not only in yen trading, but throughout the Asian
and world financial markets.

If the bank's leaders decide that the Japanese economy is stable, and
the momentum of inflation to the target level of 2% does not decrease,
then they will refrain from changing the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).

###  **06:00 JPY Bank of Japan press conference**

During the press conference, head of the Bank of Japan Haruhiko Kuroda
will give comments on the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the bank. Despite earlier
measures taken by the bank to stimulate the Japanese economy, inflation
remains low, production and consumption are falling, which negatively
affects export-oriented Japanese producers. Markets usually react
actively to Kuroda's speeches. If he touches on the topic of monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) during his speech, volatility will increase not only in yen
trading, but also throughout the Asian and world financial markets.

###  **06:00 GBP Consumer Price Index. Core Consumer Price Index**

Consumer Price Index (CPI) reflects the dynamics of retail prices for a
group of goods and services that are part of the British consumer
basket. CPI is a key indicator of inflation. Its publication causes
active movement of the pound in the foreign exchange market, as well as
the London Stock Exchange Index FTSE100.

In the previous reporting month (in May), consumer inflation (in annual
[terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) grew by 0.5%.

Forecast for June: +0.5% (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)). This value is unlikely to
provide significant support to the pound. An indicator below the
forecast may trigger the weakening of the pound, as low inflation will
force the Bank of England to maintain a soft monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).

Core CPI is published by the Office for National Statistics and
determines the change in prices of a selected basket of goods and
services (except food and energy) for a given period. It is a key
indicator for assessing inflation and changing consumer preferences. A
positive result strengthens the GBP, a negative result weakens it.

In May, Core CPI (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) grew by +1.2%. It is likely that the
publication of the indicator will positively affect the pound if its
value is higher than the forecast and the previous value. Forecast for
June: +1.3% (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)). An indicator below the forecast and / or
previous values ​​can trigger the weakening of the pound.

###  **14:00 CAD Bank of Canada's interest rate decision. Bank of
Canada's accompanying statement**

The Bank of Canada will decide on the interest rate. In March, the bank
lowered the rate 3 times, bringing it to the level of 0.25%, to mitigate
the economic damage from the pandemic of the novel coronavirus.

In a companion statement, the Central Bank of Canada stated that this
"decision is aimed at supporting the financial system, which plays a
central role in lending to the economy, as well as creating the
foundation that will allow the economy to return to normal." A press
release of the central bank also said that the spread of coronavirus and
a sharp drop in world oil prices in the aggregate are putting serious
pressure on Canadians and the Canadian economy.

"I will not argue about describing these actions as QE," said Stephen
Poloz, the head of the Bank of Canada at that time (since June 3, 2020,
this post has been held by Tiff Macklem). If the government bond market
"does not work smoothly, with a narrow spread of supply and demand, then
the rest of the system also does not work as it should," said Poloz,
explaining the need for QE.

Initially, at least 5 billion Canadian dollars per week will be
allocated for these purposes (purchase conditions will be adjusted to
reflect the changing situation).

Quantitative easing and a significant reduction in interest rates should
help weaken the national currency.

The consequences of coronavirus on the Canadian economy and the
country's labor market (in March, unemployment rose to 7.8% from 5.6% in
February, and the number of employees, according to Statistics Canada,
decreased by 1.01 million people), as well as weak housing market are
putting pressure on the Bank of Canada to further soften its monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).

Nevertheless, it is expected that at a meeting on Wednesday the Bank of
Canada will maintain an interest rate of 0.25%.

Tough tone of the Bank of Canada's accompanying statement regarding
rising inflation and the prospects for further monetary tightening will
trigger a strengthening of the Canadian dollar. If the Bank of Canada
signals a soft monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), the Canadian currency will decline.

###  **14:00 CAD Bank of Canada Monetary Policy Report**

The Bank of Canada's Monetary Policy Committee will issue a regular
quarterly report on current monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) issues containing
information on changes in monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). In this report,
representatives of the Bank of Canada will explain the bank’s position
and assess the current economic situation in the country. The harsh tone
of the report will cause the strengthening of the Canadian dollar. If
signals from the Bank of Canada extend the period of soft monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), the Canadian currency will decline.

###  **15:15 CAD Bank of Canada's press conference**

During the press conference, the head of the Bank of Canada Tiff Macklem
will explain the position of the bank and assess the current economic
situation in the country. If the tone of his speech is tough in relation
to the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the Bank of Canada, the Canadian dollar will
strengthen in the foreign exchange market. If Macklem favors maintaining
a soft monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), the Canadian currency will decline. In any case,
during his speech, high volatility in the CAD quotes is expected.

###  **22:45 NZD CPI (Consumer Price Index) for the 2nd quarter**

Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a key indicator for assessing inflation
that reflects the dynamics of retail prices for a group of goods and
services that are part of the consumer basket. A positive result
strengthens the NZD, a negative result weakens it. Forecast: +0.4%
(versus +0.8% in the 1st quarter, +0.5% in the 4th quarter, +0.7% in the
3rd quarter). A relative decrease in the indicator may adversely affect
the NZD quotes. In annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/), CPI grew in the 2nd quarter, as
expected, by +2.1% (against +2.5% in the 1st quarter, +1.9% in the 4th
quarter, +1.5% in 3rd quarter). Data worse than forecast will negatively
affect the NZD.

###  **Thursday, July 16**

###  **01:30 AUD Employment rate. Unemployment rate**

Employment rates reflect the monthly change in the number of Australian
citizens employed. The growth of the indicator has a positive effect on
consumer spending, which stimulates economic growth. A high value is a
positive factor for the AUD, and a low value is negative. Forecast: in
June, the number of employed Australian citizens decreased by another
100,000 (after rising in March by 5,900 and falling in April by 594,300
and in May - by 227,700).

Also at the same time, the Australian Bureau of Statistics will publish
a report on the unemployment rate - an indicator that estimates the
share of the unemployed to the total number of able-bodied citizens. The
growth rate indicates a weak labor market, which leads to a weakening of
the national economy. The decline is a positive factor for the AUD.
Forecast: unemployment in Australia in June was at the level of 7.0%
(against 6.2% in April, 5.2% in March, 5.1% in February). In general,
the indicators can be described as negative. However, in other large
economies, the labor market has deteriorated on an even larger scale due
to coronavirus.

The RBA's leaders have repeatedly stated that in addition to the
situation in international trade, the Australian economy and central
bank monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) plans are influenced by the level of debts and
household expenses, the growth of workers' salaries, as well as the
state of the country's labor market.

In March 2020, the RB of Australia lowered its key interest rate by
0.50% to a new record low of 0.25% due to coronavirus, which was the 5th
rate cut in the last year. According to the RBA leaders, an unemployment
rate of 4.5% or lower is needed to increase wages and accelerate
inflation to the target range. Unemployment in the country is not
declining, and the return of inflation to the middle of the target range
of 2-3% is not even on a distant horizon.

The AUD is unlikely to respond positively to the publication of data
from the country's labor market. If the values ​​of the indicators turn
out to be worse than the forecast, then the Australian dollar may
decrease significantly in the short term. Data better than forecast will
strengthen the AUD in the short term.

###  **02:00 CNY Q2 China's GDP**

The National Bureau of Statistics of China will present data on GDP
growth in the 2nd quarter.

In the 1st quarter of China's GDP decreased by -9.8% (-6.8% in annual
[terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)), in the 3rd and 4th quarters of 2019 GDP growth was +1.5% and
+6.0%, respectively. Chinese GDP is expected to decline in the 2nd
quarter of 2020 by -9.9 %% (-6.5% year on year).

China is the largest buyer of commodities and a supplier to the global
commodity market of finished products of a wide range. China's economy
is the second largest in the world after the American one. Therefore,
the publication of important macroeconomic indicators from China can
have a strong impact on the entire financial market.

The relative decline in GDP may negatively affect the yuan quotes, as
well as the prices of commodity currencies and currencies of the Asia-
Pacific region, as may indicate a slowdown in the Chinese economy.

The growth of the indicator will positively affect the Chinese yuan, as
well as the world, primarily Asian stock indices, as well as commodity
currencies, such as New Zealand and Australian dollars. China is the
largest trade and economic partner of Australia and New Zealand and a
buyer of commodities from these countries.

Therefore, negative macro statistics from China may also negatively
affect the quotes of these commodity currencies.

###  **06:00 GBP Report on the average wages of the British citizens
over the past 3 months. Unemployment rate**

Every month, the UK Office for National Statistics (ONS) publishes an
average earnings report that includes the period for the last 3 months,
with and without bonuses.

This report is a key short-term indicator of the dynamics of changes in
the level of wages of employees in the UK. Wages growth is a positive
factor for the GBP, and a low indicator value is negative. Forecast: the
July report suggests that the average wages with bonuses have grown over
the past 3 months (March-May) by 1.4% (against +1.0%, +2.4%, +2.8% ,
+3.1%, +2.9%, +3.2%, +3.2% in previous periods); without bonuses - by
1.9% (against +1.7%, +2.7%, +2.9%, +3.1%, +3.2%, +3.4%, +3.5 % in
previous periods). These are still positive data despite the fact that
they are below average values. If the data is better than expected, the
pound is likely to strengthen in the foreign exchange market.

Also at this time, the office publishes data on unemployment in the UK.
Over the 3 months from March to May, unemployment is expected to be at
4.7% (against 3.9%, 4.0%, 3.9% and 3.8% in previous periods). Since
2012, the UK unemployment rate has been steadily declining (from 8.0% in
September 2012). This is a positive factor for the pound, however,
unemployment growth over the last reporting period is a negative factor.

If the data from the UK labor market turn out to be worse than the
forecast and / or the previous value, then the pound will be under
pressure.

In any case, at the time of publication of data from the British labor
market, volatility is expected to increase in pound quotes and on the
London Stock Exchange.

###  **11:45 EUR ECB's decision on the interest rates**

The ECB will publish its decision on the key rate and deposit rate. The
ECB's tough stance on inflation and the level of key interest rates
helps strengthen the euro, while the soft stance and lower interest
rates weaken the euro. In September 2019, the European Central Bank
lowered its key interest rate on deposits by 0.1% to -0.5% and began
buying bonds by 20 billion euros per month, renewing the so-called
quantitative easing program.

At a subsequent press conference, the former president of the European
Central Bank Mario Draghi said that the balance of risks for the
economic outlook of the Eurozone “is still shifted in the negative
direction”, implying the possibility of additional stimulation if
necessary.

The ECB's rate cut in September was the first since March 2016, and
“until inflation complies” with the target level, which is slightly
below 2%, the rate will remain low. Now inflation in the Eurozone is
stubbornly remaining around 1%, and the ECB's new forecasts on rates and
the QE program can be seen as a signal of a tendency to further soften
the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).

After Brexit, the escalation of trade conflicts and factors of political
instability in the Eurozone are the main threats to the European
economy.

Speaking earlier in the European Parliament, Christine Lagarde, who in
November became the new president of the European Central Bank, said the
stimulus measures of the ECB monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) continue to have a
beneficial effect on the economy of the Eurozone. “I agree with the ECB
Governing Council that a stimulating monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) will remain
appropriate for a long period of time,” Lagarde said.

An additional factor that could put pressure on the ECB towards further
easing of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) was the coronavirus pandemic. Back in March,
the ECB signaled the possibility of easing the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), and the bank
representative admitted that the bank's management may lower already
negative interest rates even lower.

It is likely that following the meeting of the ECB, the key interest
rate will remain at the same level of 0%. The ECB deposit rate for
commercial banks is also likely to remain at -0.5%. At the same time, it
is highly likely that at this meeting the ECB will announce a new
program to stimulate the economy.

###  **12:30 EUR ECB's press conference**

During the press conference, a surge in volatility is possible not only
in euro quotes, but also across the entire financial market, if the ECB
leaders make an unexpected statement. Similar previous decisions by the
ECB on interest rates and subsequent press conferences moved the euro by
3-5% in a short time. The ECB executives will assess the current
economic situation in the Eurozone and comment on the ECB's decision on
rates.

The soft tone of the statements will have a negative impact on the euro.
And, on the contrary, the tough tone of the speech of the
representatives of the ECB leaders regarding the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the
central bank will strengthen the euro.

###  **12:30 USD Initial jobless claims in the US over the past week.
Retail sales (ex autos). Retail Control Group**

The situation on the country's labor market is still deteriorating. Back
in February, the value of initial jobless claims was within its average
values ​​of 193-252 thousand. However, then the situation began to
deteriorate sharply. Over the week of March 22-28, 6.9 million claims
were submitted, then 6.606 million claims, shocking observers and market
participants. A similar indicator published last Thursday (for the week
of June 28-July 03) came out with a value of 1.344 million claims.

The US Department of Labor data published in early May showed an
increase in unemployment in the country to the level of 14.7%.
Economists attribute this to the coronavirus, which has damaged the US
economy. Many US companies announced layoffs, and authorities ordered
non-vital companies to close their offices and stores in the wake of the
coronavirus epidemic. Current weekly growth rates of applications far
exceed the previous record level of 695,000, reached in October 1982.
Then the number of initial claims filed in four weeks was 2.7 million.

This indicator reflects the state of the labor market. An increase in
value negatively affects consumption and economic growth. Under normal
conditions, a high result weakens the US dollar, while a low one
strengthens it. However, in the current environment (the coronavirus
pandemic and a sharp economic slowdown), the reaction of market
participants to the publication of this report by the US Department of
Labor can be completely unpredictable.

 **Retail sales (ex autos). Retail Control Group**

This report (Core Retail Sales Ex Autos) reflects the total sales of
retailers of all sizes and types, with the exception of car dealerships.
The change in retail sales is a major indicator of consumer spending.
The report is leading, and in the future the data can be greatly
revised. A high result strengthens the US dollar, a low one weakens it.
A relative decrease in the indicator may have a short-term negative
impact on the dollar, and an increase in the indicator will positively
affect the USD. In the previous month (May), the indicator increased by
+12.4% (against a decrease of -17.2% in April, -4.5% in March, -0.4% in
February).

Retail sales are the main indicator of consumer spending in the United
States showing changes in retail sales. The Retail Control Group measure
measures the volume of the entire retail industry and is used to
calculate price indices for most products. A strong result strengthens
the US dollar, and vice versa, a weak report weakens the dollar. A
slight increase in indicators is unlikely to give acceleration to the
growth of the dollar. Data is worse than the previous period (+11% in
May, -15.3% in April, +1.7% in March, 0.0% in January and February) will
negatively affect the dollar in the short term.

###  **Friday, July 17**

###  **00:00** **EUR Special European Council**

This summit will gather finance ministers and EU leaders. The purpose of
this summit will be to discuss the situation in the global economy and a
plan to save Greece from the debt crisis. The summit will last all day.
After the summit, an official statement is published on the objectives
and results of the meeting, which may have an impact on European and
global financial markets.

###  **12:30 CAD Retail Sales Index**

The Retail Sales Index is published monthly by Statistics Canada and
estimates total retail sales. The index is often considered an indicator
of consumer confidence and reflects the state of the retail sector in
the near future. Index growth is usually a positive factor for the CAD;
a decrease in the indicator will negatively affect the CAD. Previous
index value (for April): 19.1% (after -26.4% in March). If the data for
May is weaker than the previous value, the CAD may drop sharply in the
short term.
