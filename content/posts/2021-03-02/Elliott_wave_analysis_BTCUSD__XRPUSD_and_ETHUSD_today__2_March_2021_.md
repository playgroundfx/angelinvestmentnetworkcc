Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 02.03.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

The Ripple price chart is forming the final leg of the bearish impulse.
Bitcoin and Ethereum continue forming the linking waves in the double
zigzags.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

The BTCUSD market finished a large upward impulse wave, which is
composed of the sub-waves [1]-[2]-[3]-[4]-[5]. Next, the market has
started declining, forming a bearish double zigzag. The first sub-wave
of this zigzag, wave [W], has completed. Wave [W] is also a double
zigzag. The Bitcoin price is rising in the linking wave [X], which
should end at a level of 52500.00, a little higher than the previous
high marked by wave (X). At level 52500.00, wave [X] will reach the
Fibonacci ratio of 61.8% of wave [W].

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 49100.50, TP 52500.00

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

After the linking down wave (X) finished, there has started a new
downward zigzag, composed of the sub-waves [A]-[B]-[C]. There have
completed wave [A] and the upward corrective wave [B], which is a triple
zigzag. The price is now declining in wave [C], which is an impulse.
Corrective wave (4) of impulse [C] is a skewed triangle and seems to
have completed. Therefore, the market should be declining in the final
wave (5) towards a level of 0.300.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] today:

Sell 0.441, TP 0.300

* * *

## Elliott wave Ethereum analysis

After a large bullish wave C completed as a five-wave impulse, there has
started unfolding a new corrective pattern. There is likely to be
forming a bearish double zigzag W-X-Y. The first zigzag-shaped W looks
complete, so the price is now rising in wave X. The price is expected to
reach the high at 1710.00, made by correction [B]. At level 1710.00,
wave X will slightly exceed the Fibonacci level of 50% of wave W.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Buy 1567.49, TP 1710.00
