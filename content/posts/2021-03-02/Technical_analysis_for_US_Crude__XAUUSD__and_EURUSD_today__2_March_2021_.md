Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 02.03.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

The trading recommendation for selling oil in Additional Zone [62.48 -
62.36] yielded profits, even greater than expected.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

The trading recommendation for selling oil in Additional Zone [62.48 -
62.36] yielded profits, even greater than expected. The Friday low has
been updated. The Intermediary Zone [61.44 - 61.22] was broken out with
further consolidation at the US trading session. The short-term oil
trend reversed down.

Today the target for sales is the lower Target Zone [59.18 - 58.73]. It
is possible to enter short trades in the nearest resistance which is
Additional Zone [60.58 - 60.47]. The border of the new trend is located
between the levels [61.83 - 61.60].

Wait for the price correction to resistances, look for a pattern, and
sell oil.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

  1. Sell according to the pattern in Additional Zone [60.58 - 60.47]. TakeProfit: Target Zone [59.18 - 58.73]. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. Sell according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone [61.83 - 61.60]. TakeProfit: Target Zone [59.18 - 58.73]. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

Gold bears updated Friday's low. Now they are trying to break out the
support of the Gold Zone [1725 - 1720]. If the US trading session closes
below the Gold Zone, Target Zone 2 [1675 - 1665] will be the next sell
target.

The short-term trend remains down, so enter sales on correction at the
strong resistance. The nearest “intraday” resistance is the Additional
Zone [1737 - 1734]. The trend border is located at the levels [1767 -
1762].

Wait for a correction, look for a pattern and sell gold to update the
low.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

  1. Sell according to the pattern in Additional Zone [1737 - 1734]. TakeProfit: 1708. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. Sell according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone [1767 - 1762]. TakeProfit: 1708. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

The EURUSD bears broke out the Target Zone [1.2082 - 1.2066] and
consolidated below. The next sell target within the short-term downtrend
is the Gold Zone [1.2002 - 1.1994].

Look for new sales on the correction. When the upward movement develops,
look for the sellers' reaction after the test of the Additional Zone
[1.2059 - 1.2055] and Intermediary Zone [1.2103 - 1.2095]. If a pattern
appears, it will be possible to open a short position to update the
day's low.

Euro purchases according to the methodology are not yet possible.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

  1. Sell according to the pattern in Additional Zone [1.2059 - 1.2055]. TakeProfit: 1.2016. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. Sell according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone [1.2103 - 1.2095]. TakeProfit: 1.2016. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.
