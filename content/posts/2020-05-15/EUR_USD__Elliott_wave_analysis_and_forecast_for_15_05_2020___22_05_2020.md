EUR/USD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 15/05/2020 –
22/05/2020Alex Geuta

## [EUR/USD][1] remains likely to fall. Estimated pivot point is at a
level of 1.0899.

 **Main scenario:** Consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 1.0899 with a target of 1.0633 – 1.0528.

 **Alternative scenario:** ****breakout and consolidation above the
level of 1.0899 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of
1.1064 – 1.1170.

 **Analysis:** Supposedly, a descending fifth wave of larger degree (5)
of С continues developing on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame, with the first wave 1
of (5) and correction 2 of (5) formed inside. The third wave 3 of (5)
started developing on the H4 time frame, with an ascending correction
developed in the form of wave ii of 3 inside. Apparently, the third wave
iii of 3 started developing on the H1 time frame, with wave (ii) of iii
formed inside. If the presumption is correct, the pair will continue to
drop to the levels of 1.0633 – 1.0528. The level of 1.0899 is critical
in this scenario. Its breakout will allow the pair to continue rising to
the levels of 1.1064 – 1.1170.
