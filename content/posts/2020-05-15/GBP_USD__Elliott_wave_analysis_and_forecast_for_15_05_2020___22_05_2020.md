GBP/USD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 15/05/2020 –
22/05/2020Alex Geuta

## [GBP/USD][1] is correcting, still likely to fall. Estimated pivot
point is at a level of 1.2469.

 **Main scenario:** consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 1.2469 with a target of 1.2021 – 1.1871.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
1.2469 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 1.2728 –
1.3201.

 **Analysis:** Supposedly, the fifth wave of larger degree V finished
developing on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame, with wave  (С) of V completed
inside. The first wave (1) is developing on the H4 time frame, with wave
1 of (1) formed and a local correction developing as wave 2 of (1)
inside. Apparently, wave c of 2 is developing on the H1 time frame, with
wave (iii) of c of 2 forming inside. If the presumption is correct, the
price will continue falling to the levels of 1.2021 – 1.1871. The level
of 1.2469 is critical in this scenario as the breakout will enable the
pair to continue rising to the levels of 1.2728 – 1.3201
