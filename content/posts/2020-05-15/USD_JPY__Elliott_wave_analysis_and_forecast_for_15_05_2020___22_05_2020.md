USD/JPY: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 15/05/2020 –
22/05/2020Alex Geuta

## [USD/JPY][1] is likely to grow. Estimated pivot point is at a level
of 105.96.

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions from corrections above the
level of 105.96 with a target of 109.51 – 111.80.

 **Alternative scenario:** ****breakout and consolidation below the
level of 105.96 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels
of 103.00 – 101.08.

 **Analysis:** On the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame, apparently a descending
correction of senior level finished forming as wave B and wave С started
developing. On the H4 time frame, the first wave 1 of (1) of C formed
and a local correction finished forming as wave 2 of (1). Apparently,
wave 3 of (1) started developing on the H1 time frame, with wave i of 3
forming inside. If this assumption is correct, the pair will continue to
rise to 109.51 – 111.80. The level of 105.96 is critical in this
scenario as the breakout will enable the pair to continue declining to
the levels of 103.00 – 101.08.
