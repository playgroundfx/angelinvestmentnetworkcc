XAU/USD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 15/05/2020 –
22/05/2020Alex Geuta

## [XAU/USD][1] remains likely to grow. Estimated pivot point is at a
level of 1669.96.

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions from corrections above the
level of 1669.96 with a target of 1800.00 – 1850.00.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
1669.96 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of
1561.72 – 1450.00.

 **Analysis:** Supposedly, an ascending correction of larger degree
continues developing in the form of wave (B) on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame,
with wave С of (B) forming within. Apparently, the fifth wave v of C is
developing on the H4 time frame, with a local correction formed inside
as wave (iv) of v. The fifth wave of smaller degree  (v) of v started
developing on the H1 time frame.  If this assumption is correct, the
pair will continue to rise to 1800.00 – 1850.00. The level of 1669.96 is
critical in this scenario as the breakout will enable the pair to
continue declining to the levels of 1561.72 – 1450.00.
