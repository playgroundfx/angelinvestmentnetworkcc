Euro is rolling down. Forecast as of 10.11.2020Dmitri Demidenko

The EURUSD drop has broken many laws of the market analysis. However,
markets are growing on the rumors and falling on the facts. Speculators
have exhausted the factor of Joe Biden’s victory. Let us discuss the
Forex outlook and make up a [EURUSD][1] trading plan.

##  ** **Weekly** **euro** **fundamental analysis****

The euro crash has confused the world’s media. The press and analysts
cannot really explain what happened in the trading session on November
9. The [EURUSD][1] has dropped to the bottom of figure 18 despite the
continuous growth of the US stocks, strong yuan, and hopes for the
global economy’s recovery. Positive [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) about the COVID-19 vaccine
allowed the Dow Jones to break through the February highs; the [S&P
500][2] hit the second record high. The stock indices’ rally usually
encourages [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s to sell off safe-havens, which is evident from the
Japanese yen's drop. However, the dollar has surprisingly strengthened
against the euro. What’s the matter?

Is the reason for the [EURUSD][1] drop in Asia? No, it isn’t. The yuan
is the strongest ever. China expects Joe Biden to ease the tariffs
imposed by Trump, which sends the renminbi up. Is Brexit the reason? No,
it isn’t. Boris Johnson lost to parliament, which did not want to ratify
his controversial internal market draft bill. The pound has increased in
value, which usually supports the euro. Maybe, the euro has fallen
because the EU introduced retaliatory tariffs on the US imports worth $4
billion after the WTO granted permission to do it as a countermeasure
for illegal subsidies to Boeing. Do the markets worry about an EU-US
trade war? I don’t think so; the total amount of tariffs is too small to
result in a trade war.

Perhaps, the reason is the rumors about ECB’s aggressive monetary
expansion in December? Bloomberg’s experts forecast the QE boost by €500
billion. Furthermore, European Central Bank Chief Economist Philip Lane
said there's still room to cut interest rates further. The markets
expect pathetic speeches and active measures from Christine Lagarde and
her colleagues. Nonetheless, it is not a new factor.

I believe the trading session on November 9 performed the working out of
the investment idea that I have been writing about for several days
already. The [EURUSD][1] forecasts were bullish, suggesting the euro
should rise in cases of Biden’s victory (for example, the idea of dollar
weakening amid the widening of the US twin deficit). That is why large
traders utilized the strategy ‘buy on the rumors, sell on the facts.’
The greenback should have started growing despite the opinion of the
majority. The main idea was to catch the crowd off guard, and it has
worked perfectly. Next, speculators expect the correction to continue
amid the deterioration of the euro-area epidemiological situation.

The matter is that the positive [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) about the vaccine limits the euro’s
correction. The victory over the coronavirus will allow canceling
lockdown in Europe. I expect to repeat the [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) of the third quarter
when the euro rose against the US dollar amid more effective management
of the pandemic in the euro area than in the USA. The correction could
go deeper only because of the pessimism about vaccines.

###  ** **Weekly[EURUSD][1] trading plan****

The [EURUSD][1] bulls failed to hold up the price above 1.188. [As
expected][3], it resulted in a drawdown to the bottom of figure 18. If
the price breaks out the support at 1.1795-1.18, it should roll down to
1.176 and 1.1725. Otherwise, if the pair goes up above 1.1865, it could
well continue the rally.
