Gold pays the debts back. 10.11.2020Dmitri Demidenko

Many bullish factors are already price in the XAUUSD. The hope for the
global economic recovery as vaccines are being developed encourages
speculators to exit gold longs. Let us discuss gold prospects and make
up a [XAUUSD][1] trading plan.

## Monthly gold fundamental forecast

Gold is rolling down, and my forecast comes true. [Just a few days
ago][2], I recommended selling gold on the rebound from the resistance
at $1965. Gold has been more than 5% down, and one could have made quite
a lot of money on this strategy. Most of the positive factors have
already been priced in the [XAUUSD][1]. The good [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) about COVID-19
vaccines has crashed the gold prices.

Gold trades could face the same situation as it was in 2011. 9 years
ago, the global economy was recovering after the recession; massive
fiscal and monetary stimuli weakened the world’s major currencies and
fueled up inflation expectations, which was a bullish factor for the
[XAUUSD][1]. However, consumer prices grew very slowly, and the gold
uptrend broke down. In 2020, the hopes for the expansion of financial
aid to at least $2 trillion encouraged the gold bulls to go ahead.
Nonetheless, the divided congress and the information about vaccines set
the gold buyers back.

The gold uptrend seemed to base on a strong foundation. The monetary
stimuli now are the biggest ever, which boosts the central banks’
balance sheets, weakening the global currencies and increasing the
volume of negative-yielding bonds up to a record high of $17.05
trillion.

Nonetheless, the situation cannot be stable by its nature, and it is
going to change.

First, grate money supplies provided by central banks turned out into a
liquidity trap. Additional monetary stimuli won’t be as effective as
they used to be. It is evident from the reaction of the Australian
dollar and the British pound to the monetary easing performed by the RBA
and the BoE. These currencies strengthened, though they should have
weakened under normal conditions. Regulators are more likely to change
the structure of the QE rather than the volumes. The balance sheets
should not increase as fast as before.

Second, Joe Biden’s victory along with the divided Congress lowers the
chances of a massive fiscal stimulus. The gold bulls’ hopes for the
reflationary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), which could have been performed along with the
presence of the ‘blue wave’, haven’t met the reality. That is why the
speculators are exiting the gold longs.

Finally, if the information about the effectiveness of the OCVID-19
vaccine is true, the global economic recovery will drive the global bond
market rates up and encourage [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s to sell off the [XAUUSD][1].
Gold uptrend might recover only if the dollar is weak, but that will
hardly happen soon. The dollar should weaken against the euro only
provided the EU cancels the restrictions.

### Monthly gold trading plan

I recommend holding down the shorts entered [at level $1965][2]. It will
be relevant to add up to the sell positions if the price fails to break
out the resistance at $1900 and $1915 or tests the supports at $1875 and
$1860.
