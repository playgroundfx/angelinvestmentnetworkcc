Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 10.11.2020Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I suggest entry signals
to trade each cryptocurrency.

The most recent chart sections of the three major cryptocurrencies show
the formation of the initial parts of bullish impulses. So, the prices
should grow in the near future.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

The BTCUSD market is forming the final zigzag A-B-C, which is an element
of the double zigzag of a larger degree. The two-hour timeframe displays
the final leg of the triangle correction B, which was followed by the
upward impulse wave C. The first four parts should have completed within
the C wave. The market is now forming the final section of wave [5],
which is a bullish impulse (5). The price should continue growing up to
level 16700.00.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 15345.25, TP 16700.00

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

 ****

The XRPUSD market is forming the middle part of the simple down zigzag.
It means there is developing the upward corrective wave (B) as a simple
zigzag A-B-C. The bearish correction B has recently completed as a
triple zigzag. The price is now growing in the bullish impulse wave C
that is composed of the sub-waves [1]-[2]-[3]-[4]-[5]. The final wave
[5] should be rising to a level of 0.272.

### Trading plan for **[XRPUSD][2]** today:

Buy 0.251, TP 0.272

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

 ****

The ETHUSD market is forming the upward simple zigzag, with the bullish
wave C developing inside as a simple impulse. A deep corrective wave [4]
has recently finished as a triple zigzag. The market is now rising in
the impulse wave [5]. The Ethereum price could be growing to a level of
507.00, which is a little higher than the previous high made by the A
impulse.

### Trading plan for  **[ETHUSD][3] **today:

Buy 446.88, TP 507.00
