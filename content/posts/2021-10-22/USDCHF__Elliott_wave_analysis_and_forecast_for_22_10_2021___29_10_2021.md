USDCHF: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 22.10.2021 –
29.10.2021Alex Geuta

 **Main scenario:** Consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 0.9366 with a target of 0.8924 – 0.8766.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
0.9366 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 0.9506 –
0.9685.

 **Analysis:** [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) chart: apparently, the first wave of larger degree
(1) of 5 is formed, a correction is completed as the second wave (2) of
5, and the third wave (3) of 5 has started developing, with wave 1 of
(3) already formed inside. On the H4 chart, a local correction has
developed as the second wave 2 of (3), with wave c of 2 formed inside.
Apparently, the third wave 3 of (3) is developing on the H1 chart, with
wave i of 3 forming inside. If the presumption is correct, the pair will
continue to drop to the levels of 0.8924 – 0.8766. The level of 0.9366
is critical in this scenario. Its breakout will allow the pair to
continue rising to the levels of 0.9506 – 0.9685.
