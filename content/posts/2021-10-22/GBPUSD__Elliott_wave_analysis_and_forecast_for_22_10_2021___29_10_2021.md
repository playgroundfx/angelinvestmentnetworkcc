GBPUSD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 22.10.2021 –
29.10.2021Alex Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 1.3909 with a target of 1.3400 – 1.3157.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
1.3909 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 1.4050 –
1.4241.

 **Analysis:** [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) chart: the first wave of larger degree (1) has
formed and a downside correction continues forming as wave (2). H4
chart: waves A of (2) and B of (2) are formed, and wave C of (2) is
developing. On the H1 chart, the third wave of smaller degree iii of C
appears to have formed, and a local correction is presumably completed
as wave iv of C. If this assumption is correct, the pair will continue
to fall to 1.3400 – 1.3157. The level of 1.3909 is critical in this
scenario as a breakout will enable the pair to continue rising to the
levels of 1.4050 – 1.4241.
