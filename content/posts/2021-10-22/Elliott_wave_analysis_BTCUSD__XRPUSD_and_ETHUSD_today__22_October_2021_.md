Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 22.10.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

Bitcoin and Ethereum seem to be forming bearish trends. Therefore, the
prices should continue falling.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

The BTCUSD market is forming a global corrective trend, with a large
corrective wave [B] completed inside. The [B] correction is composed of
sub-waves (A)-(B)-(C). In the most recent chart section, the market has
turned down and started declining in the new down wave. The price should
continue declining to a level of 59800.00.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Sell 63136.50, TP 59800.00

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

The XRPUSD market completed the motive wave W. Next, the market has
started rising in the linking wave X, unfolding as a zigzag [A]-[B]-[C].
The final sub-wave of the [C] impulse is developing as an ending
diagonal 1-2-3-4-5, which could end at a level around 1.2253, market by
sub-wave (3). One could enter buy trades in the current situation.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] **** today:

Buy 1.104, TP 1.236

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

It is clear from the hourly ETHUSD price chart that there is forming a
corrective trend, with corrective wave B completed inside. The chart
displays the second half of this correction, the final part of the [B]
correction, and the entire impulse wave [C]. Currently, the initial part
of the new bearish trend is developing. The Ethereum price should be
declining to the previous low of 3670.00, marked by correction 4.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Sell 4148.00, TP 3670.00
