EURUSD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 22.10.2021 –
29.10.2021Alex Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 1.1761 with a target of 1.1488 – 1.1287.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
1.1761 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 1.2090 –
1.2269.

 **Analysis:** [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) chart: the first wave of larger degree 1 of (3) is
formed, and a downside correction continues forming as wave 2 of (3),
with wave c of 2 unfolding as part of it. The third wave of smaller
degree (iii) of c appears to have formed on the H4 chart. Apparently, a
local correction has finished forming as wave (iv) of с on the H1 chart.
If this assumption is correct, the pair will continue falling to the
levels of 1.1488 – 1.1287. The level of 1.1761 is critical in this
scenario. Its breakout will allow the pair to continue rising to the
levels of 1.2090 – 1.2269.
