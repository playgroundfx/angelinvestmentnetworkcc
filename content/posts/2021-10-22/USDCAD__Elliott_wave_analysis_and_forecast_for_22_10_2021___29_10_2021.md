USDCAD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 22.10.2021 –
29.10.2021Alex Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 1.2500 with a target of 1.2250 – 1.2150.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
1.2500 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 1.2647 –
1.2773.

 **Analysis:** a descending correction appears to have formed as the
fourth wave 4 of larger degree on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) chart, with wave (С) of 4
completed and wave 5 unfolding inside. H4 chart: wave 1 of (1) of 5 is
formed, and a downward correction is developing as wave 2 of (1) of 5,
with wave c of 2 unfolding as part of it. Apparently, the third wave of
smaller degree (iii) of c has finished forming on the H1 chart, and a
corrective wave (iv) of c has started developing. If the presumption is
correct, the pair will continue falling to the levels of 1.2250 – 1.2150
after the corrective wave (iv) of c is formed. The level of 1.2500 is
critical in this scenario as a breakout will enable the pair to continue
rising to the levels of 1.2647 – 1.2773.
