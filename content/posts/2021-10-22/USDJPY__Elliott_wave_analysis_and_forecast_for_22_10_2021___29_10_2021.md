USDJPY: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 22.10.2021 –
29.10.2021Alex Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions from corrections above the
level of 112.30 with a target of 115.00 – 116.00.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
112.30 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of 110.83
– 109.012.

 **Analysis:** [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) chart: there's an ascending wave of larger degree C
that presumably has started forming. The third wave 3 of (1) of С is
unfolding as part of the wave C. H4 chart: a correction is completed as
wave ii of 3, and wave iii of 3 is forming. On the H1 chart, apparently,
wave (iii) of iii is formed, and a local correction is developing as
wave (iv) of iii. If the presumption is correct, the pair will continue
to rise to the levels of 115.00 – 116.00 after the correction is
completed. The level of 112.30 is critical in this scenario as its
breakout will enable the pair to continue declining to the levels of
110.83 – 109.012.
