Ethereum Price Predictions: 2021 and BeyondJana Kane

Various cryptos are trying to overthrow ETH. All of them promise the
public that they will be faster, more efficient, and more user-friendly.
None, however, come close to the popularity of Ethereum. This won't
change in 2021 either, because exciting things are planned. Which ones?
Keep on reading! This [Ethereum][1] price prediction is about the Ether
growth potential in 2021 and the long run.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Ethereum in Short

Like Bitcoin, Ethereum is a separate [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) that has its own digital
currency. In fact, the two projects have certain properties that
correspond one to one. For example, both coins are decentralized. No
country or government backs Bitcoin or Ethereum. Furthermore, both
digital currencies are built on [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) technology so that all
transactions are fast, accurate, and transparent.

However, this is where the similarities end. Ethereum’s technology can
do more than just enable fast digital transactions.

For example, Ethereum offers [smart contract](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/smart-contract-on-blockchain/) technology. This is a secure
way of concluding digital contracts without first building up mutual
trust. Ethereum transfers are also faster than Bitcoin's, and its
[blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) technology can handle more transactions than Bitcoin's.

Most people buy Ethereum on a speculative basis. That means that people
invest in the crypto coin to make money from it.

## Importance of the Network Effect

The biggest advantage of Ethereum is the network effect. It is the first
and, therefore, the [most popular][2] [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) for [smart contract](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/smart-contract-on-blockchain/)s.
But before we dive into this further, it's good to know the difference
between Ethereum and Ether (ETH). These [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) are often used
interchangeably.

By Ethereum, we mean the network and the [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/). You can find all
transactions of a cryptocurrency on a [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/). And on Ethereum,
transactions are paid with ETH. That is the cryptocurrency that comes
with Ethereum. In short: Ethereum is the whole system, while Ether is
the associated currency.

## A Little History of Ethereum

Unfortunately, even we don't have a crystal ball. Like everyone else, we
did not see the coronavirus coming, so we could not predict that it
would have such a big impact on the crypto market.

In 2017 and early 2018, the price of ETH grew almost exponentially. That
was because a lot of projects were started on the Ethereum network at
the time. This was done through Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs). These
projects all had their own coin. As an [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/), you could participate
in these projects by sending them ETH. In exchange, you received these
new tokens. ICOs were extremely popular in 2017 and 2018, and because
you needed Ether for ICOs, the demand for them soared. Due to that
demand, the price rose to unprecedented heights.

The era of ICOs is over. Regulators have taken care of that. Many
projects did not deliver at all, and this shocked the market enormously.
Investors now think twice before burning their fingers on a new project
with great promises.

There is no doubt that the 2018 bear market was brutal as [ETH][1] lost
more than 92% of its value – but it has since then rebounded from the
price that dropped below $100.

The Ethereum [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) remains unquestionably the most robust smart
contract platform out there. Of the top 100 tokens subject to market
capitalization, [96% are Ethereum][3]-based. Of the 1,000 best tokens,
89% consist of Ethereum.

## Two Important Developments in 2021

Two major developments can push the course of Ether to new heights. The
first is the introduction of a new algorithm called proof-of-stake. The
second one is the development of DeFi.

### Ethereum 2.0

With the renewal of Bitcoin's historic high, all attention is riveted on
it: volumes and interest are growing, and new institutional [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s
are coming. However, crypto [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s with a long-term planning horizon
prefer Ethereum 2.0: the project already reached the TOP-30 in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of
capitalization.

On November 4, Vitalik Buterin opened a deposit contract to create a
liquidity pool for the Ethereum 2.0 network. At the moment, crypto
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s have reserved 1.7 million ETH.

The ETH 2.0 [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) upgrade is not currently presented on rating
resources since it will take several years before the network is fully
deployed. Validators reserve funds in blocks of 32 ETH to participate in
staking. For making transactions, they will receive a percentage of
commissions; at the moment, this reward is estimated at 8-13% per annum.
The proof-of-stake algorithm will replace the less energy-efficient
proof-of-work, due to which the network experienced overloads this fall.
And [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s will receive new coins in exchange for old Ethereum in a
1: 1 ratio. A reverse transition is not possible.

At the end of this year, Bitcoin grew by 233%; during the same time,
Ethereum soared by 404%. Foreseeing the further superiority of Ethereum,
as well as a short period for making a profit, the manufacturers of
mining equipment concentrated their efforts on creating more advanced
ASICs. The network hashrate will soon update its [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) maximum.

Ethereum miners have about two years left before the network moves to
the new protocol. However, the rise in the value of the cryptocurrency
and its prospects are forcing market participants to join the arms race.
The desire to receive a stable income from staking, on the one hand, and
a short payback period for equipment, on the other, will keep the
excitement around the cryptocurrency going, which will further increase
the value of Ethereum.

### DeFi

A very important development in recent times is the growth of DeFi. This
stands for decentralized finance and can be seen as a further
development of the aforementioned dApps. DeFi companies are service
providers that provide loan services on the Ethereum [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/), for
example, where only a [smart contract](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/smart-contract-on-blockchain/) is required for the export.

Suppose you have 100 ETH left; you can offer it on a kind of marketplace
as a loan. Someone else can agree to this; the conditions are poured
into a [smart contract](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/smart-contract-on-blockchain/), and the borrower offers collateral. Nothing more
is needed.

Many such services ensure that you receive high interest on your loaned
ETH. And by high, we mean interest that our parents talk nostalgically
about.

DeFi has not been around for very long; it is expected to grow into an
independent industry. Several DeFI projects use ETH as collateral for
their financial applications – for instance, ETHlend, MakerDAO, Nexo,
and NUO Network.

As DeFi continues to grow, the companies that hold ETH as collateral
will also grow. So, it’s a great idea to keep an eye on Ethereum
updates!

## The Introduction of Sharding

"Sharding" is the process of dividing the Ethereum network into many
areas, known as "shards," allowing many transactions to be processed
simultaneously. Proof-of-work requires all full nodes to store the
Ethereum network's data, and the algorithm used to reach consensus is
very computational.

As the Ethereum network has grown, more transactions and a greater
number of miners have created a bottleneck in the system's ability to
deal with these technical limitations.

Sharding is one way of addressing this problem by distributing data and
transaction processing [functions](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/basic-functions/) among different nodes within the
network. All nodes no longer need to store all data and process all
transactions. Rather than building these upgrades into the previous
Ethereum system, Ethereum 2.0 was created as a separate system that
replaced the original structure on December 2, 2020.

Suppose the changes implemented by Ethereum 2.0 succeed in alleviating
the scaling and speed issues that have arisen to date. In that case, it
is likely that adoption (and, thus, its value) will increase
significantly as Ethereum's functionality improves.

## Ethereum in 2021

ETH, like the rest of the market, is at the center of Bitcoin's price
action. So, when Bitcoin starts a bull run, ETH can also hope for it.

With the pandemic outbreak, the world hibernated for a few months, and
it negatively impacted cryptocurrencies, causing Bitcoin to go downhill
as we recorded even 40% [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) losses. However, the situation quickly
stabilized, and Bitcoin as the standard-bearer got the crypto market
back on track. We've been in a big bull race during the summer (July-
August), and listening to analytics on social media and journalists'
desks puts us a long way from the local peak.

As long as Bitcoin is in the lead and moves up, ETH will usually do the
same. ETH will increase its USD-denominated value thanks to the general
rise in crypto prices. The ratio between ETH and BTC is likely to
decline. Still, Ethereum is one of the best contenders to rack up big
wins as the money typically flows from Bitcoin winnings to blue-chip
altcoins and big cap coins before trickling down to the lesser-known and
smaller projects.

Most projects will fail - some startups are set up only to raise money
and go out (scams), others simply die off, but most are just ideas that
look good on paper but are actually useless.

As a result, more than 95% of successful ICOs and cryptocurrency
projects will fail, and their [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s will lose money. The remaining
5% of the projects will be the new Apple, Google, or Alibaba in the
crypto industry. Will ETH be part of this 5%? It’s very likely.

Ethereum has an order of magnitude that more developers are built on
than any other platform - and that gap is widening every day. That means
that if another [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) platform wants to beat Ethereum in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of
developer adoption, it won't be enough to match Ethereum's level - it
must surpass Ethereum's growth rate in the future. If you don't have
developers building applications on your [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/), you are essentially
creating a ghost town.

The [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) platform, on which most developers develop real-world
applications, will be the platform with the widest mainstream adoption.
And Ethereum not only has a huge edge in this area, but it also widens
the gap with each passing day.

## What Experts Predict

Ethereum supporters were excited about the upcoming launch of Ethereum
derivatives on the CME. Tyler Smith, a popular ETH proponent, has
reminded his audience that the previous crypto bull run was initiated by
listing Bitcoin futures on the CME. He [believes][4] the launch of
Ethereum derivatives could have a similar outcome on the [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/)
ecosystem.

Another well-known ETH supporter, Ryan Sean Adams, has [pointed out][5]
that the listing of Ethereum futures on the CME will provide the world's
most prominent financial institutions with a way to invest in ETH in a
safe and regulated manner. Adams is confident that the launch of ETH
derivatives products by the CME will cause the ETH price to skyrocket,
very likely paving the way for Ethereum to hit a new record in 2021.

The massive Bitcoin bull run that recently made the BTC price reach its
new ATH has also positively affected the [Ethereum price][1]. After the
announcement of ETH 2.0 launch, the [Ethereum price][6] passed $625,
hitting its all-time high since 2018, and the most popular altcoin
continues to rise in value.

## Ethereum Technical Analysis

Early in the trading day on 12/29/2020, ETH/USD offset some of its gains
from last Thursday by declining to $710.53 – it is down by 2.58%
intraday, thus snapping a 5-day uptrend.

When we factor this into the bigger picture: even though overbought RSI
conditions led to the crypto’s pullback after a high that lasted 31
months, a 5-week ascending trend line and bullish MACD favor the bulls.
Regardless, ETH’s recent weakness sets $700 as imminent support.
Accordingly, ETH/USD bulls may choose to look for a fresh position near
$690 – but May 2018’s high of $830 might become their short-term,
overall target.

## The Future of ETH: 2023, 2025, 2030 Predictions

### Ethereum Price Prediction for 2023

With great brand exposure in one of the most sensible uses of the
[blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) dApps platform, ETH is optimally positioned to remain a top
cryptocurrency, right behind Bitcoin. With a potential Bitcoin-induced
bull run, it is possible to hit the previous all-time high of $1400.

### Ethereum Price Prediction for 2025

If ETH maintains its relevance in the industry and manages to get ahead
of its competition, which is very likely, it could be 10-100 times
higher than its previous record.

### Ethereum Price Prediction for 2030

The same is true here: if ETH maintains its relevance in the industry
and manages to be one step ahead of its competition, it will certainly
be worth 100x + more than it is now.

### Realistic Ethereum Prediction

Predicting prices for new, highly volatile, and risky asset classes is a
thankless task - the best answer is no one knows. The reasonable
assumption is that the realistic ETH price will be somewhere between the
current price and it's all-time high for the foreseeable future.

## ETH Historical Price Changes

We can’t simply make price predictions without looking back. Currently,
ETH is traded at $748.18. Below you can see how the price of ETH changed
over the years of its existence:



## Is Ethereum (ETH) a Good Investment?

Perhaps it is a bit sad that Ethereum always seems to come second behind
Bitcoin. Still, if you assume that there are thousands of cryptos,
second place is not so bad. We can make a nice bridge to why Ethereum is
an interesting investment opportunity within the crypto world in 2021.

Ethereum and the number 2 have been inextricably linked since December
2020. Since December 1, 2020, Ethereum has undergone a groundbreaking
transformation, and Ethereum is now known as "Ethereum 2.0".

In short, the main upgrade of Ethereum 2.0 over Ethereum 1.0 is in its
scalability. Ethereum 2.0 uses the technique of sharding for this. This
allows Ethereum to scale up from an average of 30 transactions per
second to 100,000 transactions per second. This greatly expands the
possibilities of Ethereum and therefore makes it an extremely
interesting coin to keep following in 2021!
