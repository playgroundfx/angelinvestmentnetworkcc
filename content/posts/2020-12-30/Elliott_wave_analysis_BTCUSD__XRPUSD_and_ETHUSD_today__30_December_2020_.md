Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 30.12.2020Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I suggest entry signals
to trade each cryptocurrency.

The Ripple market must have completed the corrective wave, so the price
should start declining in the impulse wave.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

 ****

The sideways corrective wave 4, which is a part of the bullish impulse
(5), is likely to have finished. Correction 4 is a contracting
horizontal triangle [a]-[b]-[c]-[d]-[e]. Therefore, the Bitcoin price
should be rising in impulse wave 5. The market could be running up to a
level of 29500.00. One could enter long trades in the current situation.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 27641.25 TP 29500.00

* * *

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

 ****

The market continues declining, so the previous layout is not relevant
any longer. The corrective wave [4] must have completed, and there is
developing the final impulse wave [5] that will conclude the entire
bearish impulse C. The first two sub-waves of the wave [5] have already
completed. Therefore, the price should continue declining in the sub-
waves (3)-(4)-(5) to a level of 0.062.

### Trading plan for **[XRPUSD][2]** today:

Sell 0.217, TP 0.062

* * *

## Elliott wave Ethereum analysis

 ****

The most recent chart section shows the price growth in the upward
impulse wave that is composed of the sub-waves [1]-[2]-[3]-[4]-[5].
There is now forming the middle part of this pattern, the sub-wave [3].
The first four legs of impulse [3] can have ended, and there is forming
the initial sub-wave of the final wave (5). The market should be rising
in wave (5) to a level of 790.00.

### Trading plan for  **[ETHUSD][3] **today:

Buy 736.81, TP 790.00
