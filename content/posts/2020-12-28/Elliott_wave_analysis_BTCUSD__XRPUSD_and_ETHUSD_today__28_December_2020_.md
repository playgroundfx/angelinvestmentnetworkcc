Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 28.12.2020Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I suggest entry signals
to trade each cryptocurrency.

Ripple is forming the upward corrective wave [4] as a double zigzag. The
final zigzag-shaped wave should be developing over the next few days.
Its approximate structure is outlined in the chart.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

 ****

The BTCUSD market is forming a large bullish impulse
(1)-(2)-(3)-(4)-(5). The hourly timeframe represents the final part of
this impulse, where correction (4) has finished, and the upward impulse
wave (5) is now forming. The first three legs of wave (5) must have
ended, and three is forming correction 4. Wave 4 should have a simple
zigzag structure and finish at a level of about 25000.00. After the
corrective wave finishes, the market should start rising in wave 5, as
it is outlined in the chart.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Sell 27149.50 TP 25000.00

* * *

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

There is forming a large down wave (W), which is the beginning of a
double global zigzag. Wave (W) is forming as a standard zigzag composed
of the three sub-waves A-B-C. The corrective wave B has recently
finished, and there is now unfolding the bearish impulse C. There should
be forming correction [4] as a double zigzag (W)-(X)-(Y). There should
be soon developing the final zigzag (Y), which could finish above the
final point of wave (W), at a level of about 0.386. Next, the price
should be declining in wave [5].

### Trading plan for **[XRPUSD][2]** today:

Buy 0.278, TP 0.386

* * *

## Elliott wave Ethereum analysis

The market continues forming a large bullish impulse. The bearish
corrective wave 4 must have ended as a triple zigzag
[w]-[x]-[y]-[x]-[z]. Therefore, there is forming the final impulse
composed of the sub-waves [1]-[2]-[3]-[4]-[5]. The first two legs of
this impulse have ended, and there is forming the impulse wave [3]. The
Ethereum price should be rising in wave [3] above level 750.00. One
could enter purchases under the current conditions.

### Trading plan for  **[ETHUSD][3] **today:

Buy 700.07, TP 750.00
