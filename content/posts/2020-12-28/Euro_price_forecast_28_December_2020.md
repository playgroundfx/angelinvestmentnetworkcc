Two scenarios to trade the euro. Forecast as of 28.12.2020Dmitri
Demidenko

Will the pandemic end in 2021? Who will control the U.S. Senate? The
answers to these questions will determine financial markets’ sentiment,
including the EURUSD. Let us discuss the Forex outlook and make up a
[EURUSD][1] trading plan.

## Fundamental euro forecast for a year

Place your new bets, ladies and gentlemen! The old ones have already
worked out! U.K. and EU reached a historic Brexit trade deal; Donald
Trump signed the $2.3 trillion COVID aid bill approved by Congress. The
uncertainty eased, which should have encouraged the EURUSD bulls.
However, the euro hasn’t yet continued the rally. Are the buyers still
celebrating Christmas, or is there another reason? The market can’t
exist without uncertainty. Investors are now concerned about other
problems. __ __

The reasons why Donald Trump changed his mind and signed the bill to
prevent government shutdown remain unknown. According to Reuters source
familiar with the matter, the US president was influenced by advisers
who saw no reason to refuse. Trump’s threat to block the bill made
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s worry and discouraged the[S&P 500][2] bulls. Therefore, after
the spending plan has been finally signed, the stock index should start
rising. However, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s could follow the principle ‘buy the rumor,
sell the [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/).’

One could see how the principle works on the Brexit example. According
to Boris Johnson, the deal with the EU ended the political uncertainty
in the UK, setting the UK economy on the way to recovery from the
pandemic. So, the political environment has improved, uncertainty has
eased, the pound should have continued rising, but it failed to
consolidate above $1.36, as [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s preferred to take profits.

Former bets have worked out. What's next? Investors now wonder if the
vaccines will defeat the COVID-19 pandemic and whether Joe Biden will
further expand the fiscal stimulus. The President-elect claims that the
$2.3 trillion aid package is just the beginning. If the money continues
flowing into the economy and financial markets, given the delayed effect
of the oil price growth, the financial world could face reflation, the
Fed’s interest rates could start rising, along with the bond market
rates, which will trigger mass sell-offs in the US stock market.

This scenario, first of all, depends on whether Democrats will control
the Senate, which will be announced in January. Otherwise, Republicans
will set back Joe Biden's plans.

### [EURUSD][1] trading plan for a year

Therefore, we could more or less anticipate the EURUSD trend only in the
middle of the winter. If there are new fiscal stimuli, reflation, and a
change in the Fed’s [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), the euro-dollar in the second half of 2021
could follow the pattern of 2017 and turn down after reaching the zone
of 1.25-1.27

Otherwise, if the Fed will hold the interest rates low, the euro could
reach the level of $1.3 in 2021. The euro's major growth driver will be
the victory over the pandemic, rapid recovery of the global economy and
international trade, and easing of the political and geopolitical risks.
