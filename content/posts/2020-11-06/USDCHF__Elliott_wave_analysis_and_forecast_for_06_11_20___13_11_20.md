USDCHF: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 06.11.20 - 13.11.20Alex
Geuta

 **Main scenario:** Consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 0.9209 with a target of 0.8900 – 0.8800.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
0.9209 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 0.9468 –
0.9620.

 **Analysis:** Presumably, the descending first wave of larger degree
(1) of 5 continues developing on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame, with wave 5 of
(1) forming inside. A local correction has finished developing in the
form of wave iv of 5 of (1) and wave v of 5 is forming on the H4 time
frame. The third wave of smaller degree (iii) of v appears to be
developing on the H1 time frame. If this assumption is correct, the pair
will continue to fall to 0.8900 – 0.8800. The level of 0.9209 is
critical in this scenario. Its breakout will allow the pair to continue
rising to the levels of 0.9468 – 0.9620.
