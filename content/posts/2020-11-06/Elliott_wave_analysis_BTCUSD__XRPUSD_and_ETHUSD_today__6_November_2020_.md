Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 06.11.2020Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I suggest entry signals
to trade each cryptocurrency.

Ripple and Ethereum are forming the final legs of the upward triple
zigzags. The cryptocurrency market should be rising up to the targets
indicated. Next, the prices could turn down and start new downtrends.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

 ****

The most recent section of the BTCUSD price chart displays the upward
linking wave [X], which is composed of the sub-waves (W)-(X)-(Y). There
is now forming the zigzag-shaped wave (Y), namely its final leg –
impulse C. The first four legs of the C impulse have completed, and the
market is now rising in wave [5]. The market should be rising to level
16700.00. An approximate trajectory of the Bitcoin future price
movement.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 15831.50, TP 16700.00

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

 ****

The XRPUSD market is forming the corrective wave B as a part of the down
zigzag of a higher degree. Wave B is unfolding as a triple zigzag. After
the second linking wave [X], composed of the sub-waves
(w)-(x)-(y)-(xx)-(z), finished, the initial part of the final wave [Z]
has started. Wave [Z] should be a simple zigzag, so the market should be
rising in impulse wave (c) to a level of 0.263, which is the previous
high.

### Trading plan for **[XRPUSD][2]** today:

Buy 0.249, TP 0.263

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

 ****

The ETHUSD market is forming a downward zigzag, with corrective wave B
forming inside as a double zigzag [W]-[X]-[Y]. The final leg of this
pattern is a triple zigzag (w)-(x)-(y)-(xx)-(z). After the down linking
wave (xx) finished as a triple zigzag of a smaller degree, the price has
started rising in wave (z). The zigzag-shaped wave (z) should soon end
at a level of around 437.00. Next, the new bear trend should start.

### Trading plan for  **[ETHUSD][3] **today:

Buy 428.53, TP 437.00
