EURUSD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 06.11.20 – 13.11.20Alex
Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions from corrections above the
level of 1.1602 with a target of 1.2019 – 1.2100.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
1.1602 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of 1.1526
– 1.1375.

 **Analysis:** Daily time frame: presumably, the first wave of larger
degree 1 of (3) continues developing, with wave iii of 1 formed inside.
On the H4 time frame, a local correction has formed as the fourth wave
iv of 1, and wave v of 1 started forming. Apparently, the first counter-
trend wave of smaller degree (i) of v is developing on the H1 time
frame. If this assumption is correct, the pair will continue to rise to
1.2019 – 1.2100. The level of 1.1602 is critical in this scenario. Its
breakout will allow the pair to continue falling to the levels of 1.1526
– 1.1375.
