USDCAD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 06.11.20 – 13.11.20Alex
Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 1.3385 with a target of 1.2800 – 1.2650.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
1.3385 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 1.3500 –
1.3633.

 **Analysis:** Daily time frame: wave (С) of 4 of larger degree
continues developing, with the first wave 1 of (C) formed inside.
Presumably, a local correction is completed as wave 2 of (C) on the H4
time frame. Apparently, the third wave 3 of (C) started developing on
the H1 time frame, with the first wave of smaller degree (i) of i of 3
forming inside. If the presumption is correct, the pair will continue to
drop to the levels of 1.2800 – 1.2650. The level of 1.3385 is critical
in this scenario as the breakout will enable the pair to continue rising
to the levels of 1.3500 – 1.3633.
