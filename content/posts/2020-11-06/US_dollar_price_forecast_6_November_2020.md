Dollar is following its heart. Forecast as of 06.11.2020Dmitri Demidenko

Investors are spending out the cash, which sends up the US stock indexes
and the EURUSD. Everyone is trying to join the S&P 500 uptrend. However,
the fundamental analysis suggests the euro should be weak. Let us
discuss the Forex outlook and make up a [EURUSD][1] trading plan.

## Weekly US dollar fundamental analysis

Markets are just like people. They follow their hearts from time to time
and forget about common sense. Investors like the idea of the division
in the Congress and the Democratic president. In this scenario, the
risks of tax hikes and high tech companies' strict [regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/) are much
lower. This fact supports the stock indexes. The [S&P 500][2] has been
up by 1% and more during four consecutive trading sessions, which has
been for the first time since 1982. In percentage [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/), those days have
been the best since early April. Markets consider Joe Biden to be a
better president than Donald Trump, which allowed the yuan to gain back
more than 50% of the losses faced during trade wars. The [EURUSD][1]
tested the resistance at 1.186-1.187.

The growing chance of Biden’s victory encourages [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s to spend the
cash, which they have been accumulating ahead of the US presidential
election. They are buying stocks and bonds. However, traders forget
about other factors, such as the pandemic, uncertainty around the new
fiscal stimulus, and Donald Trump’s willingness to reject the voting
results. It looks like an attempt to give out desirable for valid.
According to TD securities, there should not be any concerns about
challenging the voting results, which has pushed the risky assets up and
weakened the US dollar. DZ Bank believes that the greenback is falling
because the voting results were reported earlier than some had expected.
I do not think the above arguments to be strong.

I suppose traders are following their hearts. They invest the capitals
in the securities as they worry not to miss the uptrend, which sends the
[S&P 500][2] up, fuels global risk appetite, and weakens the US dollar
against a basket of currencies.

How long can it be going on? It depends. People in love are passionate
during different periods. However, common sense should win sooner or
later. The USA performs better than the euro area at the current stage
of the economic cycle. The Fed is not willing to boost the monetary
stimulus while the ECB tends to increase the current QE pace. According
to Bloomberg’s leading indicators, the largest euro-area economies face
a deeper drawdown in the PMIs because of the new lockdowns. The euro-
area bond yields fall, which signals that the markets expect the ECB to
take active measures in December.

### Weekly [EURUSD][1] trading plan

Let us be sensible during times of euphoria. Although the EURUSD has
rebounded from the resistance at 1.186, the [shorts][3] entered in the
zone seem vulnerable. It will be relevant to hold down the shorts if the
pair goes below the support at 1.179. The [S&P 500][2] rally could push
the euro up above $1.188. The [EURUSD][1] medium-term outlook depends on
whether the bulls can hold the price above 1.188.
