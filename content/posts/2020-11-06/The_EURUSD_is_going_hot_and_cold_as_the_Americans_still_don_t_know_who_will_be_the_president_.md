The market went crazy! Review as of 06.11.2020Dmitri Demidenko

The [EURUSD][1] is going hot and cold as the Americans still don't know
who will be the president.

## I haven't seen such sharp changes in financial assets' moves for a
long time

Markets' insanity is hell for analysts. Thus, the greenback weakened as
soon as Deutsche Bank gave up its bearish attitude to the USD index amid
enduring uncertainty caused by Trump's intention to appeal against the
results. As soon as [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s started selling the yuan and the
Australian dollar after the announcement of the intermediate voting
results, which suggested Trump may keep his presidential chair, those
currencies soared amid Joe Biden's growing advantage. Some are probably
tearing their hair out, but only those who do nothing regret nothing.

Look at the [EURUSD][1]'s weekly chart, and you'll see how difficult an
analyst's life can be. The pair has been changing its direction so often
that experts doubt that a trend is their friend. They aren't psychics,
right? It's psychics that can read other people's thoughts because they
don't have their own ones. Analysts got used to projecting trends and
regularities of the past onto the future, but the market appears to have
forgotten everything and ceased to follow the Republican. It's either
Biden who drives America to Alzheimer, or Trump who drives Biden to the
attorney.

As they say, an old ox makes a straight furrow. If it remembers what the
furrow is for. Investors may have a new hero soon. He may be not as
eccentric as his predecessor, not as fierce a Twitter fan as him. He may
not be going to label the Fed head as the US main enemy, but he still
has some charisma. Only the future will show if the Americans have
chosen the better of two evils.

What is more important is that financial markets are happy: the
Democrats in the White House and the House of Representatives combined
with the Republicans in the Senate are a good option for the [S&P
500][2]. A blue wave would harm the stock index with a supposed tax hike
and tougher [regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/) for tech companies. At the same time, the current
ball game will make it harder or even impossible for the new president's
initiatives to pass through Congress.

What is in store for us under Biden? He won't assert that he always
reaches the result, even if the result is negative, making [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s and
his administration feel awkward. On the other hand, the markets feel too
excited about the improvement of US-China relations. The Democrats have
always been tougher on China than the Republicans, and their leader
promised to punish Beijing for breaches. It won't be surprising if Biden
proceeds to "lynch" China for assumptions about the lab origins of
coronavirus COVID-19. The coronavirus has been undoubtedly created in a
lab: only an evil human genius could combine convulsive coughs with
diarrhea.

Life at Forex will probably be less funny and more dependent on the
president's twitter, but it will hardly be boring. In the meanwhile, the
vote count continues. The Americans haven't decided yet whose puppet
will be their president: China’s or Russia’s. They both look so
tempting!
