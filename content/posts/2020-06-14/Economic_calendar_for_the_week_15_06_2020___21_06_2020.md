Economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the week 15.06.2020 – 21.06.2020Jana Kane

## Overview of the main events of the Forex economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the
next trading week 15.06.2020 to 21.06.2020

 **Trading on key Forex [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/): we are expecting the publication of
important macro statistics from Canada, Germany, the US, Britain,
Australia, as well as the results of the meeting of the central banks of
Great Britain, Japan, and Switzerland.**

The US dollar rose last week, while global and US stock indices fell and
completely negated the growth of the previous week.

At the end of the trading day last Friday, the DXY dollar index futures
were trading around 97.35, 160 pips above the low reached on Wednesday.

Donald Trump criticized the Fed for gloomy forecasts made after the last
meeting of the central bank, and said that he expects a successful
second half. His statements were a response to the comments by Jerome
Powell, who last Wednesday made a forecast about the possibility of a
long-term economic recovery and problems in the labor market. Meanwhile,
the Fed’s position proved to be an important support for the markets,
and the Fed indicated its readiness to provide additional support to the
economy and credit markets.

Still, evidence suggests that economic recovery after a pandemic will be
slow and uneven. There is a threat of a second wave of pandemic, which
may further cloud economic prospects.

Next week, the other three largest world central banks (the National
Bank of Switzerland, the Bank of Japan and the Bank of England) will
hold their meetings and make decisions on monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).

Investors will also pay attention to the publication of important macro
statistics from Canada, Germany, the US, Britain, and Australia.

 _ **Traders should pay attention to the following significant
macroeconomic data expected next week:**_

 *** during the coming week new events may be added to the [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) and
scheduled events may be canceled**

 ****** **GMT time**

###  **Monday, June 15**

No important macro statistics planned to be released.

###  **Tuesday, June 16**

###  **01:30 AUD Minutes of the June meeting of the Reserve Bank of
Australia**

This document is published two weeks after the meeting and the decision
on the interest rate. If the RBA positively assesses the state of the
labor market in the country, the GDP growth rate, and also shows a
hawkish attitude towards the inflation forecast in the economy, the
markets regard this as a higher probability of a rate increase at the
next meeting, which is a positive factor for the AUD. The bank’s soft
rhetoric regarding inflation above all puts pressure on the AUD.

At a meeting earlier this month, the central bank maintained its current
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) unchanged. The key interest rate of the RBA was kept at
a record low level of 0.25%, and the target level of yield on 3-year
government bonds was also left at 0.25%. The decision to lower the rate
and determine the current target level of government bond yield was made
at an unscheduled meeting of the RBA on March 19 in order to support
businesses and Australian citizens amid the rapid spread of the
coronavirus pandemic. The government was also forced to introduce a
social distancing regime, suspend enterprises and close borders for
international traffic.

Despite the relaxation of quarantine measures, some restrictions are
still in effect and adversely affecting the economy, especially the
services sector. In the 1st quarter, the Australian economy contracted,
and Treasury Secretary Josh Frydenberg officially announced the
recession that occurred in the country for the first time in 30 years.

After one of the bank’s last meetings, its head Philip Lowe promised
that “the board will not raise rates until there is progress in ensuring
full employment and there is confidence in stabilizing inflation in the
target range of 2-3%.” In his opinion, “there are no serious arguments
in favor of tightening monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) in the short term,” and “it will
be some time before interest rates are increased.”

Nevertheless, if the published minutes contain unexpected information
regarding issues of RBA monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), then the volatility in the AUD
quotes will increase.

###  **03:00 JPY Bank of Japan interest rate decision. Bank of Japan's
press conference and monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) comments**

The Bank of Japan will decide on the interest rate. Currently, the main
rate in Japan is in negative territory, amounting to -0.1%. Most likely,
the rate will remain the same. If it is cut and goes deeper into
negative territory, such a decision will cause a sharp decline in the
yen in the foreign exchange market and growth in the Japanese stock
market. In any case, during this period of time, a jump in volatility is
expected in the yen trading and on the Asian financial market.

At the end of May, during its extraordinary meeting, the Bank of Japan
left the deposit rate at -0.1%, and the target level of yield on 10-year
bonds at 0%, while maintaining the annual target level of [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/) purchases
at 12 trillion yen. The bank also introduced a new lending program worth
30 trillion yen, which will allow commercial banks to provide financing
to companies affected by the coronavirus pandemic.

Under this program, companies can receive loans without collateral and
at a zero interest rate. The goal of the program is to support
commercial companies whose bankruptcy rates have accelerated rapidly in
Japan over the past month, due to the coronavirus pandemic among other
things.

During the press conference, head of the Bank of Japan Haruhiko Kuroda
will give comments on the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the bank. The Bank of Japan
continues to adhere to its super-soft monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). As Kuroda has
repeatedly stated before, “it is appropriate for Japan to patiently
continue the current soft monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).” Markets usually react to
Kuroda's speeches. Surely, he will again touch upon the topic of
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) during his speech, which will cause increased volatility
not only in yen trading, but also throughout the Asian and world
financial markets.

If the bank's leaders decide that the Japanese economy is stable, and
the momentum of inflation to the target level of 2% does not decrease,
then they will refrain from changing the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).

###  **06:00 JPY Bank of Japan's press conference**

During the press conference, head of the Bank of Japan Haruhiko Kuroda
will give comments on the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the bank. Despite earlier
measures taken by the bank to stimulate the Japanese economy, inflation
remains low, production and consumption are falling, which negatively
affects export-oriented Japanese producers. Markets usually react to
Kuroda's speeches. If he touches on the topic of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) during
his speech, volatility will increase not only in yen trading, but also
throughout the Asian and world financial markets.

###  **06:00 GBP Report on the average wages of the British citizens
over the past 3 months. Unemployment rate**

On a monthly basis, the UK Office of National Statistics (ONS) publishes
an average wages report that includes the period for the last 3 months,
with and without bonuses.

This report is a key short-term indicator of the dynamics of changes in
the level of wages of employees in the UK. Wages growth is a positive
factor for the GBP, and a low value of the indicator is negative.
Forecast: the June report suggests that the average wages with bonuses
have grown over the last 3 months (February-April) by 1.3% (against
+2.4%, +2.8%, +3.1% , +2.9%, +3.2%, +3.2% in previous periods); without
bonuses - by 1.8% (against +2.7%, +2.9%, +3.1%, +3.2%, +3.4%, +3.5% in
previous periods). This is still positive data despite the fact that
they are below the average values. If the data are better than expected,
the pound is likely to strengthen in the foreign exchange market.

Also at this time, the office publishes data on unemployment in the UK.
Over the 3 months from February to April, unemployment is expected to be
at 4.5% (against 3.9%, 4.0%, 3.9% and 3.8% in previous periods). Since
2012, the unemployment rate in the UK has been steadily declining (from
8.0% in September 2012). This is a positive factor for the pound,
however, unemployment growth over the last reporting period is a
negative factor.

If the data from the UK labor market turn out to be worse than the
forecast and/or the previous value, the pound will be under pressure.

In any case, at the time of publication of data from the British labor
market, volatility is expected to increase in pound quotes and on the
London Stock Exchange.

###  **06:00 EUR Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices  (HICP) in Germany
(final release)**

This index is published by the EU Statistical Office and is calculated
on the basis of a statistical method agreed between all EU countries. It
is an indicator for assessing inflation used by the Governing Council of
the ECB to assess the level of price stability. A positive result
strengthens the EUR, a negative result weakens it.

In March, the HICP index (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) grew by +1.3%, and in April -
by +0.8%. The preliminary estimate for May was +0.5%. Final value for
May is +0.8%. The euro is unlikely to react very positively to the
publication of this indicator. If the data turn out to be better than
the forecast, then the euro may strengthen in the short term. The growth
is a positive factor for the euro. However, this is still not enough to
break the negative trend of the euro. Data suggests low inflationary
pressures in Germany.

###  **09:00 EUR ZEW Institute Business Sentiment Index in Germany**

This index reflects the difference between the share of optimistic and
pessimistic [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s, thus assessing the mood of [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s and
businesses. The growth of the indicator and its positive value indicate
an optimistic attitude of [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s, which is a bullish factor for the
EUR. Vice versa, a decrease in the indicator and its negative value is a
negative factor for the EUR. In February, the indicator value was 8.7
(against 26.7 in January, 10.7 in December), and in March - already
-49.5 (with a forecast of -23.4), although in April and May it
unexpectedly improved to 28.2 and 51.0, respectively. Forecast: the
value for June will be 60.0, which is likely to support the euro in the
short term. If the data turn out to be worse than the forecast and the
previous value, then the euro will decrease even more significantly.

###  **12:30 USD Retail Sales (Ex Autos). Retail Control Group**

This report (Core Retail Sales Ex Autos) reflects the total sales of
retailers of all sizes and types, with the exception of car dealerships.
Changes in retail sales are a major indicator of consumer spending. The
report is leading, and in the future the data can be strongly revised. A
high result strengthens the US dollar, a low one weakens it. A relative
decrease in the indicator may have a short-term negative impact on the
dollar, and an increase in the indicator will positively affect the USD.
Forecast for May: +5.1% (against -17.2% in April, -4.5% in March, -0.4%
in February).

Retail sales are a major consumer spending indicator in the United
States, showing changes in retail sales. The Retail Control Group
measure measures the volume of the entire retail industry and is used to
calculate price indices for most products. A strong result strengthens
the US dollar, and vice versa, a weak report weakens the dollar. A
slight increase in performance is unlikely to accelerate the growth of
the dollar. Data worse than the previous period (-15.3% in April, +1.7%
in March, 0.0% in January and February) will negatively affect the
dollar in the short term. Forecast for May: +4.0%.

###  **14:00 USD Speech by the Fed Chairman Jerome Powell**

Powell's comments may affect both short-term and long-term USD trading
if he again touches on the Fed's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). A more hawkish
position on the Fed’s monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) is seen as positive and
strengthens the US dollar, while a more cautious position is assessed as
negative for the USD.

If he makes unexpected statements, the volatility in trading in
financial markets may increase. Any hints about the need to maintain a
soft central bank [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) will cause a fall in the dollar and the growth
of the US stock markets.

Participants in the financial market will carefully study his speech in
order to catch signals regarding the Fed’s further actions.

###  **Wednesday, June 17**

###  **06:00 GBP Consumer Price Index. Core Consumer Price Index**

Consumer Price Index (CPI) reflects the dynamics of retail prices for a
group of goods and services that are part of the British consumer
basket. CPI is a key indicator of inflation. Its publication will cause
significant movement of the pound in the foreign exchange market, as
well as the London Stock Exchange Index FTSE100.

In the previous reporting month (in April), consumer inflation (in
annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) grew by 0.8%.

Forecast for May: +0.5% (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)). This value is unlikely to
provide significant support to the pound. An indicator below the
forecast may trigger the weakening of the pound, as low inflation will
force the Bank of England to maintain a soft monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).

Core Consumer Price Index (Core CPI) is published by the Office of
National Statistics and determines the change in prices of a selected
basket of goods and services (except food and energy) for a given
period. It is a key indicator for assessing inflation and changing
consumer preferences. A positive result strengthens the GBP, a negative
result weakens it.

In April, Core CPI (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) grew by +1.4%. It is likely that
the publication of the indicator will positively affect the pound if its
value is higher than the forecast and the previous value. Forecast for
May: +1.2% (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)). An indicator below the forecast and/or
previous values ​​can trigger the weakening of the pound.

###  **12:30 CAD Consumer Price Indices in Canada**

The Bank of Canada's Core Consumer Price Index (Core CPI) reflects the
dynamics of retail prices for a basket of goods and services (excluding
fruits, vegetables, gasoline, fuel oil, natural gas, mortgage interest,
long-distance transport, and tobacco products). The target inflation
rate for the Bank of Canada is in the range of 1-3%. The increase in CPI
is a harbinger of a rate increase and a positive factor for the CAD.
Core Consumer Price Index rose in March by +1.6% (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)), and
in April - by +1.2%. If the data for May is worse than the previous
values, then this will negatively affect the CAD. Data better than
expected and above the previous values ​​will strengthen the Canadian
dollar.

Forecast for May: Consumer Price Index will come out with a value of
-0.1% (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)), Core CPI with a value of +1.4%.

###  **21:45 NZD New Zealand GDP for the 1st quarter**

The release of this data will cause increased volatility in the NZD.
Despite the recent fall in commodity and agricultural prices (especially
for dairy products, which are the most important component of New
Zealand exports), and the coronavirus pandemic, which damaged the global
economy, it is likely that New Zealand's 1st quarter GDP report it will
come out with positive indicators so far, since it will reflect the
situation in the economy before the coronavirus. It is expected that GDP
growth in the 1st quarter of 2020 amounted to +0.5% (previous values
​​+0.5% and +0.7%) and +1.8% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) (previous value, for the
4th quarter of 2019, is also +1.8%), which is likely to positively
affect the positions of the New Zealand currency. If the data are better
than expected, the NZD will strengthen. Data worse than forecast and
previous values ​​may adversely affect the NZD.

###  **Thursday, June 18**

###  **01:30 AUD Employment rate. Unemployment rate**

Employment rate reflects a monthly change in the number of Australian
citizens employed. The growth of the indicator has a positive effect on
consumer spending, which stimulates economic growth. A high value is a
positive factor for the AUD, and a low value is negative. Forecast: in
May, the number of employed Australian citizens fell by 125,000 (after
rising in March by 5,900 and falling in April by 594,300).

Also at the same time, the Australian Bureau of Statistics will publish
a report on unemployment - an indicator that estimates the proportion of
unemployed to the total number of able-bodied citizens. The growth rate
indicates a weak labor market, which leads to a weakening of the
national economy. The decline is a positive factor for the AUD.
Forecast: unemployment in Australia in May was at the level of 7.0%
(against 6.2% in April, 5.2% in March, 5.1% in February). In general,
the indicators can be described as negative. However, in other large
economies, the labor market has deteriorated on an even larger scale due
to coronavirus.

The RBA leaders have repeatedly stated that in addition to the
international trade situation, the Australian economy and central bank
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) plans are influenced by the level of debts and household
expenses, the growth of workers' salaries, as well as the state of the
country's labor market.

In March 2020, the RB of Australia lowered its key interest rate by
0.50% to a new record low of 0.25% due to coronavirus, which was the 5th
rate cut in the last year. According to the RBA management, for the
growth of salaries and acceleration of inflation to the target range, an
unemployment rate of 4.5% or lower is required. Unemployment in the
country is not declining, and the return of inflation to the middle of
the target range of 2-3% is not even on a distant horizon.

The AUD is unlikely to respond positively to the publication of data
from the country's labor market. If the values ​​of the indicators turn
out to be worse than the forecast, then the Australian dollar may
decrease significantly in the short term. Data better than forecast will
strengthen AUD short-term.

###  **07:30 CHF The decision of the SNB on the interest rate. Monetary
Policy Statement**

The current deposit rate is in negative territory and amounts to -0.75%.
At the previous meeting in March, rates remained unchanged. The Swiss
National Bank has consistently advocated soft monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) in the
country, and the national currency has traditionally been considered
"overvalued." Recently, the franc has largely lost the status of a safe
haven currency, and the threat of intervention certainly restrains the
franc from excessive growth. According to the leaders of the SNB, the
franc is “still very overvalued,” and intervention in the foreign
exchange market remains “an important means of maintaining the low
attractiveness of investments in francs and easing upward pressure on
the currency.”

Traders will also carefully study the statement of the SNB to catch
signals regarding further plans concerning their monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). Tough
rhetoric of the statement will strengthen the franc. The soft tone and
the intention to continue the extra soft monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the SNB will
negatively affect the franc. High volatility is expected in the foreign
exchange market and, above all, in franc trading, if the management of
the SNB makes unexpected statements.

###  **08:00 CHF Press conference of the SNB**

After the publication of the decision on the rate, the press conference
of the Swiss National Bank will begin. During the press conference and
the speech by the Chairman of the SNB Thomas Jordan, the volatility of
the CHF trade is increasing, and traders are waiting for signals
regarding further plans for the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the SNB. Jordan’s
tough rhetoric will strengthen the franc. The soft tone of the speech
and the intention to continue the extra soft monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the SNB
will negatively affect the franc.

High volatility is expected in the foreign exchange market and, above
all, in franc trading if Thomas Jordan makes unexpected statements.

###  **11:00 GBP Bank of England's interest rate decision. Minutes of
the meeting of the Bank of England. Planned volume of asset purchases by
the Bank of England. Monetary Policy Report.**

In March (March 11 and March 19), during its extraordinary meetings, the
Bank of England cut its interest rate twice, bringing it to 0.1%, and
announced its intention to acquire British government bonds in the
amount of 200 billion British pounds, trying to counter economic damage
from a coronavirus pandemic. Management of the central bank announced
the expansion of its bond portfolio to 645 billion pounds from the
current volume of 445 billion pounds. “The current situation is
completely unprecedented,” said Andrew Bailey, the new Bank of England
manager, at a press conference after the extraordinary meeting on March
19. Bailey said he expects a sharp contraction in the economy due to the
coronavirus, and the Bank of England is ready to take further stimulus
measures if necessary. "No, we are not done acting," he said. Based on
these statements by Andrew Bailey, it is fair to expect further action
from the Bank of England towards easing its monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). It is
expected that at this meeting on June 18, the Bank of England will again
increase the volume of bond purchases to 745 billion pounds.

Also at this time, the minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of
the Bank of England are published with the votes cast for and against
the increase/decrease in the interest rate. The main risks for the UK
after Brexit are associated with expectations of a slowdown in the
country's economic growth, as well as with a large current account
deficit in the UK balance of payments.

The Bank of England Asset Purchase Program, also called Quantitative
Easing, has remained unchanged since August 2016 at £435 billion per
month. In March, the Bank of England's bond purchase volume on the open
market was increased to a new level of 645 billion pounds.

Intrigue over further the actions of the Bank of England continues. Both
in the pound trade and the FTSE100 index, a lot of trading opportunities
will be there during the publication of the bank's decision on rates.

Also at the same time, the Bank of England's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) report will
be published containing an assessment of economic prospects. At this
time, the volatility in pound quotes can rise sharply. One of the main
guidelines for the Bank of England regarding the prospects of monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) in the UK, in addition to GDP, is the level of inflation. If the
tone of the report is soft, then the British stock market will receive
support, and the pound will decline. Conversely, tough rhetoric of the
report in relation to containing inflation, implying an increase in the
interest rate in the UK, will lead to the strengthening of the pound.

###  **12:30 USD Initial jobless claims in the US over the past week**

The situation on the country's labor market is still deteriorating. Back
in February, the initial claims for unemployment benefits were within
its average values ​​of 193-252 thousand. However, then the situation
began to deteriorate sharply. Over the week of March 22-28, 6.9 million
claims were submitted, then 6.606 million claims, shocking observers and
market participants. A similar indicator published last Thursday (for
the week May 31 - June 06) came out with a value of 1.542 million
claims.

The US Department of Labor data published in early May showed an
increase in unemployment in the country to the level of 14.7%. In May,
the US unemployment rate was 13.3%. Economists attribute this to the
coronavirus, which has damaged the US economy. Many US companies
announced layoffs, and authorities ordered non-vital companies to close
their offices and stores in the wake of the coronavirus epidemic.
Current weekly growth rates of claims far exceed the previous record
level of 695,000 reached in October 1982. Then the number of initial
claims filed in four weeks was 2.7 million.

This indicator reflects the state of the labor market. An increase in
value negatively affects consumption and economic growth. Under normal
conditions, a high result weakens the US dollar, while a low one
strengthens it. However, under current conditions (the coronavirus
pandemic and a sharp economic slowdown), the reaction of market
participants to the publication of this report by the US Department of
Labor can be completely unpredictable.

###  **23:50 JPY Bank of Japan Monetary Policy Committee Meeting**

At this meeting, the Bank of Japan Monetary Policy Committee will once
again summarize the results of the bank’s next meeting at the beginning
of the week, analyze the economic situation in Japan and provide
guidance on possible future prospects for the Bank of Japan’s financial
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).

If the tone of the minutes of the meeting indicates the firm intentions
of the Bank of Japan regarding monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) in the country, this will
negatively affect the Japanese stock market and strengthen the yen.
Conversely, soft rhetoric regarding the prospects of the bank's monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) will contribute to the weakening of the yen and the growth of the
Japanese stock market.

###  **Friday, June 19**

###  **12:30 CAD Retail Sales Index**

Retail Sales Index is published monthly by Statistics Canada and
estimates total retail sales. The index is often considered an indicator
of consumer confidence and reflects the state of the retail sector in
the near future. Index growth is usually a positive factor for the CAD;
a decrease in the indicator will negatively affect the CAD. Previous
index value (for March): -10%. If the data for April is weaker than the
previous value, the CAD may drop sharply in the short term.

###  **17:00 USD Speech by the Fed Chairman Jerome Powell**

Powell's comments may affect both short-term and long-term USD trading
if he again touches on the Fed's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). A more hawkish
position on the Fed’s monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) is seen as positive and
strengthens the US dollar, while a more cautious position is assessed as
negative for the USD.

If he makes unexpected statements, the volatility in trading in
financial markets may increase. Any hints about the need to maintain a
soft central bank [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) will cause a fall in the dollar and the growth
of the US stock markets.

Participants in the financial market will carefully study his speech in
order to catch signals regarding the Fed’s further actions.
