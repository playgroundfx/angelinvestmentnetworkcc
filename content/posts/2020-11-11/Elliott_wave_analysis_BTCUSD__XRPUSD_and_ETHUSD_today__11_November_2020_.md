Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 11.11.2020Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I suggest entry signals
to trade each cryptocurrency.

The major cryptocurrencies have finished corrective waves and started
rising in bullish impulses. So, one could enter long trades on Bitcoin,
Ripple, and Ethereum.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

The BTCUSD continues forming the upward zigzag composed of the sub-waves
A-B-C. Wave A is not shown in the chart. Wave B is a contracting
horizontal triangle. After wave B ended, the market has started rising
in the new bullish impulse C that is composed of the sub-waves
[1]-[2]-[3]-[4]-[5]. The corrective wave (4) has completed as a
triangle, and the price could continue rising in wave (5) towards a
level of 16700.00. So, one could enter long positions under the current
conditions.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 15375.50, TP 16700.00

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

 ****

After the large bearish impulse (A) finished, the market has started
rising the (B) correction, wich is a zigzag A-B-C. Wave A of this zigzag
is a leading diagonal. Wave B is a triple zigzag, while the C wave is a
simple bullish impulse. The final leg of the [C] impulse has started, it
is wave [5]. Therefore, the market should be rising in this impulse
towards a level of 0.272. At this level, the entire correction (B) will
be 50% of the bear impulse (A). SO, one could enter purchases.

### Trading plan for **[XRPUSD][2]** today:

Buy 0.254, TP 0.272

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

 ****

The ETHUSD has finished the corrective wave B. Next, the market has
started rising in the new bullish impulse C, composed of the sub-waves
[1]-[2]-[3]-[4]-[5]. The first four legs of this impulse have completed.
Wave [4] is a triple zigzag. Impulse [5] is still developing. The
Ethereum price should be rising in the final part of impulse [5], which
is a short bullish trend (5), towards a level of 507.00. Therefore, it
is relevant to open long positions.

### Trading plan for  **[ETHUSD][3] **today:

Buy 458.21, TP 507.00
