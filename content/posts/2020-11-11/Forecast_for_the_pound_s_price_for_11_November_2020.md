Pound is a tough nut to crack. Forecast for GBPUSD as of
11.11.2020Dmitri Demidenko

[GBPUSD][1] bulls found some positive [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) under the heap of negative
information. The pair now has an excellent chance to continue its rally.
Let's discuss it and make a trading plan.

## Weekly fundamental forecast for pound sterling

My idea of buying the pound sterling at retracements with a target of
$1.34 looked questionable back in [October][2]. The [GBPUSD][1] was
fluctuating near the target of 1.3. Another wave of COVID-19 was gaining
momentum in Great Britain. London introduced new restrictions. Economic
indicators were getting worse. Investors were discussing the Bank of
England's [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) softening while political uncertainty around the US
elections supported the dollar. Thus, the necessary preconditions for
that idea of mine were Joe Biden's victory and a deal Brexit. The first
one has already happened, and the second one is about to come. If so,
the forecast for the pound may come true.

Undoubtedly, the [GBPUSD's][1] rally is mostly linked to the change of
the White House's tenant and positive [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) about the vaccine. It raised
the global risk appetite and put pressure on safe-haven assets. Still,
it's internal bullish factors that must have done their work for the
pound as other G10 currencies are falling against the USD.

At first sight, the pound was supposed to drown for several reasons:

  * Unemployment had risen to its 4-year peak at 4.8%.
  * Layoffs had grown to the top since 2009.
  * British QE extended by £150 billion.
  * The Bank of England forecasted a 2% GDP cut in Q4 amid the pandemic and new restrictions.

However, the face wind didn't knock the pound down, and the GBPUSD's
future looks optimistic.

Pound bulls found some positive [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) under the heap of negative
information. Even if the BoE expanded QE, it didn't hint at a REPO rate
cut. Now the markets expect the rate may be cut later than the projected
period of May-June 2021. Even if Great Britain introduces new
restrictions, the vaccine will support the countries that entered a more
severe lockdown, while the service sector will raise Great Britain’s
GDP. Even if the critical date of 15 November is very close and the
Brexit issue remains unsolved, there's some progress there.

It isn't even about Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak, who
followed Boris Johnson in saying that a deal could be made at the last
moment. It's about the British Parliament's cancellation of an Internal
Market Bill, which could allow London to unilaterally revise the
agreement with Brussels. What's more, not only Great Britain is
concerned. So is the USA. After Justin Trudeau, Boris Johnson was the
second person Joe Biden called after winning the US election. He had
said earlier Britain could say goodbye to a trade deal with the US if
the EU's agreement was violated.

### Weekly trading plan for [GBPUSD][1]

I think London and Brussels will find common ground. Together with the
US election results, it will allow my [forecast][2] of 1.34 for the
[GBPUSD][1] to come true. The pair will most likely rally (up to 1.4
according to Societe Generale), and the previous strategy of buying the
pound at retracements can remain up to date.
