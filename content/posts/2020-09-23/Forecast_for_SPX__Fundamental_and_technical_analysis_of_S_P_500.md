S&P 500 analysis and long-term forecast as of 22.09.2020Mikhail Hypov

The US stock market has been in the red zone lately, and I’m often
asked, what an eventual scenario for the S&P500’s development may be.
The question is quite appropriate, even more so because my latest
forecasts [here][1] and [here][2]  are no longer up to date.  At the end
of May and the beginning of June, it was hard to believe that stock
indexes could update their historic highs in the current crisis
situation. That contradicted technical and fundamental analysis and
common sense, in general. However, the market didn’t agree.

So, what is going on right now? Is common sense winning, or is it
another trap for bears? Let’s fund out.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Fundamental analysis

Disclaimer:  the information below may be considered as sensitive
content :)

The US macroeconomic indicators were terrifying already at the end of
May. The situation hasn’t improved since then. Pumping trillions of
dollars hasn’t helped out either.

According to Bank of America’s fund manager survey, most respondents are
still afraid of another coronavirus wave. Even information on the
vaccine isn’t helpful. Starting from 2020, COVID-related [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) has become
as important as fundamental macroeconomic multipliers.

Unfortunately, the number of new COVID deaths continues growing in the
USA, and the dynamics hasn’t plateaued out yet. What’s more, after
lockdowns were gradually lifted and borders reopened, the second wave is
100% likely to happen. In the first place, the markets worry about
governments’ reaction to the pandemic and not about the pandemic itself.
Many governments seem to be ready to re-establish the previous measures.
The rumour has it that Spain is ready to use the armed forces to fight
coronavirus in Madrid. In the south of France, open air activities have
been banned, while London has already [acknowledged ][3] that the second
wave started spreading. The markets are therefore beset with turbulence,
and panic sales are taking place.

At the same time, the US economy isn’t recovering.

The chart above shows that the number of “zombie” companies reached a
peak on the eve of the 2000 dotcom crisis. Zombies are companies where
profits are less than the interest paid on their debts for at least
three years. Basically, such companies make no profits and exist by
pumping a corporate debt bubble.

It seems that zombie companies will be multiplying, and crisis will only
aggravate.  According to FRED, US corporate profits dropped 24.3% and
may still drop by another 24.3%, if the situation is similar to the 2008
crisis.

Another important indicator is the loan approval/total request ratio.
This indicator has been down 40% since the beginning of this year,
approaching the 2013 figures. It means that the share of companies and
households that need crediting has increased dramatically. Many
companies are on the edge of bankruptcy, and this number goes on
growing.

The 2008 mortgage crisis situation was similar.

The US government must have learnt the lesson of the past well. The
relief package for the mortgage market has already exceeded the 2008
one. The chart above shows that the Fed has already purchased $178
billion in mortgage-backed securities.

According to surveys, the number of respondents who can’t afford to buy
a house came close to the 2008 figures (mortgage crisis) and 1982
figures (global economic crisis).

The JPMorgan analysts say that [S&P500][4] won’t update its highs unless
the index tests SMA200. However, given the big number of analogies with
the previous crises, this position looks too optimistic.  It’s rumored
that large funds are avoiding risks, selling out their assets.
Intelligent money is leaving the market, while the private [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) will
be left holding the baby.

The chart above shows that the number of small traders that joined the
bulls’ army is at its 2-year highest. Large hedge funds are shouting out
that bad times are coming, and the stock market will draw down deeper
soon. Nonetheless, the greedy crowd of hamsters is rushing to buy cheap
assets.

A full-scale sellout seems to have been triggered already. As the chart
above suggests, the S&P500’s latest growth was due to the printing press
only. However, the current situation makes me think that even the
printing press is useless. The relief measures need to be extended.
Trump doesn’t hurry to take a decision. His concern is clear: as soon as
he approves of another package which allows international companies to
make a buyback, he will face severe criticism. I hope it won’t happen
after the election, or else it might be too late. Let me remind you that
the US presidential election is taking place on 3 November. It means,
the market will stay short of money for over 1 month, and the risk of
seeing a new bottom increases.

## Technical analysis of S&P500

So, will the bottom be updated or not? Technical analysis will make the
situation clearer.

On the one-month time frame, the picture doesn’t look optimistic. The
[index reached][4] the trend line in the chart above. By analogy with
the year 2008, the prospects of fall are really frightening.  According
to that analogy and keeping its ratios, the scenario for the next
decades suggests a roller coaster experience.

Up to 2022, the market will be coping with the crisis by means of
liquidity inflows and printing press.  It won’t last forever, and the
index may fall to a level of 1,500-1,600 points.

The level coincides with the strongest support levels in the highest
market activity channel. A pullback is supposed to happen near that
channel in a perfect scenario.

You probably remember my [author’s approach][5] which implies comparing
an asset value with the 1971 Gold standard.  Based on that approach, we
can have a 2-cycle picture. The chart above shows, that the stock
market’s first peak formed in 2000. The market hasn’t fully recovered
after the dotcom crisis, and we are in the second cycle now. Its top
looks like Head and Shoulders. The other shoulder will be forming in
2022. Then the fall will cover the distance from Head to Neck. Thus, the
bottom is located at the 2011-2012 levels. These targets are
surprisingly close to the previous sencario’s targets, and thus confirm
it.

Bearing the global scenario in mind, let’s have a look at local charts.
Above, you can see Double Bollinger Band. The price moved to the narrow
band’s zone, and a bullish trend is therefore false. Speaking of a full-
scale sellout is too early yet, but JPMorgan may be right, and we may
see a consolidation with a pullback at 3,100 points in the medium term.
In addition to [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/)  SMA 200, it’s the yearly Pivot balance level and
the lower limit of the narrow Bollinger band. Stochastic [Momentum](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/momentum.html) Index
is located in the lower part of the chart. Located above zero, it
indicates a bullish market trend. Intersection of its moving averages
points to a bearish correction, while a divergence (red dotted line)
suggests a trend reversal. Given the private [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)’s bullish
sentiment, a new relief package will be adopted after November’s
election. It will allow the market to retrace. Double divergence, or
even the historic high’s breakout are possible, but Nero fiddled while
Rome burned too. And any show ends, sooner or later.

## Trading plan for SPX

The US stock market is famous for its bullish temper, and it has already
punished “short” traders many times. Holding short positions in [SPX
][4] in the current circumstances is risky. I would recommend calming
down. Locally, the S&P500 is in a bearish trend, and the target of 3,200
is appropriate. However, a breakout may occur at any time. I suggest
tracking these events. Lots of private [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are looking for a
signal to buy, and it’s hard to imagine a better moment for riding a
hamster bullish wave and trying to catch new maximums. I wouldn’t open a
long position before the index breaks out above the Bollinger narrow
band’s limits at 3,350.

## Final conclusion

Fundamental indicators and institutional [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are shouting that a
tsunami is somewhere near.  Only the ready ones will survive. The
riskiest players - private and small traders - will end up in the most
disadvantageous position, trying their luck at the last minute. The
problem is that intelligent money is focused on long [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/), while small
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s consider short time frames, if they make any considerations at
all. If you’re a beginner trader, I don’t recommend holding long
positions these days. You’d better try scalping or wait till the storm
ends. [Forex brokers][4] can do well with those tasks, offering big
leverage and moderate deposit requirements.
