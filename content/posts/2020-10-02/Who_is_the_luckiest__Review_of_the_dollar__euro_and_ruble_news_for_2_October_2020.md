Forex: who will be the lucky one? Review as of 02.10.2020Dmitri
Demidenko

There are things to reproach Donald Trump for, and his positions look
very vulnerable. However, in 2016, very few people bet on the
republican. Apart from that, one cannot say that the winner will be
lucky. He will take over a country with a fragile economy.

## Which currency will suffer the most from the change of power in the
United States?

The Market is like Democracy. It allows for different opinions. Some say
that the dollar will rise amid uncertainty ahead of the US presidential
election. Some, on the contrary, insist that the greenback will lose
ground because everything that is good for Donald Trump is good for the
American currency, and the ratings indicate that the current head of the
White House is losing to his opponent. Neither bulls nor bears have
confidence in their own righteousness. The Russian ruble is another
thing - it's hard to imagine an event after which it would not fall.

If you think that wisdom comes in old age, then just listen to the
Trump-Biden debate. The opponents interrupted each other many times, and
the word "clown" was the mildest insult you could hear. The republican
did not behave like a president but perhaps it was the only proper
tactic when your opponent has something to reproach you for. In the end,
you can always ask for forgiveness: I'm sorry that I'm talking when you
interrupt me!

Trump will go down in [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) as the first president since the end of
World War II to have had a net loss of jobs during his term in office.
The employment rate fell by 4.7 million, although in 2016 the republican
had promised to increase it by 25 million over the coming 10 years. The
White House has long forgotten about 3% GDP growth - the country has
plunged into the most serious recession in almost 90 years. Trump did
not improve the Balance of Trade, did not build a wall along the Mexico-
United States border. But there were also mistakes in managing the
pandemic, which cost the lives of 200,000 Americans. Trump has things to
blame him for, and Democrats are not dampening the stream of criticism.
They are not afraid of the formidable appearance of the owner of the
White House:

> \- Don't awaken the beast in me!

>

> \- I am not afraid of hamsters.

Until you tell a person who he is, you won't know who you are. The
latest debate can be called the new bottom of presidential politics and
the upper limit of national shame. The debate gave neither Democrats nor
Republicans an advantage, but Joe Biden retained his rating. The market
is beginning to talk about which currencies will suffer the most if he
wins, and the Russian ruble is mentioned most often. It is said that the
new sanctions would finally finish it off. The ruble is like a drunk man
after a party: if you let him go on his own, he immediately falls.

Well, other people's children grow the fastest. Especially if their
names are Dollar and Euro. The ruble can only hope that the [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) of
2016 will be repeated, when, in the same way, all the experts were sure
that Hillary Clinton would celebrate the victory. And then Donald Trump
won the election. The very same Trump about whom they said that having a
brain is an additional load on the spine.

So many men, so many minds. You can no more reliably predict the US
dollar rate on the eve of the election than you can predict the ruble's
rate after the election. It remains to be seen who will benefit and who
will lose from the change of government in the United States. Everything
might end very unexpectedly:

> -Tell me, fortune teller, which of the two men who love me will be
more fortunate, Joe or Donald?

>

> \- Donald, because you're going to marry Joe.
