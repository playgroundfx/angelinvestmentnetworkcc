GBPUSD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 02.10.20 – 09.10.20Alex
Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions from corrections above the
level of 1.2667 with a target in 1.3284 – 1.3485.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
1.2667 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of 1.2443
– 1.2200.

 **Analysis:** Presumably, the first wave of larger degree (1) continues
developing on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame, with wave 3 of (3) formed inside.
Apparently, a local correction formed as the fourth wave 4 of (3) on the
H4 time frame. Presumably, an ascending fifth wave 5 of (3) is starting
to develop on H1 time frame, with wave (i) of i of 5 formed inside. If
the presumption is correct, the pair may be expected to rise to the
levels of 1.3284 – 1.3485. The level of 1.2667 is critical in this
scenario, as the breakout will enable the pair to continue declining to
the levels of 1.2443 – 1.2200.
