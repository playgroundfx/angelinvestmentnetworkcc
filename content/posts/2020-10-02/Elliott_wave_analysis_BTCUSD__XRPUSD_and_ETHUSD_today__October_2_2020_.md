Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 02.10.2020Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I suggest entry signals
to trade each cryptocurrency.

The cryptocurrency pairs should not have finished forming the corrective
waves. Therefore, I have altered the previous scenario. The prices for
all the cryptocurrency pairs should be rising in a way displayed in the
charts. One could enter purchases in the current situation.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

 ****

The BTCUSD market must be forming the upward zigzag A-B-C. The bullish
impulse A has finished. There is now unfolding the bearish correction as
a double zigzag. When the first zigzag-shaped wave [W] finished within
this pattern, the price has started correction in the linking wave [X]
that is a double zigzag of a smaller degree. The price could be at the
end of wave (Y) which is a simple zigzag A-B-C. The sub-waves A and B
have ended, and the C wave is yet developing. Therefore, the market
should be going up to a level of 11315.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 10612.25, TP: 11315

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

The XRPUSD market continues forming the downtrend, which is a double
zigzag. When the upward linking wave (X) ended as a triple zigzag, there
has started a corrective pattern, which could complete as a simple
zigzag. The A impulse has completed, and the B correction is still
developing. The price should be rising to a level of 0.252.

### Trading plan for **[XRPUSD][2]** today:

Buy 0.237, TP 0.252

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

The ETHUSD market is forming the simple zigzag A-B-C. The sub-wave A is
a simple impulse, the corrective wave B is a triple upward zigzag. Next,
there has started a new downtrend developing as an impulse. Wave [1] has
completed, and the price is rising in the corrective wave [2]. Wave [2]
should complete as a zigzag (a)-(b)-(c), and the final impulse (c) will
end at a level of around 375.00.

### Trading plan  **[ETHUSD][3] **today:

Buy 351.06, TP 375.00
