Economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the week 29.06.2020 – 05.07.2020Jana Kane

##  **Overview of the main events of the Forex economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the
next trading week 29.06.2020 to 05.07.2020**

 **Trading on key Forex [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/): we are expecting the publication of
important macro statistics from Germany, the Eurozone, the US, Great
Britain, China, minutes of the June meeting of the Fed, as well as data
from the US labor market.**

Despite the growth observed on Wednesday and Thursday, the dollar ended
last week in negative territory. The DXY dollar index lost 0.3% over the
week. The dollar was not supported by a sharp increase in the number of
patients infected with coronavirus and a drop in the US stock indices,
which also ended the past week in negative territory.

Stock indices, in turn, were under pressure from the rising cases of
coronavirus in some states and the worsening of US-Chinese relations
after the US Senate passed a bipartisan bill last Thursday. It allows
sanctions to be imposed on Chinese officials who prevented Hong Kong's
limited autonomy from Beijing, as well as on banks and firms that do
business with them. Representatives of the Trump administration
expressed concern that this bill could impede diplomatic negotiations
between the countries.

Despite this, some [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s remain optimistic about the general lifting
of quarantine measures. Leading US indices have already gained more than
35% from March lows.

The stock market is supported by unprecedented stimulus measures by the
Fed, which has poured billions of cheap liquidity into the financial
system and keeps interest rates close to zero.

Oil quotes also dipped slightly over the past week. Investors take into
account the price of rising oil reserves and an increase in the number
of new cases of coronavirus in the United States. At the end of the
week, in just one day, the number of new cases of coronavirus in the
United States was almost 40,000. Almost half of the total number of new
cases occurred in four states — Texas, Florida, California, and Arizona.

The next week, which will be transitional between the first and second
half of the year, will not have much important macro statistics
releases. Nevertheless, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s will closely monitor the Fed Chairman
Jerome Powell’s speech in Congress on Tuesday, the publication
(Wednesday) of the minutes of the June Fed meeting and the data from the
US labor market, which will be published on Thursday, and not on Friday
as usual due to the celebration of Independence Day in the US at the end
of the week.

 _ **Traders should pay attention to the following significant
macroeconomic data expected next week:**_

 *** during the coming week new events may be added to the [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) and
scheduled events may be canceled**

 ****** **GMT time**

###  **Monday, June 29**

###  **12:00 EUR Harmonized Consumer Price Index (HICP) in Germany
(preliminary release)**

This index is published by the EU Statistical Office and is calculated
on the basis of a statistical method agreed between all EU countries. It
is an indicator for assessing inflation used by the Governing Council of
the ECB to assess the level of price stability. A positive result
strengthens the EUR, a negative result weakens it.

In January, the HICP index (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) grew by +1.6%, in February
by +1.7%, and in April by +0.8%. Preliminary forecast for June: +0.6%.
The euro is unlikely to react very positively to the publication of this
indicator. If the data turn out to be better than the forecast, then the
euro may strengthen in the short term. The growth rate is a positive
factor for the euro. However, this is still not enough to break the
negative trend of the euro. The data still suggests low inflationary
pressures in Germany. Data worse than the forecast and the previous
value will negatively affect the euro.

###  **Tuesday, June 30**

###  **06:00 GBP UK GDP for the 1st quarter (final release)**

GDP is considered an indicator of the general state of the British
economy. A growing trend in GDP is considered positive for the GBP. UK's
GDP was one of the highest in the world until 2016, when a Brexit
referendum was held. Then its growth slowed down, and with the onset of
the global coronavirus pandemic, the growth rate of British GDP
completely switched to negative territory.

The forecast expects UK annual GDP  to have decreased by -2% in the 1st
quarter of 2020 (after zero in the 4th quarter of 2019). This is a
negative factor for the GBP.

The main factors that could force the Bank of England to keep rates low
are weak GDP and labor market growth, as well as low consumer spending.
If GDP data are weaker than expected, this will put even more downward
pressure on the pound. A strong GDP report will strengthen the pound.

###  **09:00 EUR Consumer Price Index. Core Consumer Price Index
(preliminary release)**

The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is published by Eurostat and determines
the price change of a selected basket of goods and services for a given
period. The index is a key indicator for measuring inflation and
changing consumer preferences. A positive result strengthens the EUR, a
negative result weakens it. In January, the CPI increased by 1.4% (in
annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)), in February - by +1.2%, in March - by +0.7%, in April -
by +0.3%, and in May by +0.1%, which indicates a low inflationary
pressure and even a slowdown in inflation. Forecast for June: +0.1% (in
annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)). The expected data are below the previous values, which is
already negative for the euro. If they turn out to be worse than the
forecast, then the euro may sharply decline in the short term. The data
better than the forecast and / or the previous value can strengthen the
euro in the short term, despite the low value (the target level of
consumer inflation of the ECB is slightly below 2.0%).

Core Consumer Price Index (Core CPI) determines the change in prices of
a selected basket of goods and services for a given period and is a key
indicator for assessing inflation and changing consumer preferences.
Food and energy are excluded from this indicator to get a more accurate
estimate. A high result strengthens the EUR and a low result weakens it.
In January, Core CPI increased by 1.1% (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)), in February -
by +1.2%, in March - by +1.0%, in April and May - by +0.9%. If the data
for June is worse than the previous value or forecast, this could
negatively affect the euro. If the data turn out to be better than the
forecast or the previous value, then the euro will most likely react
with the growth of quotations, but only in the short term. Eurozone
inflation remains low, which is a negative factor for the euro. Forecast
for June: +0.8%.

###  **After 14:00 USD Speech by the head of the Fed Jerome Powell**

Powell's comments may affect both short-term and long-term USD trading
if he again touches on the Fed's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). A more hawkish
position on the Fed’s monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) is seen as positive and
strengthens the US dollar, while a more cautious position is assessed as
negative for the USD.

If he makes unexpected statements, volatility in the financial markets
may increase. Any hints about the need to maintain a soft central bank
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) will cause a fall in the dollar and the growth of US stock
markets.

Participants in the financial market will carefully study his speech in
order to catch signals regarding the Fed’s further actions.

###  **After 14:00 USD Speech by the US Treasury Secretary Stephen
Mnuchin**

As head of the Department of the Treasury, Stephen Mnuchin oversees the
implementation of US economic and monetary policies aimed at economic
growth, job creation and internal stability. His comments often cause a
surge in volatility in the US stock markets, as well as in the dollar
quotes.

###  **Wednesday, July 1**

###  **01:45 CNY Caixin Manufacturing Activity Index (PMI)**

This is a leading indicator of the state of the manufacturing sector in
China. The Chinese economy is the second largest in the world, so the
publication of important macroeconomic indicators from China can have a
strong impact on the entire financial market. Forecast: 50.5 in June
(against 50.7 in May, 49.4 in April, 50.1 in March).

The data indicate a decline in activity in this important sector of the
Chinese economy, which is probably also associated with the consequences
of coronavirus in this country. A value below 50 indicates a slowdown. A
value below the forecast may have an even greater negative impact on the
yuan.

An increase in the indicator and a value above 50 are a positive factor
for the yuan. If the data turn out to be better than the forecast and
above the value of 50, then the yuan will strengthen against the dollar,
which is likely to also positively affect commodity currency quotes,
such as, for example, New Zealand and Australian dollars.

###  **07:55 EUR Unemployment rate in Germany. Change in the number of
unemployed**

German Federal Statistical Office will publish data on the country's
labor market for June. Since May 2019, the country's unemployment rate
remained unchanged at 5%. However, in April this indicator rose to 5.8%,
and in May - to 6.3%. In the event of further growth in unemployment,
the euro will decline. If the data turn out to be better than the
previous value, the euro will strengthen. A decrease in unemployment is
a positive factor for the national economy and the country's currency,
and unemployment growth is a negative factor. Forecast for June: 6.6%.

Change in the number of unemployed. This indicator estimates the change
in the number of unemployed in Germany. The growth of the indicator is a
negative factor for the euro, and vice versa, a decrease in the
indicator will have a positive effect on the euro. In April, the number
of unemployed in Germany increased by 373,000, and in May - by 238,000.
Forecast for June: +120,000 unemployed.

###  **12:15** **USD ADP National Employment Report**

ADP Employment Report in the US in June. Usually, the publication of
this indicator has a strong impact on the market and dollar quotes.
Although there is usually no direct correlation with Non-Farm Payrolls,
the ADP report is considered a harbinger of the official report of the
US Department of Labor on the general state of the labor market in the
country. Employment is expected to have grown in June by 3.5 million the
number of workers in the US private sector (after a decrease by -2.76
million in May). The growth of the indicator has a positive effect on
the dollar. Deterioration of the indicator will have a negative impact
on the dollar.

###  **14:00 USD Employment Index (from ISM) in the manufacturing sector
of the US economy. PMI (from ISM) in the manufacturing sector of the US
economy**

Employment Index, an important indicator of economic conditions in the
United States, is published by the Institute for Supply Management (ISM)
and reflects business conditions in the US manufacturing sector, taking
into account expectations of future production volumes, new orders,
stocks, employment and supplies. The ISM manufacturing sector employment
index is considered an important leading indicator taken into account
when the US Department of Labor compiles the employment report. A high
value of the index strengthens the USD, and a low value weakens it. In
May, the value of the indicator was 32.1. Forecast for June: 35.0.

The index growth is a positive factor for yhe USD. However, the index is
much lower than the average annual values, and in the current conditions
of the coronavirus pandemic and quarantine, another decrease in the
index is possible, which will negatively affect the dollar.

PMI in the manufacturing sector of the US economy published by the
Institute for Supply Management (ISM) is an important indicator of the
state of the US economy as a whole. A result above 50 is seen as
positive and strengthens the USD, below 50 - as negative for the US
dollar. Forecast: 49.0 in June (against 43.1 in May, 41.5 in April, 49.1
in March, 50.1 in February). Relative growth of the index may support
the dollar. However, the index is still below 50, which could negatively
affect the dollar. Data below 50 indicates a slowdown in activity, which
negatively affects the quotes of the national currency. With the growth
of the indicator above the forecast and the value of 50, the dollar will
receive more tangible support and will probably strengthen.

###  **19:00 USD Minutes of the June meeting of the Federal Open Market
Committee (FOMC minutes)**

The publication of the minutes is extremely important for determining
the course of the current Fed [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) and the prospects for raising
interest rates in the United States. The volatility of trading in
financial markets during the publication of the minutes usually
increases, since they often contain either changes or clarifying details
regarding the outcome of the FOMC Fed meeting.

Following two meetings in March, the Fed sharply reduced its interest
rate (to 0.25% from 1.75% in February), and also announced the
allocation of $700 billion for the purchase of US government bonds and
mortgage-backed securities. Subsequently, the Fed has repeatedly
announced additional measures to support the US economy and inject cheap
liquidity into the financial system.

In an online session hosted by the Peterson Institute for the World
Economy, the Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said that “in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of scale and
speed, this decline has no precedent in modern [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) and is much worse
than any recession since World War II,” adding that the Fed did not
consider negative interest rates.

The soft tone of the protocol will have a positive effect on stock
indices and negatively on the US dollar. The tough rhetoric of Fed
leaders regarding monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) prospects will push the dollar toward
further growth.

A statement following the Fed meeting on the open market operations
committee on June 10 said that the “coronavirus pandemic will put strong
pressure on economic growth, inflation, employment in the short term and
will pose significant risks for the economy in the medium term. In the
coming months, the Fed will increase its portfolio (treasury and
mortgage bonds) at least at the current pace to ensure smooth
functioning of the market."

The US Federal Reserve also confirmed that it does not plan to raise
interest rates until the end of 2022.

###  **Thursday, July 2**

###  **12:30 USD Average hourly wages. Non-Farm Payrolls. Unemployment
rate**

These are the most important indicators of the state of the labor market
in the US in June. Forecast: -0.6% (against -1.0% in May) / +3.0 million
(against +2.509 million in May and -20.687 million in April) / 12.2%
(against 13.3% in May and 14.7% in April), respectively.

In general, the indicators can be described as disappointing but quite
understandable due to massive layoffs in American companies and the
closure of offices and shops due to the coronavirus. At the same time,
the data indicate a gradual improvement in the US labor market after its
landslide in previous months at the beginning of the year. Prior to
coronavirus, the US labor market remained strong, indicating the
stability of the US economy and supporting dollar quotes.

Predicting market reactions to the publication of indicators is often
difficult, because many indicators for previous periods may be revised.
Now it will be even more difficult to do this, as the economic situation
in many other large economies is no better. In any case, during the
publication of data from the US labor market, a surge in volatility is
expected in trading not only in the USD, but throughout the financial
market. The most cautious [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s might prefer to stay out of the
market during this period of time.

###  **Friday, July 3**

Independence Day is celebrated in the US; banks and exchanges in the
country are closed. Therefore, trading volumes during the US trading
session will be low.

Also no publication of important macro statistics is planned.
