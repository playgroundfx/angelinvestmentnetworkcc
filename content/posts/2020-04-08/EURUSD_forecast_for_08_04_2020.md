Dollar shut off the lightsDmitri Demidenko

## It is not easy to re-open the U.S. economy. It is not the same as to
switch on the light that was shut off earlier

Back to the Future. The characters of a popular film go back to the past
to change the future. The world financial crisis of 2008-2009 is now
referred to in an attempt to suggest future scenarios and investment
strategies for different assets. Although the nature of the previous
recession is completely different, and the coronavirus outbreak is more
like a natural disaster that is usually followed by a quick economic
recovery, there are more and more supporters of the U-shaped recovery of
the U.S. growth. However, there are more and more traders willing to
sell the dollar.

The S&P 500 growth by 19% up from the March low suggests that the huge
monetary and fiscal stimulus provided by the Fed and the U.S. government
reassured financial markets. Nonetheless, the stock index is more than
20% lower than its all-time high hit in February. On April 7, the S&P
500 turned down, and the opinion that professionals enter the market at
the end of a trade session increases the chance that the fall will
continue. The U.S. stock market is still shaky. The bulls may be scared
by the [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) that the epidemiological situation is getting worse, by the
announcement that the U.S. government is not able to transfer the
financial stimulus to businesses quickly enough, or the unwillingness of
the OPEC+ to cut oil production in the necessary volume.

The S&P 500 drop could press the [EUR/USD][1] down. The pair’s
volatility has increased much in 2020. Besides the costs of short-term
hedging against currency risks are lower than those for long-term
hedging. Investors believe that the monetary stimuli provided by the Fed
and the ECB are bearing some fruit but they are still concerned about
the future.

 **EUR/USD volatility**

Although the U.S. President’s top economic adviser Larry Kudlow claims
that the U.S. economy is able to return to work at full capacity in the
next four to eight weeks, the former Fed chair Ben Bernanke sees a bad
year ahead. The U.S. economy could shrink 30% or more in the second
quarter, and it could be a couple of years before the economy regains
its footing. It is not easy to remove the coronavirus. They can’t shut
off the epidemic. Even after a sharp decrease in the number of new cases
and deaths, it is necessary to implement testing and monitoring programs
and to maintaining social distance, although on a smaller scale than at
present. It is necessary to reassure companies and people that they can
return to work without the risk of infection.

Besides, there might be the second wave of the epidemic in Autumn, which
suggests that the increased volatility in the financial markets will
continue. Therefore, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s hold the US dollar and other safe-haven
assets in their portfolios.

I see a high chance of the medium-term consolidation of the S&P 500 and
the [EUR/USD][1]. Bulls are encouraged by the hope for a soon victory
over the epidemic and by the willingness of the White House and the
Congress to boost fiscal stimulus if it is necessary. Bears, on the
contrary, expect bad [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/), including a sharp aggravation of the US
domestic data.
