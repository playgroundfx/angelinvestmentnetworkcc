There is developing a long-term impulse wave A that is composed of five
sub-waves. The long corrective wave [4] has completed as a triple
zigzag. The market has just started unfolding the final wave [5].
Therefore, the price should be declining to a level below 3777 in the
next few weeks. This is the previous low made by the bear impulse 3.

The corrective wave [4] is likely to have completed as a triple zigzag.
Its final leg, wave c of (z), is an ending diagonal. The market is now
following an inceptive segment of the down wave [5] that may complete as
an impulse. Therefore, the price should be declining in this wave in the
next few weeks.

The above chart displays the structure of the down impulse wave (C) that
consists of the sub-waves [1]-[2]-[3]-[4]-[5]. After the long-term
corrective wave [4] completed as a triple zigzag (w)-(x)-(y)-(x)-(z),
the market has started declining. There should be forming the final bear
impulse wave [5]; as it has just started, the XRPUSD should be moving
down in the next few weeks.
