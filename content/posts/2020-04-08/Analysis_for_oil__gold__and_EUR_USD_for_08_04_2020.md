Analysis for oil, gold, and EUR/USD for 08.04.2020Alex Rodiоnov

###  **USCrude – oil**

Oil middle-term uptrend continues. Buy target in the trend is Target
Zone 2 [30.75 – 30.19]. The trend key support is now at [23.29 - 22.73].
Expect the price to enter the zone of good buy prices and look for a
pattern to open long position.

The short-term chart indicates that the oil local trend has reversed
down, as Intermediary Zone [26.09 – 25.81] was broken out downside
yesterday. The price has almost reached Target Zone [23.29 – 22.73], and
it is now being corrected up.

There are strong resistances to the correction:

  1. Additional Zone [25.11 - 24.95].

  2. Intermediary Zone [26.86 - 26.54].

After the above zones are tested, one might enter sell trades according
to the pattern with the target to break through yesterday’s low. After
Target Zone is reached, I suggest switching to looking for entry points
for middle-term positions.

###  **XAUUSD –** **gold** ****

Nothing has changed in the gold medium-term price chart since yesterday.
The uptrend continues, the target is Target Zone 4 [1697.2 – 1691.2].
Look for buy entries.

The short-term gold trend is up.

The price is now trading between the strong resistance Target Zone
[1660.1 - 1651.8] and the trend key support [1631.4 – 1627.2]. After the
price reaches the trend key support, I suggest looking for buy entries
according to the patterns. The target will be around yesterday’s high.

To sell gold, traders should break Intermediary Zone downside and
consolidate the price below. In this case, the target will be the lower
Target Zone [1589.7 — 1581.3].

 **[XAUUSD][6] Trading ideas for today:**

Buy according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone [1631.4 - 1627.2].
TakeProfit: 1672.0. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

###  **EURUSD – euro/dollar**

The EUR/USD was being corrected up and getting close to Target Zone
[1.0957 – 1.0940] yesterday. However, the price didn’t test the zone.
The price is now declining. To sell the euro at good prices, I recommend
expecting the test of the key resistance of the trend.

![LiteForex: Analysis for oil, gold, and EUR/USD for 08.04.2020][7]

The EUR/USD short-term trend reversed up yesterday, the price broke out
Intermediary Zone [1.0863 – 1.0854] and consolidated above.

The price is now being corrected down and testing the trend key support
[1.0839 - 1.0830]. Expect the pattern in this zone to buy the eurusd
with a target at Target Zone [1.0957 – 1.0940].

Alternative scenario is IZ breakout. In this case, it will be relevant
to sell the euro with a take profit at the lower Target Zone [1.0753 —
1.0736].

 **[EURUSD][9] Trading ideas for today: **

  1. Buy according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone [1.0839 - 1.0830]. TakeProfit: Target Zone [1.0957 - 1.0940]. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. If Intermediary Zone [1.0839 - 1.0830] is broken out, sell. TakeProfit: Target Zone [1.0753 - 1.0736]. StopLoss: above the next local high.

> IZ - Intermediary Zone: responsible for the price momentum reversing

>

> TZ - Target Zone: a zone that is 75% likely to be reached after IZ
breakout.

>

> GZ - Gold Zone: zone in the medium-term momentum.

>

> All zones are calculated based on the average [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) price of the
instrument and margin requirements of the futures.
