USDJPY: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 20.11.2020 -
27.11.2020Alex Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 105.66 with a target of 102.50 – 101.11.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
105.66 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 106.39 –
107.36.

 **Analysis:** Daily time frame: presumably, a correction of larger
degree is completed in the form of wave (B). Wave (С) has started to
form, with the third wave 3 of (C) developing inside. H4 time frame: the
first wave of smaller degree (i) of iii of 3 formed and an ascending
correction is completed in the form of wave (ii) of iii of 3.
Apparently, wave (iii) of iii is developing on the H1 time frame. If
this assumption is correct, the pair will continue to fall to 102.50 –
101.11. The level of 105.66 is critical in this scenario as the breakout
will enable the pair to continue growing to the levels of 106.39 –
107.36.
