USDCAD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 20.11.2020 –
27.11.2020Alex Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 1.3173 with a target of 1.2800 – 1.2650.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
1.3173 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 1.3384 –
1.3500.

 **Analysis:** Daily time frame: wave (С) of 4 of larger degree
continues developing, with the first wave 1 of (C) formed inside.
Presumably, a local correction is completed as wave 2 of (C) on the H4
time frame. H1 time frame: apparently, the third wave 3 of (C) is
forming here, with the first wave of smaller degree i of 3 formed and an
ascending correction presumably completed as wave ii of 3 inside. If the
presumption is correct, the pair will continue to fall in wave iii of 3
to the levels of 1.2800 – 1.2650. The level of 1.3173 is critical in
this scenario, as the breakout will enable the pair to continue rising
to the levels of 1.3384 – 1.3500
