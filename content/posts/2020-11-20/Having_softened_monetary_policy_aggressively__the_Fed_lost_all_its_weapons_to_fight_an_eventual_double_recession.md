Central banks went too far. Review as of 20.11.2020Dmitri Demidenko

Having softened monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) aggressively, the Fed lost all its
weapons to fight an eventual double recession

## Fed Chair: a scapegoat for Trump, a man of his dreams for Biden

Can money solve any problems? The central banks can answer the question
the best. When you've got a hammer, any trouble becomes a nail.
Regulators' control over money is a crude tool, and it can be useless in
some cases. Never before have disproportions been as evident as now,
when stock markets are growing rapidly amid ultra-soft monetary policies
even if the pandemic has killed millions of people.

The IMF admits that financial markets are far from reality, and a
further rally will result in future perturbation and destabilization
when the bubble has burst out. Saying monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) is just all right,
the Fed officials admit that they went too far, though. If the economy
may face a double recession, it's better to do something to avoid it. At
the same time, if everything is "all right" and the federal funds rate
and QE are optimal, the previous steps have been too aggressive.
Finally, it's Donald Trump, who wins. The man always learns from the
mistakes of those who have followed his advice. He asked the Fed to cut
borrowing costs and revive QE a while ago. Now, face the music.

It's sometimes only after a breakup that you get to know a person for
real. As President, Trump worried about the US economy and supported the
idea of monetary and fiscal stimuli. He criticized the Fed for not
softening monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) and praised it for rate cuts and emergency
loan programs. Now that Trump has to leave the White House, he's putting
a spoke in Biden's wheel through Steven Mnuchin, saying that cheap
credits have already played their role and that it's time to phase out
those programs.

What's more, the 45th President continues to raise market uncertainty,
questioning Biden's victory and tweeting that "THEY WILL WIN".

> \- It's Trump. He's complaining about the US electoral system.

In contrast to the Republican, the Democrat is praising Jerome Powell.
Biden likes the way the Central Bank handles the dollar and the rates.
It will foster economic growth in the end. The contrast is obvious. What
would Trump have told Powell if he had been reelected?

> \- Love, our union is four years old! Let's celebrate and kill a lamb!

>

> \- And what does a lamp have to do with it?

The Chair of the Fed was a scapegoat under the 45th President, but now
he's a man of dreams. The funniest thing is a man of someone's dreams is
usually someone's ex-jerk.

Joe Biden inherited quite an interesting disposition: stock indexes are
growing amid a weak economy; the Fed understands it went too far; China
is waiting for a thaw, but it needs to be controlled strictly. Let's
wait and see how the Democrat will settle all those issues.
