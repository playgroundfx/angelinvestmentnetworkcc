Euro gave in to compliments. Forecast for 20.11.2020Dmitri Demidenko

When Citi, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and other large banks suggest
the EURUSD growth to at least 1.25 in 2020, it is difficult not to buy
the euro. Is it relevant to buy the EURUSD now? Let us discuss the Forex
outlook and make up a [EURUSD][1] trading plan.

##  **Fundamental euro forecast for today**

After me, the deluge. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he would
allow several emergency Federal Reserve lending programs to expire on
December 31. The Fed is disappointed with this decision that has a
political connotation. Donald Trump, leaving the White House, spares no
effort to hinder the new US president's reforms. The US central bank
would prefer that the full package of emergency programs created during
the pandemic continue to play its important role as a pillar of the U.S.
economy that is still fragile. The dispute between the US government and
the Fed, followed by the good [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) about the negotiations' resumption on
the fiscal stimulus, made the [EURUSD][1] ride a roller coaster.

Since March, the Fed has deployed thirteen credit lines to provide the
companies and municipalities with cheap money. The programs enabled the
central bank to pump trillions of dollars into financial markets by
purchasing corporate bonds and local government debt. The Treasury
allocated money to cover losses. However, twelve credit lines expire on
December 31, which creates another political conflict, puts pressure on
stocks, and supports the greenback as a safe-haven asset.

On the other hand, those who bet on the US dollar amid the US economy's
leading performance should be discouraged. According to Jerome Powell,
it is inappropriate to allow the completion of emergency lending
programs. The Fed will remove the lending programs at the right time,
but it won’t happen soon. Robert Kaplan, president of the Dallas Fed,
said he would not rule out the possibility that the economy slips back
into recession. Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester argues that the
US economy needs new financial support from the government. The same
idea is expressed by the IMF, warning that global GDP could stop
recovering without additional aid. Although global PMIs have increased
since July, there are signs that the process is losing momentum. The
crisis will leave dramatic economic fallout.

The International Monetary Fund notes that the rise in asset prices is
out of touch with reality. Investors do not consider the actual state of
the economy, which creates a potential threat to financial stability. I
have many times emphasized that the US stock market is overvalued. The
[S&P 500][2] drawdown will send the [EURUSD][1] down.

###  **[EURUSD][1] trading plan for today**

Investors are prone to believe in the euro bullish forecasts. They see
any positive [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) bit for the US stock indices as a reason to be the
euro. For example, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has agreed to
resume talks over a potential coronavirus relief bill on November 19.
Citi doesn’t rule out the USD drop by 20% in 2021; Goldman Sachs sees a
6% drawdown of the trade-weighted dollar; Morgan Stanley suggests the
[EURUSD][1] growth to 1.25. That is why [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are in a hurry to buy
the euro now. If the pair breaks out the resistance at 1.188-1.189, it
should continue the rally up to 1.192 and 1.1955. However, one should be
extremely careful when entering longs.
