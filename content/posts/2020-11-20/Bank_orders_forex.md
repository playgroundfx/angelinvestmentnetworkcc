Bank orders forexJana Kane

The forex market is decentralized. So how is it regulated and who
regulates it? The answer is – Banks. And they do so with **bank orders
forex**. The four major banks which participate in day-to-day forex
trading are Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan Chase, UBS, Citigroup and HSBC and
more than 50% of the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) trading volume is done through these banks.

Thus it is a case of common sense that these interbank and through bank
trades are those which determine the whole forex market. So for a
prosperous gain in **bank order forex** , you must understand as to how
forex is both guaranteed and unstabilized by banks.

 **What is interbank forex?**

This sector is where highest single volumes of [Forex trading](https://www.fintechee.com/forex-trading-strategies/) are done.
Banks engage in forex to balance their equity or their inventories
according to market status and market futures. They engage in a deal
with another bank, deals quite easily crossing the millions threshold to
offset their positions according to the market. There are two platforms
which interbank traders use, viz. – Reuters Dealing and EBS (Electronic
Brokerage Service).

 **Why is it important to a trader?**

To explain, let’s consider a situation wherein two banks participate in
a deal between USD/JPY. To offset each other’s’ positions as per the
market, they exchange the cash for a ratio which suits them both. The
impact of such a huge cash deal will quite obviously be felt in the
market with time. For a trader, a pre-disposed knowledge and awareness
to such deals can prove to be a huge gain.

 **Where do banks get the money for trading?**

The answer is quite simple, from its customers. The assets of a bank are
used by it for forex. But banks are also platforms where [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s give
forex trade orders. These orders are known as **bank orders forex**
where it is a bank who acts as the medium for [Forex trading](https://www.fintechee.com/forex-trading-strategies/). Investors
who prefer a bank as trading platforms instead of online trading
platforms often have a huge sum at their disposal, a sum which they deem
too large for open [Forex trading](https://www.fintechee.com/forex-trading-strategies/), ranging above $1million mark.

A **bank order forex** is a three-step process. Every bank has a
separate group known as its Foreign Exchange Sales and Trading
Department to deal with FX trading. And each group further has a
customer service desk or in official words a sales and trading desk
which answers to the interested customer. It is this sales desk which
takes an order from a customer, gets a requisite quote from a
representative trader and relays the same to the customer awaiting
his/her further decisions of regarding it.

 **Conclusion:**

To conclude upon the matter at hand, **bank orders forex** refers to
both intrabank orders and forex through banks. While the former is a
market where participants are only banks, the latter is where a bank
acts as a medium through which a forex trade is being made.

It is mentionable that when a bank oversees and runs a forex order, it
is the bank who acts as the participant in place of a customer. Thus for
any individual pondering on a **bank order forex** , it is advisable to
understand all that it refers and conjures before investing in it. And
do remember that
