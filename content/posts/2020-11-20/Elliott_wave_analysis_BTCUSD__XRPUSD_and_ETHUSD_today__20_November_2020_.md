Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 20.11.2020Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I suggest entry signals
to trade each cryptocurrency.

The three major cryptocurrency pairs are forming the upward zigzag, in
which final bullish impulses are forming. Let analyze each
cryptocurrency pair in detail.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

 ****

After the sideways corrective wave B finished as a triangle, the Bitcoin
price started rising in the C wave. Based on the internal structure, the
C wave is unfolding as a simple impulse. There is currently forming the
final wave [5] of C. Four out five parts have completed in wave [5], so
wave (5) should be developing and end soon. The market should be running
up to a level of 19200.00.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 17959.00, TP 19200.00

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

 ****

After the bullish impulse wave (A) ended, the market has started rising
in the corrective wave (B) that is composed if three primary sub-waves
A-B-C. Wave A is a leading diagonal, wave B is a triple down zigzag,
impulse wave C is still unfolding, with the final sub-wave [5]
developing inside. The final leg of wave [5] is forming now. The price
should be rising to a level of 0.310 in sub-wave 5.

### Trading plan for **[XRPUSD][2]** today:

Buy 0.302, TP 0.310

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

 ****

The chart displays the upward zigzag A-B-C, which is forming wave (Y) of
a larger degree. The sub-waves A and B have completed, and the C wave is
still forming. Wave C is composed of the sub-waves [1]-[2]-[3]-[4]-[5];
it is unfolding as an impulse. In early November, the bearish correction
[4] finished as a triple zigzag. Next, the market has started growing in
the final wave [5]. There should be unfolding the final wave 5 that will
conclude the entire bullish trend at a level of about 507.00.

### Trading plan for  **[ETHUSD][3] **today:

Buy 478.13, TP 507.00
