Franc is lagging behind. Forecast as of 29.06.2021Dmitri Demidenko

The Fed is being too slow, isn’t it? However, look at the Swiss National
Bank! The SNB is to start monetary normalization later than both the Fed
and the ECB. How the central bank’s [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) will affect the Swiss franc?
Let us discuss the Forex outlook and make up a [USDCHF][1] trading plan.

## Weekly Swiss franc fundamental forecast

Unlike the Fed and the ECB, trying to convince financial markets that
the inflation surge will be temporary, the Swiss National Bank doesn’t
bother to calm down [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s. According to the SNB’s forecasts,
inflation will go up by just 0.4% in 2021; in 2022 and 2023, inflation
in Switzerland will grow by 0.6%. Although the SNB doesn’t rule out a
short-term exceeding of the CPI the upper border of the inflation target
range of 0%-1%, the regulator doesn’t believe that the inflation surge
will be long-term. If so, it won’t start normalizing the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
soon.

Unlike the FOMC meeting, having shocked the financial markets, the SNB’s
meeting was boring. The regulator kept the deposit rate at -0.75%, which
is the lowest among all central banks in the world, and expressed its
willingness to FX interventions to set back the franc strengthening.
SNB’s reserve assets increased by 35 billion francs in the first
quarter, which is evidence of the central bank’s forex interventions,
although the regulator will provide detailed information on June 30.

Thomas Jordan referred to the Swiss franc exchange rate as one of the
reasons for the low inflation compared to other countries. From early
April to mid-June, the franc strengthened against the euro by 2.5%, and
against the US dollar - by 6%. Furthermore, European consumer prices
after a long time reached the ECB's target of 2%, and US inflation even
accelerated to 5%.

The inflation change suggests that the SNB will start monetary
normalization later than both the Fed and the ECB. The European Central
Bank is not willing to wind down the emergency asset purchase program,
at least until March 2022, and, most likely, will not raise the interest
rate before 2024. As for the deposit rate of -0.75%, which causes
criticism within Switzerland, the SNB will continue using the
differentiated approach without charging commercial banks.

It should be noted that even the rapid economic recovery does not
stimulate inflation in the country. According to forecasts of the Swiss
government, GDP will expand by 3.6% in 2021, and by 3.3% in 2022. The
previous March estimates for the current year figured at 3%. SNB is
talking about 3.5%.

Therefore, everything is relative in Forex. If someone says the Fed is
too slow to tighten the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), the SNB is going to move even
slower. This fact, provided there no urgent political risks in Europe,
to which the CHF is rather responsive, the [USDCHF][1] uptrend could
reverse down.

### Weekly [USDCHF][1] trading plan

I suggest two scenarios for the market situation ahead of the US
employment report. The first one implies the breakout of the resistance
at 0.922-0.923 will send the [USDCHF][1] up to 0.9355 and higher. The
second one means the pair should consolidate ahead of the Us jobs
report, which will allow buying or selling the pair when the price
breaks out the upper or lower border of the trading range of
0.914-0.924.
