Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 29.06.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

The euro price went into correction with the target in the Intermediary
Zone 1.1887 - 1.1878.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

Today, after breaking out the support level of 72.45, the oil price went
into correction. Now it is profitable to consider sales with a target in
the Intermediary Zone 71.50 - 71.24.

The resistance zone of 73.60 - 72.80 is suitable to enter sales. Wait
for a price correction in this zone and look for a sell pattern.

For oil purchases, it is necessary to update yesterday's high.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

Sell from the zone of 73.60 - 72.80. TakeProfit: Intermediary Zone 71.50
- 71.24. StopLoss: 73.89.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

The gold is trading in the sideways trend between level 1794 and 1774.
Now sellers are trying to break out the support level. If successful,
then a price drop and an update of the June 18 low will occur.

If the price doesn't break out level 1774 again, then the growth will
begin with the target at level 1794.

It is profitable to hold sales or enter new ones as the short-term gold
downtrend continues.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

Open sell positions according to the pattern in 1794 - 1783. TakeProfit:
1762. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

Yesterday, the euro broke out the Additional Zone 1.1931 - 1.1926. Today
the support level of 1.1921 was broken out. Consequently, the price went
into correction with the target in the Intermediary Zone 1.1887 -
1.1878.

Today, it is profitable to hold euro sales entered in the zone of 1.1950
- 1.1926, as well as open new ones from the level of 1.1921 with the
beforementioned target. After updating yesterday's low, it will be
possible to take a part of the profit and transfer trades to breakeven.

Euro purchases will only be possible after the breakout of the
Additional Zone 1.1950 - 1.1946.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

Sell/Hold down sales entered in the zone of 1.1950 - 1.1926. TakeProfit:
Intermediary Zone 1.1887 - 1.1878. StopLoss: 1.1961.
