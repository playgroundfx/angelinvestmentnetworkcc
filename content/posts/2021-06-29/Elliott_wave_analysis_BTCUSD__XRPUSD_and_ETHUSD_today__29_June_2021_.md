Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 29.06.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

The cryptocurrencies could depreciate in the next few days. Therefore,
it is relevant to sell.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

The BTCUSD market continues forming the impulse down wave [A]. After the
corrective wave (4) completed as a complex pattern composed of sub-waves
W-X-Y, the price started declining in the impulse wave (5). There could
be unfolding the sideways corrective wave 4 as a flat [A]-[B]-[C]. Wave
4 should end soon, and the market will resume falling to a level of the
previous low 28750.00. One could enter sell trades in the current
situation.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Sell 34912.50, TP 28750.00

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

There continues forming the impulse down wave C, which should conclude
the global bearish zigzag (W), composed of five sub-waves
[1]-[2]-[3]-[4]-[5]. After the zigzag-shaped correction [4] completed,
the market has started forming the impulse wave [5]. There must be
developing the final wave of wave [5]. The market should be declining in
impulse [5] of a smaller degree to a level of 0.500. One could enter
short trades in the current situation.

the beginning of a larger bearish zigzag. After the corrective wave [4]
completed, the market has started declining in the bear impulse [5].
