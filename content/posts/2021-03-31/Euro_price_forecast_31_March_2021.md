Euro is falling deeper. Forecast as of 31.03.2021Dmitri Demidenko

The single European currency seemed to have reached the bottom, but the
downtrend continued. The [EURUSD][1] is falling and could reach level
1.1. Let us discuss the Forex outlook and make up a trading plan.

## Fundamental euro forecast today

The market is a place of competition between people, who, on the one
hand, are too cautious to go ahead and, on the other hand, fear to miss
out. It would seem unreasonable to take active steps ahead of the US
jobs report, as Fed refers to weak employment justifying its decision to
hold the accommodative monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) for a long time. However,
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are confident in the US Labor market's positive changes and
have drawn the [EURUSD][1] price to the bottom of figure 17 before the
release.

Obviously, the US dollar primary growth driver in 2021 is the Treasury
yields rally. In early January, 10-year Treasury yield was 0.91%, and
Bloomberg experts expected that by the end of the year, it would grow to
1.25%, at best - to 1.5%. However, the yield hit 1.77% in early March!
Too high and too fast for anyone to resist the growing appeal of US
assets and the strengthening US dollar.

### Dynamics of US Treasury yields

If the bond yield rally drives the USD index up, it is easy to guess
that the [EURUSD][1] downtrend is based on the expectations of the
fiscal stimulus boost, increase in the Treasuries issue, and the growth
in the US GDP rate. In this regard, the figure of a new aid package from
Joe Biden of $ 4 trillion, which appeared in the press, quite logically
raised the US bond yields, strengthening the greenback. The more money
comes into the economy, the more bonds are issued, the higher is the
yield. Why should [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s hold the papers with a 0.91% yield when they
can buy them with a yield of 1.77% at the auctions?

Rising market borrowing costs press down the US stock indexes. It is
especially harmful to technological companies’ stocks, whose
capitalization significantly increased in 2020 and now looks overvalued.
The drop in the [S&P 500][2] and the [Nasdaq Composite][3] is usually
perceived as a deterioration in global risk appetite, which is
beneficial for safe-haven currencies, first of all, the US dollar.

The situation is unlikely to be improved by the IMF's intention to raise
the global GDP forecast for 2021. The January estimate assumed the
growth of gross domestic product by 5.5%. The large-scale fiscal
stimulus and rapid vaccination in the USA are forcing Kristalina
Georgieva's team to increase the expected growth. If the world economy
developed in sync, it could help the euro. Nonetheless, the forecast is
likely to be raised due to the United States alone. American exclusivity
is a reason to buy the greenback.

The euro continues falling, and even the rise of the German inflation
rate to 2% in March can’t support the single European currency.

### [EURUSD][1] trading plan today

The [EURUSD][1] bulls hoped to find support, but the pair continues
going down. The price reached the target at 1.72, defined [earlier][4],
and got close to the [next target at 1.168][5]. I suppose the US jobs
report will help the bears reach the target. Nonetheless, a substantial
drop ahead of the important [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) release increases the chance of the
price rebound up from the levels of 1.168 and 1.164.
