Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 31.03.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

Yesterday, the short-term gold trend reversed down by breaking out the
key support 1705 - 1700.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

Yesterday, oil broke out the Additional Zone 60.95 - 60.83. The US
trading session closed the price below the level. This indicates that
the correction in the short-term uptrend may reach the trend border in
the zone of 59.68 - 59.42.

Today, it is profitable to look for sales in the resistance of 61.34 -
61.21. The targets for sales will be levels 60.30 and 59.57.

It will be relevant to buy the WTI oil if the price breaks out the
Additional Zone 61.34 - 61.21 and consolidates above 61.34 at the US
session.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

Sell according to the pattern in Additional Zone 61.34 - 61.21.
TakeProfit: 60.30, 59.57. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

Yesterday, the short-term gold trend reversed down by breaking out the
key support 1705 - 1700. Now the price is correcting. It is profitable
to sell gold in the zone 1705 - 1701 according to the pattern. The sales
target will be the support level of 1678.

For gold purchases, a breakout of the Additional Zone 1705 - 1702 and
price consolidation at the US session higher are required. In this case,
it will be possible to open a long trade with the first target in the
Intermediary Zone 1732 - 1727.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

Open sell positions according to the pattern in 1705 - 1701. TakeProfit:
1678. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

The EURUSD price broke out the Gold Zone 1.1750 - 1.1742 yesterday. The
next target within the short-term downtrend is Target Zone 2 1.1670 -
1.1654.

Ahead of a European trading session, there is a correction to
yesterday's fall. It will be relevant to sell euro in the zone of 1.1763
- 1.1744. The first target will be the support level of 1.1707. The
trend border is shifting to levels 1.1792 - 1.1784.

There is no reason to buy the euro at the moment.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

Open sell positions according to the pattern in 1.1744 - 1.1763.
