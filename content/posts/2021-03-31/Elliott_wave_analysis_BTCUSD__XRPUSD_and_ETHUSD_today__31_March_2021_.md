Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 31.03.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

Ripple must have finished forming the corrective wave, there is
developing the initial part of the bearish impulse.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

There is forming the final leg of the upward impulse wave 1-2-3-4-5.
There is forming wave 5. The upward impulse wave [3] must have
completed, so the price should be declining in wave [4]. The price is
likely to go down to level 56938.00. Next, the price will resume rising
in wave [5] to a level of 65000.00. One could enter short trades in the
current situation.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Sell 58640.00, TP 56938.00

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

The Ripple price chart must have completed forming the ending diagonal
1-2-3-4-5. Therefore, there is forming the beginning of the bearish wave
C, which should be a simple impulse [1]-[2]-[3]-[4]-[5]. If the
presumption is correct, the Ripple price should be declining over the
next few days. The price could go down to level 0.472, marked by the
corrective wave (2).

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] today:

Sell 0.549, TP 0.472

## Elliott wave Ethereum analysis

After the corrective wave 4 finished in the ending diagonal 1-2-3-4-5,
there has started developing the final zigzag [a]-[b]-[c]. Based on the
market structure, the first impulse wave [a] of this zigzag must have
completed. The Ethereum price should be declining in the corrective wave
[b]. The [b] correction should be short and could end at a level of
1752.00. Next, the ETHUSD price should resume growing in the impulse
wave [c], as outlined in the chart. One could enter sell trades in the
current situation.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Sell 1821.80, TP 1752.00
