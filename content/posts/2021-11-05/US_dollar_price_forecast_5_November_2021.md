Dollar benefits from rival’s mistake. Forecast as of 05.11.2021Dmitri
Demidenko

When the greenback's rivals act together, the problems with one of them
could cause troubles for the rest. The BoE's unwillingness to raise the
interest rates encouraged [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s to sell off the pounв, pressing down
the [EURUSD][1]. Let us discuss the Forex outlook and make up a trading
plan.

## Weekly US dollar fundamental forecast

Study, study, and study again! Other central banks should follow the
example of how the Fed deals with financial markets. Although Jerome
Powell linked the federal funds rate hike to the achievement of full
employment, which, in his opinion, will happen in mid-2022, the chances
of monetary restriction have not increased at all. The market has
responded with a rise in stock indexes, which suggests that the Fed
believes in maintaining ultra-easy monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) for a long time.
Unlike the Fed, the BoE made a communication mistake, pressing down the
pound and the euro.

Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said it wasn't his job to guide
financial markets on interest rates, hitting back against criticism that
he misled [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s. Traders had expected the BOE to raise borrowing
costs in November and were disappointed by the decision to keep the
interest rate unchanged. The UK bond yields and the pound dropped after
the report that the MPC voted seven to two to keep borrowing costs
unchanged.

### Dynamics of GBP and UK bond yields

Interest rates are a global market. Central banks are falling short of
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s' expectations to make aggressive monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) moves.
Regulators are signaling that their paths will be different, and
normalizing monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) will take longer than expected.

The October rally in global bond yields has its leaders. The fastest-
growing yields were on 2-year bonds of Canada and the UK; they featured
the biggest rise since 2008 and 2011, 50 basis points. For comparison,
the US peers increased by 19 basis points during the same period. The
better rise in the yields on papers issued by Fed's competitors
contributed to the corrections of the dollar pairs. As soon as the Bank
of England disappointed [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s, the yields of the global bond market
fell, and the greenback is again among the favorites.

It is not surprising considering that the US jobs report will be
published soon. According to Bloomberg experts, US nonfarm payrolls are
expected to rise by 450,000 in October. However, given the improvement
in the epidemiological situation, I suppose the actual data could be
better. The report from the Labor Department showed that unit labor
costs in the US rose at an annual rate of 8.3% in the third quarter, the
highest rate since 2014.

If more companies raise prices to protect profits amid steadily rising
labor costs, high inflation in the US economy will last much longer than
the Fed expects. The central bank will be forced to raise the federal
funds rate, which will support the dollar.

### Weekly [EURUSD][1] trading plan

Thus, the weakness of the greenback rivals resulted from a decline in
the global bond yields and the expectations of the US strong jobs report
sent the [EURUSD][1] down to a 16-month low. A pleasant surprise from
nonfarm payrolls will set the target of 1.145.
