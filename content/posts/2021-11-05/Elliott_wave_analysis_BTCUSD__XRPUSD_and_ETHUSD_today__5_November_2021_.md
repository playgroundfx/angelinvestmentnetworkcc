Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 05.11.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

Bitcoin and Ethereum must be forming triangle corrections. Ripple is
likely to have completed the linking wave X and should start declining.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

The BTCUSD market is forming the corrective wave [B], with the bullish
impulse wave (C) developing inside. The fourth leg of the (C) impulse,
correction 4, should be developing now. Correction 4 could be unfolding
as a contracting triangle [A]-[B]-[C]-[D]-[E]. The middle leg of the
triangle, sub-wave [C], should finish at a level of 58840.00, where it
will be 76.4% of wave [B]. An approximate trajectory of the Bitcoin
future price movement is outlined in the chart.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Sell 62120.50, TP 58840.00

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

The XRPUSD market must have completed the global linking wave X as a
triple zigzag composed of sub-waves [W]-[X]-[Y]-[X]-[Z]. Next, the
market has turned down and started declining, which can signal the start
of a new bearish trend. There should be forming the initial part of the
down impulse wave. Sub-waves 1 and 2 have finished, so the price should
be declining in impulse 3 to a level below 1.142.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] **** today:

Sell 1.192, TP 1.142

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

The ETHUSD market is forming corrective wave B, with the impulse upwave
[C] developing inside. There is forming the final part of the [C] wave.
There should be forming the horizontal corrective wave (4) as an
expanding triangle A-B-C-D-E. The corrective wave D must have completed,
so the price should be declining in the down wave E, which will conclude
the triangle pattern. Wave E could be a simple zigzag [A]-[B]-[C]. The
first impulse wave [A] could finish at a level of 4300.00.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Sell 4536.07, TP 4300.00
