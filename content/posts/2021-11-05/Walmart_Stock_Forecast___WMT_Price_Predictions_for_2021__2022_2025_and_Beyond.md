Walmart Stock Forecast: Why Are The Shares Low?Jana Kane

Walmart holds the position of the world’s largest retailer. It's a
common name in the [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/). Its stores are known the world over. Still,
Walmart’s shares are not as expensive as they could be. What are the
reasons for this? Will WMT shares go up? Let's discover analysts'
Walmart stock predictions and recommendations on Walmart’s shares.

The article covers the following subjects:

## A Brief Overview of Walmart's Shares

Walmart Inc. was established in 1945. The enterprise (known as Wal-Mart
Stores, Inc. until February 2018) is made up of Walmart US, Walmart
International, and Sam's Club. The company is an operator in retail,
wholesale, and other sectors globally. It manages around 11,400 stores
and e-commerce [website](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/website-for-forex-trading/)s under 54 banners in 26 countries. Walmart Inc.
is based in Bentonville, Arkansas.

Check some data on [Walmart stock][1] (NYSE: WMT):

  * Market cap: $399.74 billion
  * Shares outstanding: 2,814 million
  * Public float:1.44 billion
  * P/E ratio: 33.03
  * Payout ratio: 36.97% (Based on This Year's Estimates)
  * EPS (Most Recent Fiscal Year): $5.48
  * Dividend Yield: 1.55%
  * Annual dividend: $2.20
  * PEG Ratio (5-year expected): 3.27
  * Average volume: 8.92 million shares
  * WMT Dividend Frequency: Quarterly Dividend
  * WMT Three Year Dividend Growth: 5.88%

How much is WMT stock today? The current Walmart stock quote is 150.23
US dollar.

[Walmart Inc.][2] became publicly traded on October 1, 1970. The company
managed to sell the first stock at $16.50. There were subsequently 9
stock splits, each at a two-to-one ratio. The first one took place on
August 25, 1975.

Walmart raises its dividends constantly, increasing them by an average
of 1.92% each year. When such a giant company as Walmart splits its
shares, the market capitalization before and after the split doesn't
change significantly. It means the stockholder owns more shares, but
they are valued at a lower price per share.

## Major Factors That Will Affect Walmart Inc. In 2021 & Beyond

There is a number of factors that trigger price volatility. For the
stock market, they include a company's financial outlook, global
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) sentiment, and strong demand/supply, along with internal
company [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) and industry events. Walmart is the largest retailer, both
domestically and internationally. Thus, events in the retail industry
will have a significant impact on its stock price.

### Earnings Reports

Quarterly earnings expectations and actual reports are some of the key
factors that drive the company's shares. Financial projections make the
stocks move ahead of a release of earnings data. If you check the
reasons for [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) price movements, you will notice that Walmart's
share price reacts strongly to earnings releases. Positive data lead to
stock appreciation and vice versa.

### International Business

The company provides operations in retail and e-commerce segments in 24
countries across the globe and sources products from over 100 nations.
Walmart frequently refocuses its international business. News regarding
mergers or sales of a business will lead to stock
appreciation/depreciation depending on the context of the deal. In 2021,
the company is focusing on the Indian market. The enterprise is
reorganizing its footprint in the country that will help to compete with
Amazon.

### Competition

The main competitor to Walmart Inc. is Amazon. The company handled the
post-Covid retail landscape better than its rivals. Walmart's US
e-commerce growth exceeded the growth of Amazon's retail sales. Also,
the company launched Walmart+, which competes with Amazon Prime. To
increase customer loyalty, the company created a convenient return
system. A customer can return items in-store, for free by mail, and via
a scheduled pick-up from their home. They will receive a full refund for
the purchases. Better products and services will lead to an increase in
the stock price.

### Gun Issues

It may sound strange, but Walmart is frequently in the [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) due to
shootings in its stores. Any kind of shooting or even the suggestion of
shooting can cause the stock price to drop. If the company manages to
implement any new rules to protect its customers, it will support the
strength of its equities.

### Flipkart IPO

Walmart's Flipkart is going to hold a US IPO in the fourth quarter of
2021. The IPO is expected to more than double the company's investment
as it could value Walmart at $45-$50 billion.

## Walmart Stock Forecast for 2021: Analysts’ Recommendations

What is the future of Walmart’s stock? The average [twelve-month price
target][3] of 27 Wall Street analysts is $162.71. The highest potential
target is $181.00; the lowest possible price is $131.00. If you are not
sure whether you should buy or sell, the consensus rating for WMT stocks
is "Buying." There is only 1 “Sell” stock rating and 5 "holding"
ratings. Below you can find Walmart stock price predictions and
recommendations by analysts as of May 19, 2021.

### Paul Lejuez, Citigroup

Paul Lejuez, the analyst at Citigroup, raised Walmart's stock price
target from $172 to $179, maintaining the "Strong Buy" rating.

### Michael Lasser, UBS

Michael Lasser at UBS increased the price target for Walmart’s shares to
$170 from $160, keeping the "Strong Buy" rating.

### Paul Trussell, Deutsche Bank

Paul Trussell at Deutsche Bank was even more optimistic and changed the
price target from $165 to $181. He also maintained the "Strong Buy"
rating.

### Morgan Stanley

Morgan Stanley analyst’s report claimed an increase in the stock price
to $160 from $154. The recommendation is still a "Strong Buy."

### Bill Kirk, MKM Partners

Bill Kirk at MKM Partners increased the price to $152 from $141.
However, his recommendation is "Hold."

## Walmart Inc. Shares: Technical Analysis

Let's perform a technical analysis of the monthly chart to determine the
global sentiment in the [Walmart][4] stock market.

Since October 2015, another wave of a bullish trend has been forming in
the market (marked with a blue line). Let's overlay a [Fibonacci][5]
grid on the chart to reveal life cycles based on the [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) of Walmart
stock prices and to understand current processes more deeply.

As a result, three trend development zones, which are worth paying
attention to, are visible:

  * Gray zone of the trend base (1) - from 0 to 0.236 at Fibonacci levels. The price in it creates the risk of ending the trend

  * Red zones of consolidation (2) - from 0.236 to 0.5. Strong support and resistance levels are located at the borders of these zones. If you study the movement of the WMT/USD price in the past, it will become clear that it has repeatedly stopped in this zone.

  * Green zone (3) - from 0.5 to 0.618. At the moment, it marks the zone of [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) highs. The exit of the price here will be met with strong resistance from sellers.

The absence of dynamic growth zones is explained by the low dynamics of
the trend and the presence of long, dynamic corrections, which may
indirectly indicate the weakness of the trend or its imminent end.

As can be seen on the chart above, the uptrend formed from March to
August of this year stopped within the upper border of the second
Fibonacci zone. The ATH* level at 153 USD was also involved here. The
decreasing volumes, in this case, are only a confirmation that the price
is in the consolidation zone.

*ATH – price decline from the highest price.

Given the low activity of buyers, the most likely scenario for the next
year is the continuation of the trend with a gradual transformation to a
sideways trend. The expected growth of the price is limited by the green
line of the [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) high. It is possible to test it in the coming
months, but an analysis of lower timeframes is needed for more accurate
estimates.

### Walmart stock forecast for next three months

Let's conduct a technical analysis of the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) timeframe to make a
forecast for the next three months that will help to understand market
processes better.

The upward surge that began in early October is confirmed by the signal
of the [MACD][6] indicator, the indicator curve crosses the signal line
from the bottom up (blue mark on the chart).

As a result, a corrective wave in the form of a triangle with completed
waves A, B, C, D is formed on the price chart.

The internal structure of the figure confirms this assumption. It is
known from Elliot's theory that triangles have a 3-3-3-3-3 structure.
The first four supposed waves have a three-wave structure (blue lines in
the chart above). Consequently, wave E will probably develop with a
target around 135 USD in the next three months.

### Walmart price forecast for 2021

To estimate [Walmart][7] stock's trading potential and make a realistic
forecast for the next 12 months, we will examine the change in Bollinger
Bands' width and draw price projections for each month.



The wave D must have formed already. If the current correction
continues, the Walmart stock price may continue growing to 153 USD. The
next fifth wave will likely stop in the red consolidation zone. The
price target of 135 USD may be reached towards the end of the year.

Since we haven't identified any global trend reversal signs during the
technical analysis of Walmart shares on the monthly chart, we will
presume the global trend will continue in the projected fifth wave. So,
the price may be expected to reverse to the upside at the end of 2021 or
the beginning of 2022, the price target being in the third Fibo zone.
The all-time high may be updated at around 170 - 180 USD. Then, a
corrective wave pattern may replace projected growth. The nearest strong
support level is around the global blue trend line. That level is highly
likely to be tested next year.

The table below presents an expected Walmart trading range for each
month.

#### Walmart Long-Term Trading Plan

Here's a long-term trading plan for Walmart shares based on the above
analysis.

Earlier, we made sure the market was consolidating in a global
corrective wave. The long-term uptrend is likelier to continue, so at
least one more ascending wave can be expected to form. An exit to the
upside from the current triangle will be the most obvious sign of its
beginning.

At the same time, the technical analysis of the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) chart suggests the
price can drop to the triangle's lower limit in the short term. There,
at 135 USD, lies the best point for buying. Stop Loss should be placed
below the last local low, underneath the limit between zone 1 and 2, at
around 130 US dollars (the red line).

[WMT/USD][7] projected price target is around 170 USD, the green line on
the chart. We can also fix half the position at around 158 USD, the
limit between zone 2 and 3.

## WMT Stock Forecast for 2022

price for January 2022 is $155.918, the closing price for the end of
next year is $175.039. The highest price doesn't differ from the opening
and closing prices. It signals low price volatility, which is positive

## Long-Term Walmart Stock Forecast for 2025 and Beyond

What is Walmart's stock forecast for the next 5 years? If you compare
the end of 2023 when the price is expected to stay at $194.333, and the
beginning of 2025 with the rate of $214.055, you will notice a narrow
gap between the two. It means that the future growth of Walmart's shares
will be limited within the next 5 years. However, there will be a stable
long-term uptrend, which is more crucial for long-term investments.

As you can see, there is no Walmart stock projection for the second half
of 2026 and beyond. The reason for this lies in the frequent market
changes. Analysts and market experts don't provide such long-term
Walmart shares price predictions as they are very approximate and
reviewed constantly.

## Walmart's Price History: A Timeline

Historical accuracy plays a significant role when talking about the
future price of an asset. It would be interesting to consider the stock
performance since the company became publicly traded, but we don't have
enough time to do that in its entirety. That's why we will look at the
price movements over the last 3 years.

On January 29, 2018, [Walmart stocks][1] reached their then highest rate
of $109.98. Nevertheless, it was a turning point for the overall trend.
By June, the shares slid to $81.81. 2018 wasn't a positive year for
Walmart Inc. The company's shares couldn't climb even after a better-
than-expected third-quarter earnings report published in November.

Additional internal improvements didn’t support the stock’s price
either. The company began implementing StrongArm Technologies Fuse Risk
Management Platform at its warehouses. The platform aims at targeted
injury reduction. Why was Walmart’s stock down? The decline in the
share’s price was caused by general market volatility, worries about the
company's digital strategy and acquisition moves.

In 2019, the company's shares recovered while an upward trend prevailed.
Walmart performed well; earnings reports beat market expectations,
pushing the share’s price up. In July and the first half of August, the
stocks were declining due to deadly shootings at Walmart's Mississippi
store in July, and then at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas in August. Later,
the price recovered as the enterprise stopped selling short-barrel rifle
ammunition, handgun ammunition, and handguns in Alaska. Additionally,
the company asked clients to stop carrying firearms in stores.

Throughout February-March 2020, the stocks experienced enormous
volatility. While most of the companies suffered from a stock crash,
Walmart's equities moved up and down. The company stayed above water as
consumers spent more of their disposable cash on food and essentials,
instead of on vacations or dining out.

The company managed to adapt to the changing reality caused by Covid-19.
Walmart Inc. implemented a Walmart+ membership service for unlimited
free delivery, in-store Scan & Go checkouts, and discounts on fuel.
Also, Walmart benefited from stimulus checks and unemployment benefits
that increased consumer spendings. On November 30, the price reached an
all-time high of $152.95.

At the end of the year, the US Department of Justice sued the company
for contributing to America's opioid crisis. The lawsuit claimed Walmart
Inc. forced its staff to fill prescriptions ASAP and withheld
information from pharmacists, indicating that such orders were not for
medical purposes. This event added to the downtrend that continued until
the beginning of March 2021. In March, the bullish trend began.
Impressive earnings and revenue data for the first quarter supported the
price in May.

## Is It Good to Invest in Walmart (WMT)?

It seems Walmart's stocks are undervalued. Although the corporation is
the world's largest retailer and it became publicly traded a long time
ago, its shares are quite cheap. How much will Walmart’s stock be worth
in 10 years? Have a look at the projected stock performance for the next
10 years.
