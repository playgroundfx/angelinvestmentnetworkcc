Bank of England started a fire. Review as of 05.11.2021Dmitri Demidenko

In case of fire, exit the building before tweeting about it.

## Andrew Bailey doesn't do what he says

The market was courting the Bank of England so hard, pushing it to raise
the REPO rate at the meeting in November, but the BoE upped and kept it
at the same level! Was it worth the effort then? Was it worth raising
the UK bond yield so high? Andrew Bailey said at the Monetary Policy
Committee's press conference that controlling markets wasn't his duty.
Well, why does he then make promises he cannot keep? Why did he give
false hope saying the central bank would have to step in to handle
soaring inflation?

A few days before the Bank of England's November meeting, HSBC made a
shocking forecast: Andrew Bailey would vote to keep the REPO rate at the
previous level! Andrew Bailey, whose hawkish comments had driven
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s' hopes for the most aggressive monetary restriction in the
past decades to their highest! Investors had believed borrowing costs
would grow to 1.25% at the end of 2022! In the end, HSBC's forecast was
prophetic, and GBP bulls were punched in the face.

That drama starring the Bank of England became another episode in a
thriller about the fight between central banks and financial markets.
Earlier, Christine Lagarde failed to dissuade [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s from their
allegedly incorrect forecasts about the ECB's first rate hike; the
Reserve Bank of Australia refused to control the 3-year bond yield
curve, recognizing its defeat; finally, the Fed confirmed that its love
for the market was mutual. The total score isn't currently in the
central banks' favor, and the ECB's and BoE's examples show that one
doesn't simply attack [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s.

It's uneasy to survive in such conditions. One can jump into the water
to escape bees and be eaten by piranhas. Some currencies are going from
one extreme to another. For example, the Japanese yen, sold amid growing
yields of the global bond market. However, once the BoE disappointed the
market, bond rates plunged together with the [USDJPY][1]. And who knows
how its correction will end.

As for the pound sterling, there's still hope. The Monetary Policy
Committee has got two dissidents that voted to raise the REPO rate. That
means monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) might be tightened at the next meetings. The Bank
of England needs to remember that in case of fire, one should exit the
building before tweeting about it. Losing hope, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s might set fire
to the market. And that will do no good to any authority.
