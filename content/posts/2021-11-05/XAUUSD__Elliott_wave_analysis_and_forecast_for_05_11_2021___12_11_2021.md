XAUUSD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 05.11.2021 –
12.11.2021Alex Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions from corrections above the
level of 1721.11 with a target of 1915.00 – 2075.27.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
1721.11 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of
1673.63 – 1602.20.

 **Analysis:** Daily chart: an ascending third wave of larger degree (3)
is formed, a descending correction has developed as the fourth wave (4),
and the fifth wave (5) appears to be unfolding, with the first wave of
smaller degree 1of (5) formed inside. H4 chart: apparently, a corrective
wave 2 of (5) is completed, and wave 3 of (5) has started unfolding,
with wave i of 3 formed inside. On the H1 chart, a correction finished
developing as wave ii of 3, supposedly, and wave iii of 3 has started to
form, with wave (ii) of iii completed as part of it. If the presumption
is correct, the pair will continue to rise to the levels of 1915.00 –
2075.27. The level of 1721.11 is critical in this scenario as a breakout
will enable the pair to continue declining to the levels of 1673.63 –
1602.20.
