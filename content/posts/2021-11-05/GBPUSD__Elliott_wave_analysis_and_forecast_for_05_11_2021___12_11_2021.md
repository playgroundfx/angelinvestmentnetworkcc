GBPUSD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 05.11.2021 –
12.11.2021Alex Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 1.3831 with a target of 1.3157 – 1.2831.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
1.3831 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 1.4050 –
1.4241.

 **Analysis:** Daily chart: the first wave of larger degree (1) is
formed, and a downside correction continues forming as wave (2). H4
chart: waves A of (2) and B of (2) are formed, and wave C of (2) is
developing. Apparently, the first wave of smaller degree i of C is
formed on the H1 chart. If this assumption is correct, the pair will
continue to fall to 1.3157 – 1.2831 once a local correction forms as
wave ii of C. The level of 1.3831 is critical in this scenario as a
breakout will enable the pair to continue rising to the levels of 1.4050
– 1.4241.
