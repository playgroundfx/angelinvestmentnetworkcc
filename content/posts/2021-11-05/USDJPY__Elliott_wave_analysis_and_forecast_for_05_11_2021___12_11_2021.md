USDJPY: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 05.11.2021 –
12.11.2021Alex Geuta

 **Main scenario:** long positions will be relevant above the level of
112.75 with a target of 116.00 – 118.00 once a correction has formed.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
112.75 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of 110.83
– 109.12.

 **Analysis:** Daily chart: there's an ascending wave of larger degree C
that has presumably started forming. The third wave 3 of (1) of С is
unfolding as part of the wave C.

H4 chart: a correction is completed as wave ii of 3, and wave iii of 3
is forming. On the H1 chart, apparently, wave (iii) of iii is formed,
and a local correction is nearing completion as wave (iv) of iii, with
wave c of (iv) forming as part of it. If the presumption is correct, the
pair will continue to rise to the levels of 116.00 – 118.00 after the
correction is completed. The level of 112.75 is critical in this
scenario as its breakout will enable the pair to continue declining to
the levels of 110.83 – 109.12.
