USDCHF: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 05.11.2021 –
12.11.2021Alex Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 0.9225 with a target of 0.8924 – 0.8860.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
0.9225 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 0.9368 –
0.9506.

 **Analysis:** A descending first wave of larger degree (1) of 5 is
presumably formed on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) chart, and a correction continues
developing as the second wave (2) of 5, with wave B of (2) forming
inside. An ascending correction is completed as wave b of B on the H4
chart, and wave v of C is currently forming. The third wave of smaller
degree (iii) of c appears to be developing on the H1 chart, with a
corrective wave iv of (iii) forming inside. If the presumption is
correct, the pair will continue to drop to the levels of 0.8924 –
0.8860. The level of 0.9225 is critical in this scenario. Its breakout
will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 0.9368 – 0.9506.
