Forecast for XAU/USD: Gold churns out recordsDmitri Demidenko

## Fundamental forecast for gold for today

### Precious metal climbed too high

It’s done! What gold bugs had been dreaming about for decades happened:
the price has reached a level of $2,000 per ounce. The weakness of the
US dollar, the fall of the 10-year U.S. Bond yield to unbelievable minus
1%, and unstoppable growth of [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/) reserves did their work. Meanwhile,
gold bugs grew much older: according to JP Morgan’s research, the
precious metal is usually bought by aged [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s, while young traders
prefer Bitcoin or high-tech stocks.



Many may find it surprising that gold is growing amidst the rally of US
stock indexes. That often happens during recessions, though: enormous
volumes of central banks’ cheap liquidity allow [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s to build up
long positions in risky and reliable assets. What’s more, the market
prefers precious metals when it’s unsure about GDP’s recovery.

Even if gold climbed high, there are still a lot of bullish forecasts:
Goldman Sachs believes that the prices may go up to $2300 per ounce
because [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are looking for a new reserve currency; RBC Capital
Markets projects a level of $3,000.



[XAU/USD][2] bulls may have succeeded because the recession didn’t
follow the 2007-2009 scenario. Then, the Fed’s monetary stimuli were
enough for getting the economy back to the trend; now, it’s unclear.
Then, the USD was growing as the US GDP’s recovery rate was faster than
its global peers’ one; now, it’s falling amidst the economic divergence
of growth. Then, the idea that inflation would speed up amidst increased
money supply failed; now, it’s still alive. The difference between then
and now allows us to say that gold hasn’t stop rallying yet.



The best scenario for gold would be a W-shape recovery of the US
economy. It implies extending monetary and fiscal stimuli, further
weakening the USD, and a drop in real US bond yields. However, a V-shape
recovery of GDP will allow [XAU/USD][2] quotes to grow too. A long-term
downtrend of the USD index is doubtless. At the same time, the Fed makes
it clear that it’s ready to tolerate high inflation, which will raise
the bond market rates.

The second coronavirus wave in Europe is the main factor in the
development of the bullish scenario for gold. Under this scenario, the
euro will fall, the USD index will grow and will probably continue
growing as the divergence of economic growth will benefit the USA. That
scenario is unlikely to happen. So, hold [your long positions formed at
$1820-1825 per ounce][4] and build them up during retracements.
[XAU/USD][2] may correct on the Congress’s approval of a new fiscal
relief package and strong stats on the US labor market.
