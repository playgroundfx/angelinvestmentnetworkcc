EUR/USD forecast: will dollar come back into the game?Dmitri Demidenko

## Fundamental U.S. dollar forecast for today

### The second wave of the pandemic in Europe, a fresh fiscal stimulus
adopted by the Congress or trade wars. What will trigger the EUR/USD
correction?

Based on the [EUR/USD][1] price chart, the positions of bears look weak.
It seems that, following the sharp rally in June, the euro buyers should
wait a little and take some profits, which would start a correction
down. In fact, the correction turned out to be short and shallow, and
the price drop to the bottom of figure 17 has immediately started a [new
wave of purchases][2]. The difficult epidemiological situation in the
USA associated with the uncertainty about the US economic recovery and
the drop in the real Treasury yield make [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s sell off the dollar.
However, not all analysts are confident in the grim outlook of the US
dollar.

BofA Merrill Lynch warns that the market is too negative about the
dollar, and the USD looks oversold. A bet against the dollar is a bet on
the chance that the COVID-19 vaccination will start sooner rather than
later. If it doesn’t happen shortly, Europe may face the second wave of
the pandemic, which will make [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s exit the [EUR/USD][1] longs,
entered based on the idea of the divergence in the economic rebound of
the euro-area and the USA. According to Westpac, the euro-dollar
purchases resulted from the US poor management, as Congress has failed
to reach an agreement on the extension of the financial aid package
before the expiration of the former stimulus. Once the democrats and the
republicans find a compromise, the dollar will gain back some of the
losses.

In my opinion, the [EUR/USD][1] future price trend will depend on the US
jobs report for July, and next, on the outcomes of the negotiations
between Washington and Beijing. The idea of the US-China trade war is
again acute. US and Chinese officials are going to hold a six-month
review of the implementation of their Phase 1 trade deal during an
August 15 video conference. In the meanwhile, the US-China trade
relations are increasingly tense. China had pledged to boost purchases
of US goods by some $200 billion, including a $77-billion increase in
the imports of farm products in 2020-2021. However, the Chinese imports
of the US products have been below the levels of 2017 so far. China is
battered by the global coronavirus recession, the official Beijing asks
the US not to surprise with [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) political actions so that the Chinese
government can work calmly.

Investors still remember how the greenback strengthen amid the US-China
trade battles in 2018-2019. But it was about the currency of the winner
at those times. Now, the trade conflict escalation could be seen as
another failure of US management. When all the countries try to unite to
manage the pandemic, the U.S. seems to be hindering the global economic
recovery. Investors should also consider that, if China is unwilling to
reach an agreement with the US, it will actively diversify its foreign
exchange reserves, so the U.S. dollar will be weighed on.

Therefore, the former growth drivers of the U.S. dollar are likely to
fail. The euro, on the contrary, has many benefits to stand with a
strong reading of the US jobs report for July. The [EUR/USD][1] bulls
are looking forward to a correction to buy the euro cheaper. I recommend
holding the [long positions opened at level 1.173][2] and expecting the
publication of the US employment data.
