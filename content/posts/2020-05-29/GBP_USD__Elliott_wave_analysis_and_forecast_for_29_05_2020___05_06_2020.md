GBP/USD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 29/05/2020 –
05/06/2020Alex Geuta

## The pair [GBP/USD][1] remains likely to grow. Estimated pivot point
is at a level of 1.2158.

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions from corrections above the
level of 1.2158 with a target of 1.2477 – 1.2639.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
1.2158 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of 1.2020
– 1.1871.

 **Analysis:** Supposedly, the fifth wave of larger degree V finished
developing on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame, with wave  (С) of V completed
inside. The first wave (1) is developing on the H4 time frame, with wave
1 of (1) formed and a local correction completed as wave 2 of (1)
inside. Apparently, the third wave 3 of (1) started developing on the H1
time frame, with the wave of smaller degree i of 3 forming inside. If
the presumption is correct, the pair will continue to rise to the levels
of 1.2477 – 1.2639. The level of 1.2158 is critical in this scenario as
the breakout will enable the pair to continue declining to the levels of
1.2020 – 1.1871.
