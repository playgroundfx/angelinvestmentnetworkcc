USD/CHF: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 29/05/2020 –
05/06/2020Alex Geuta

## [USD/CHF][1] remains likely to fall. Estimated pivot point is at a
level of 0.9782.

 **Main scenario:** consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 0.9782 with a target of 0.9454 – 0.9238.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
0.9782 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 1.0024 –
1.0235.

 **Analysis:** Supposedly, the third descending wave of larger degree
(3) continues developing on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame, with wave 3 of (3)
forming inside. On the 4-hour time frame, a correction finished
developing in the form of wave ii of 3 and wave iii of 3 is forming.
Apparently, on the H1 time frame the third wave of smaller degree (iii)
of iii is forming , with wave ii of (iii) completed and wave iii of
(iii) forming inside. If the presumption is correct, the pair will
continue to drop to the levels of 0.9454 – 0.9238. The level of 0.9782
is critical in this scenario. Its breakout will allow the pair to
continue rising to the levels of 1.0024 – 1.0235.
