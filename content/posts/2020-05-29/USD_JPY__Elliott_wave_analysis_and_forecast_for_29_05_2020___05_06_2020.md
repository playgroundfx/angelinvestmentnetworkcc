USD/JPY: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 29/05/2020 –
05/06/2020Alex Geuta

## [USD/JPY][1] remains likely to grow. Estimated pivot point is at a
level of 106.77.

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions from corrections above the
level of 106.77 with a target of 109.51 – 111.80.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
106.77 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of 105.99
– 105.00.

 **Analysis:** On the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame, apparently a descending
correction of larger degree finished forming as wave B and wave С
started developing. On the H4 time frame, the first wave 1 of (1) of C
formed and a local correction finished forming as wave 2 of (1).
Apparently, wave  3 of (1) started forming on the H1 time frame. Inside
it, there’s the first wave i of 3 formed and a descending correction
developing as wave ii of 3. Wave (c) of ii is nearing completion as part
of wave ii of 3. If the presumption is correct, after correction, the
pair will continue to rise to the levels of 109.51 – 111.80. The level
of 106.77 is critical in this scenario as the breakout will enable the
pair to continue declining to the levels of 105.99 – 105.00.
