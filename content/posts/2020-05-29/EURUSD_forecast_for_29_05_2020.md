Dollar will pull the plugDmitri Demidenko

## US sanctions against China will make capitals flow out from Hong
Kong, which is a kind of gateway to the Chinese stock market

The [EUR/USD][1] bulls have drawn the price above the top of figure 10
encouraged by the EC willingness to issue €750 billion of bonds, and
their opponents haven’t been supported even by US weak domestic data.
The US GDP drop in the January-March period turned out to be deeper on a
quarterly basis (-5%) than it was previously expected (-4.8%). The
number of jobless claims over 10 weeks exceeded 40 million. However, the
past is in the past. The first quarter is over, the second one is going
to be the worst in the US [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/), however, the third can well be the
best. Unless the economic sentiment is down.

The euro is still being spurred by the EC plans to support the euro-area
economy, and the bulls use every good [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) bit to go ahead. The euro-
area economic sentiment in May has been a little up from the record low.
But this hasn’t discouraged the [EUR/USD][1] bulls. The talks about
unity in the euro area continue. Earlier, Germany, the major contributor
to the EU budget, strongly opposed the huge fiscal stimulus. Now,
everything has changed. Looks like the German government feels guilty
for the ruling of the Constitutional court that could blow the euro area
apart.

The European Commission will issue bonds, which will be repaid from the
EU budget by 2028. Italy and Spain will receive the major benefits, they
stand in line with grants and cheap loans worth €313 billion. Earlier,
the Southern countries resented that their debt would grow, now,
however, they can receive a part of the money for free. Formally, the
final decision on the financial aid plan will be taken on the EU summit
on June 19. Based on the market reaction, the plan should be easily
approved.

The euro could rise even higher if the US stocks didn’t stop growing.
The S&P 500 dipped as [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s awaited Washington’s response to China
tightening control over the city of Hong Kong. Donald Trump said he will
hold a press conference concerning this matter on May 29. Hong Kong is a
kind of gateway to China for US [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s. It provides relatively secure
access to the Chinese stock market. Besides, tight fixing of the Hong
Kong dollar to the greenback reduces currency risks to a minimum. The
capital outflow amid Washington’s potential sanctions may result in a
new turmoil in the US stock market.

According to JP Morgan, which advised to buy the S&P 500 in March,
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s now should take the profits and exit the purchases of the US
stocks. MUFG Bank notes that the hope for the quick rebound of the US
economy is still strong, but it will be fading away as [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s will be
getting more concerned about the US-China trade relations. This will
increase the demand for safe havens. In this environment, the
[EUR/USD][1] bulls should aim at holding the price above 1.105-1.1065.
