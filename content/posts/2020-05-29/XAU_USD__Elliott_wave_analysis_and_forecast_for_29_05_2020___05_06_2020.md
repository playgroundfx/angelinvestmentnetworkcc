XAU/USD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 29/05/2020 –
05/06/2020Alex Geuta

## The pair [XAU/USD][1] remains likely to fall. Estimated pivot point
is at a level of 1765.45.

 **Main scenario:** consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 1765.45 with a target of 1667.44 – 1634.13.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
1765.45 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 1798.83
– 1850.00.

 **Analysis:** Supposedly, an ascending correction of larger degree
finished developing in the form of wave (B) on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame,
with wave С of (B) formed inside. Apparently, the fifth wave v of C
finished developing on the H4 time frame, with wave (v) of v formed
inside. On the H1 time frame, wave (C) started developing. Inside it,
there is the first counter-trend wave of smaller degree (i) of i of 1 of
(C) formed and a local correction developing as wave (ii) of i. If the
presumption is correct, the pair will continue to fall to the levels of
1667.44 – 1634.13 after correction. The level of 1765.45 is critical in
this scenario as the breakout will enable the pair to continue growing
to the levels of 1798.83 – 1850.00.
