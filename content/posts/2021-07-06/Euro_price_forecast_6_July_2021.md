Euro: no initiative goes unpunished. Forecast as of 06.07.2021Dmitri
Demidenko

Everything has its time. There is time for a rise and time for a fall.
The US dollar has weakened a little following the US jobs report, but it
doesn’t mean the euro bulls will resume the uptrend. Let us discuss the
Forex outlook and make up a [EURUSD][1] trading plan.

## Weekly euro fundamental forecast

Stock index futures signal that the [S&P 50][2]0 will continue to rally
after the holidays and is likely to reach a 37th all-time high in 2021,
Treasury yields are declining, euro-area PMI has climbed to a 15-year
peak, and members of the ECB's Governing Council speculate that
inflation is about to recover. Why shouldn't the [EURUSD][3] bulls try
to draw the price up? They have failed to break out the resistance
1.188, will they try again?

Mixed US employment data sent the 10-year Treasury yield down to the
lowest level since March. The two-year yield has also rolled down.
Markets are signaling that the future of the economy is not as
optimistic as many assume, and the Fed will not start monetary
normalization soon. Hasn’t the [EURUSD][3] trend broken down yet? The
euro-area Composite Purchasing Managers’ Index hit its highest level
since June 2006. Furthermore, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s’ sentiment has been rising for
the fifth consecutive month, which suggests the euro-area economy is
recovering fast.

In fact, the growth boom in the euro area after the easing of more
coronavirus restrictions has already been anticipated by [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s and
priced in the euro-dollar rate. Investors lose confidence in the US
economic recovery, but the US growth is still far ahead of the other
countries. It is especially clear in comparison with the countries where
the spread of the COVID-19 delta variant could hinder the efforts of
governments and central banks. Furthermore, the weakness of EMs
currencies, resulted from economic downturns, will send up the trade-
weighted euro. The trade-weighted EUR has been meeting the ECB forecasts
so far. However, the rise in the TWI could encourage the ECB officials
for FX interventions, weakening the euro.

### Dynamics of [EURUSD][3] and trade-weighted EUR

Yes, Klaas Knot said the euro-area inflation was not dead and that one
should not over-estimate the ECB’s ability to determine what is
temporary inflation and what is not. Dutch central bank president
believes that the euro-area emergency asset-purchase program should end
in March 2022, as it was scheduled. The ECB forecasts inflation of 1.9%
this year. For 2022, the bank forecasts inflation to fall back to 1.5%.
If so, won’t they replace the PEPP with anything else?

Everybody knows that no initiative goes unpunished. The EURUSD bulls,
willing to drive the exchange rate up above 1.188, should be punished.
Too much positive has already been priced in the pair’s quotes.
Therefore, following a rise in the forecasts of the European Commission
for the eurozone, traders may start selling the facts after buying the
[news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/). Soon, the minutes of the FOMC June meeting will be published and
we should have a clue why the Fed has changed its view on the monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) and want to manage inflation.

### Weekly [EURUSD][3] trading plan

If the [EURUSD][3] breaks out the resistance of 1.188 the correction
could continue up to 1.1915 and 1.196, where it will be relevant to
sell.
