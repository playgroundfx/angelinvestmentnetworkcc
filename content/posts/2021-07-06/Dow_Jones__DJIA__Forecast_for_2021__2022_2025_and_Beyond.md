Jones price is an average of the prices of 30 companies from various
industries listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). Large
corporations that make up the U.S stock market index include Apple, Walt
Disney, Walmart, Nike, McDonald’s, Microsoft, and Coca-Cola.

In this Dow Jones forecast article, we will discuss the Dow Jones Stock
Index and look at its price [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/), factors that can affect the DJI,
what experts have to say, and prediction charts. Learn all this and more
in this Dow Jones outlook by LiteForex.

## About the Dow Jones Stock Index

The Dow Jones index is the oldest stock index in the United States. The
“Dow” or “DJI” was founded in 1896 by Charles Dow and Edward Jones.
Originally, the Dow Jones consisted only of industrial companies, but
this is no longer the case. Of the original 12 companies, only General
Electric still exists. In 2018, this company, which was once the largest
in the world, was removed from the index. Procter & Gamble has now been
included in the Dow for the longest time - since 1932.

When the Dow Jones was created, the index was at a price of $40.94. This
was the average of the prices of the 12 shares, with each share counted
equally. In 1916, the index was expanded to 20 stocks. Since 1928, the
Dow has included 30 listed companies, which is why it is also referred
to as “Dow 30.”

The product code of Dow Jones Index is [#YM][1] according to the CME
stock exchange.

The Dow Jones is one of the few indices to use a price-weighted index.
This in contrast to, for example, the AEX. This means that a stock with
a high price can have a big impact on the index’s overall movement. In
other words: not every company is equally important and counts equally
for the stand of the fair. The Dow Jones index provides a good picture
of the economic situation in America.

The calculation of the final price of the index is even more
complicated: to also take stock splits and stock dividends into account,
the average is divided by the Dow Divisor, which is a number that
maintains the correctness of the index. This Dow Divisor is regularly
updated. This is to give an idea of [how to](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-trading-how-to/) analyze the Dow Jones
forecast.

## Factors That Can Impact the Dow Jones Stock Price

### Factor # 1 – Current News

First of all, we know that the price of the Dow Jones is calculated
using data from its companies. That is why it is important to keep a
close eye on all the major [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) and results of the companies that weigh
the most in this reference index.

### Factor # 2 –  U.S. Economic Data

The most important economic data published by the U.S. government is
also very important. Figures may include unemployment, trade balance,
GDP growth rate, inflation rate, retail sales, durable goods, and
industrial orders, business sentiment, or consumer confidence.

### Factor # 3 – U.S. Dollar Exchange Rate

The value of the U.S. dollar against other currencies is also a factor
that can affect the Dow Jones, as it will affect the export or import
profitability of U.S. listed companies. If the U.S. dollar is going
down, so is the stock index.

### Factor # 4 –  U.S. Federal Reserve Communications

Finally, we will also review communications from the U.S. Federal
Reserve on interest rates, as well as the press conferences of these
organizations.

## Dow Jones Predictions by Experts

1\. A volatile and unpredictable DJIA

Firstly, there are no such long-term predictions for the DJIA. The
market is too volatile to make such forecasts. Especially after the
Corona crisis, experts are afraid to make predictions. However, we found
a few.

2\. Wallet[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)

At Wallet[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/).com, [they predict][2] that if you are looking for
stocks with good returns, the Dow Jones Industrial Average can be a
profitable investment option. Dow Jones Industrial Average’s quote is
above 33,000 USD at 2021-03-18. Based on their forecasts, a long-term
increase is expected.

3\. Investinghaven

This Dow Jones forecast for 2021 is [strongly bullish][3]. At
Investinghaven, they expected the Dow Jones to hit 32,000 points in
early 2021. They forecast lots of volatility as the Dow Jones will be
testing the 34k area, presumably near the end of 2021 or in 2022.
Investors should get the maximum value out of the bullish potential from
this Dow Jones projection.

## Dow Jones Technical Analysis

First, let's identify [DJIA][1]'s global trends.

There’s a multi-year bullish trend marked as a blue solid line in Dow
Jones Industrial Average's monthly price chart. From March 2020, the
DJIA stock price has been moving faster, which is marked with a blue
dotted line in the chart above.

However, that's a false signal of bulls' growing strength as the sharp
upsurge is accompanied by a continuous fall in trading volumes. Such
divergence usually occurs amid short-term breakouts that precede a
reversal.

### DJIA Forecast For Next Three Months

Let's find other signals using MACD and RSI indicators and make a
realistic forecast for the next three months.

On [DJIA][1]'s weekly time frame, the RSI chart came close to the
resistance level formed by the previous maximum in January 2020. The
MACD produced indirect signals of a correction start as well: the
indicator's histogram moved to the red zone, and the MACD line is trying
to consolidate underneath the signal line.

Combined with the technical analysis of the monthly time frame chart,
those signals let us suggest that the DJIA future price may undergo a
bearish correction with a target of 19,500 points and approach the trend
line. Nevertheless, I recommend going short only after the DJIA price
chart crosses the dotted trend line and consolidates below.

In an alternative scenario, an upward price movement will continue. It
won't most likely be long as the bullish potential is weak amid buyers'
low activity.

### Long-Term DJIA Technical Analysis for 2021

Let's do technical analysis of the DJIA price [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) in the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time
frame chart and make a detailed forecast for 2021.

The DJIA projected stock price will most likely fluctuate between 35,000
and 19,500 US dollars per lot for the rest of the year.

The projected price fall will most likely start in July as the Dow Jones
index's bullish potential is almost exhausted. This fall is expected to
be short-term but fast, as it was during the correction in February and
March 2020. So, the DJIA stock price should be expected to have come
close to the trend line at the level of 19,500 USD by October. The chart
may then pull back and continue moving upwards, following a global
bullish trend. The DJIA index is expected to reach the value of 23,125 -
27,000 USD by the end of the year.

The table below presents an expected DJIA trading range for each month
of 2021.

## Long Term Dow Jones Forecast 2025-2030*

While some [advisor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/expert-advisor/)s are optimistic that the bull market will continue,
others are preparing [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s for what they see as its imminent end. As
the current bull is now the second-longest ever, these [advisor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/expert-advisor/)s say that
the odds are overwhelming that it will soon be going bearish.

However, Dave S. Gilreath, partner and founder of Sheaff Brock
Investment Advisors, is [very confident][5] and sees a bright economic
and other market future ahead. He believes the current bull is likely to
continue galloping for years to come, pushing the Dow Jones Industrial
Average above 40,000 by 2025.

Companies typically grow their earnings over time. Assuming an average
growth of net earnings is 7% per year, we can compute that in a five-
year period of time, a company’s cumulative profits will be about $40
for every $100 invested.

Reasoning onward, using a mathematical forecasting model, we can dig up
more interesting results. The year 2020 marks where this math equation
took us above 30,000. In 2030, projections and trends show that the Dow
would reach 50,000, [says][6] Brian Evans - the owner of Madrona Funds,
LLC and [Bauer Evans CPAs][7], who also serves as the firms’ chief
investment officer, lead planner, and senior portfolio manager. He was
honored to ring the bell on the NYSE.

## How Did the Price of Dow Jones Change Over Time?

 _Source: Macrotrends.net_

Is the Dow Jones Industrial Index price expected to rise? We can’t
predict with certainty what the price of DJI will be in the next 10
years, but we can look back at the Dow Jones [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) trends. This can
help us make more reliable index predictions. The above chart is a
[historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) price chart that shows how the price of the DJIA changed over
the past 10 years:

## What Is the Future of Dow Jones? Is Dow Jones Still a Profitable
Investment?

In recent years, the Dow Jones price has risen enormously, as can be
seen in the above tables. The Dow Jones rate has been tracked since
1896, and in 1976, the 1000-point limit was broken. Subsequently, the
limit of 20,000 points was reached in 2017, and the Dow Jones price is
now already at more than 30,000 points.

Nevertheless, the question remains where the limit lies for the Dow
Jones index. What has become clear is that the Dow Jones price has
become much more volatile, with [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) fluctuations of hundreds of points
being no exception. Below is a Dow Jones price prediction chart for
