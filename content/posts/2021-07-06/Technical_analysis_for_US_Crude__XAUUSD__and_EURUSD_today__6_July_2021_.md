Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 06.07.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

Yesterday, within a short-term uptrend, an oil buy pattern was formed.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

Yesterday, within a short-term uptrend, an oil buy pattern was formed
(see screenshot). As a result, the pattern yielded profits and the Gold
Zone 75.03 - 74.76 was broken out. The next growth target is the Target
Zone 3 77.94 - 77.41.

I recommend considering new oil purchases on correction at strong
support levels: Micro-zone 75.52 - 75.46 and Additional Zone 74.86 -
74.73. A pattern is required for purchases.

The trend border is shifted to level 74.24.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

  1. Buy according to the pattern in Micro-zone 75.52 - 75.46. TakeProfit: 76.15. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. Buy according to the pattern in Additional Zone 74.86 - 74.73. TakeProfit: 76.15. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

The short-term gold uptrend continues with the target in the Gold Zone
1820 - 1818. Now traders are trying to break out the Target Zone 1800 -
1795 and consolidate the price higher.

It is reasonable to look for new gold purchases on corrections at strong
support levels according to the patterns. The nearest supports for
today: Additional Zone 1795 - 1794 and Intermediary Zone 1784 - 1781.
The latter also acts as the trend key support.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

  1. Buy according to the pattern in Additional Zone 1795 - 1794. TakeProfit: 1806. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. Buy according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 1784 - 1781. TakeProfit: 1806. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

The euro/dollar pair has reached the key resistance zone 1.1904 - 1.1878
as part of the correction to the short-term downtrend. Now expect a sell
pattern formation to enter a short trade with the target at the lower
Target Zone 1.1800 - 1.1781. A breakout of today's low and price
consolidation below is required for the pattern formation.

Alternative buy scenario: a breakout of level 1.1904 will cause the
trend reversal up. In this case, starting from the next trading session,
it will be possible to start looking for purchases at strong support
levels with a target at the upper Target Zone 1.2000 - 1.1983.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

Open sell positions according to the pattern in 1.1904 - 1.1878.
TakeProfit: Target Zone 1.1800 - 1.1781. StopLoss: according to the
pattern rules.
