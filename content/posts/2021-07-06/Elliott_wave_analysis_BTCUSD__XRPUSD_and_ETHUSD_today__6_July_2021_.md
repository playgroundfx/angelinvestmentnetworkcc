Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 06.07.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

The leading diagonals continue developing, so long positions are still
relevant.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

The BTCUSD market has completed the impulse down wave [A]. Next, the
market has turned up and started rising. There could be unfolding the
ascending wave (A) as a leading diagonal. Its sub-waves 1 and 3 are
bullish impulses, sub-waves 2 and 4 are zigzag-shaped corrections.
Correction 4 finished further than impulse 1. There is developing the
upward wave 5 as an ending diagonal, as sub-wave [4] finished lower than
sub-wave [1]. The Bitcoin price should be moving in sub-wave [5] up to a
level of 38100.00.

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

The XRPUSD market is forming a new bullish zigzag A-B-C. There is
developing the first leg of this zigzag, wave A. Wave A should be
unfolding as a leading diagonal [1]-[2]-[3]-[4]-[5]. The first four
parts of the diagonal have completed and there is forming the final
fifth leg. The Ripple price should be rising in sub-wave [5] to a level
of 0.760. One could enter long trades in the current situation.
