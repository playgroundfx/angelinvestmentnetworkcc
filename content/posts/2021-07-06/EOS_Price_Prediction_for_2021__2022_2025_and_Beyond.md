EOS Price Prediction for 2021, 2022-2025 and BeyondJana Kane

EOS is a decentralized system based on [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) technology. Its main
aim is to enable the development, hosting, and execution of commercial-
scale decentralized applications. The cryptocurrency supports secure
access, data hosting, and the connection between the dApps and the
Internet.

The main competitor of EOS is Ethereum, and right now, ETH is more
popular than EOS. But it doesn't stop experts from considering EOS as a
currency with great potential because of its special features. For
example, EOS focuses on critical pain points of [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/), like speed,
scalability, and flexibility.

What’s more, EOS tries to solve the problems of limited availability of
resources on the network, false transactions, similar requests, spamming
apps, and some more. 700 million tokens are being distributed on an
ongoing basis of 2 million per day for 350 days. What does the future
hold for those who are full of hope that EOS will increase? Let’s find
out about EOS and [crypto trading][1].

The article covers the following subjects:

This article will answer the most frequently asked questions about EOS,
cover its [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/), and show you EOS price predictions from the crypto
industry experts, as well as long-term forecasts of the coin. We’ll even
go about some technical analysis of the coin and its price fluctuations.

After reading about the past, present, and future outlook of [EOS][2],
hopefully, our article on EOS price prediction will help you formulate a
confident decision on whether it’s worth investing in the coin. Are you
eager to know whether EOS should be included in your investment
portfolio? Read on to learn about all the important aspects.

## What is EOS Crypto?

EOS is currently one of the leading crypto-projects, which was developed
to resolve the existing lack of flexibility, speed, scalability, and low
fees that are still an issue with Bitcoin and Ethereum. EOS operates on
its own [smart contract](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/smart-contract-on-blockchain/) platform for decentralized applications (dApps):
the EOS.IO [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) protocol, designed especially as a solution to
outperform regular processing and hardware storage, and much more
interesting stuff.

Back in 2017, EOS developers Brendan Blumer and Dan Larimer publicly
released their whitepaper, and the first EOS initial coin offering (ICO)
launched in June of the same year. It lasted an entire year and raised a
whopping $4.1 billion – breaking all ICO records at the time.

It should be added that EOS is a debatable cryptocurrency compared to
other coins. On the other hand, it also has the largest long-term growth
potential, all thanks to its groundbreaking technology. The EOS
[blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) protocol can potentially transform the future of all Apps and
computer resources drastically, in case it does refine the internal
processes in various industries, as promised by EOS’ developers. If so,
the coin’s long-term price will rise rapidly.

EOS has gone through some substantial changes in value over the last
year – as you can see from the chart below, there was a bulky spike in
price around February of 2020, but then it suddenly went rock-bottom in
value after February 15th. Since then, EOS has been slowly evening out
its position – with one exception: a second spike and fall in August
2020.

## EOS Price Predictions for 2021 by Crypto Experts

WIth EOS going rapidly up and down, it’s hard to plan your next move
correctly. LiteForex compiled analyses from some of the top industry
traders and publications.

Overall, experts from Trading Beasts suppose that EOS will grow
extremely slowly in 2021, but they expect no sudden downfalls. The
average price in August is going to be $3.65910. In October, EOS is
believed to cost, on average, $3.72266. In December, the world will see
EOS cost $3.79319. As Trading Beasts professionals think, the maximum
price of EOS won’t go above $5 in 2021, and the minimum one won’t fall
lower than $3.

Wallet Investor expects EOS to fall dramatically and reach $1.795 by the
end of August. The downtrend will continue till the middle of September.
Then, EOS is expected to rise from the minimum amount of $1.090 to
$1.386 at the beginning of October. The whole October, the average price
is going to stay within $0.9880-$1.399. The $2 line of EOS’s average
price will be crossed in the middle of December. On the last day of
2021, EOS will have a price of $2.932.

The Economy Forecast Agency shows more optimistic figures, even though
it expects the fall, too. July is going to end on a high note of $3.40.
The last day of summer will bring the lower price of $2.86. The end of
September and October show sad results as well - $2.40 and $2.47,
respectively. November will show growth up to $2.87, and the year 2021
will leave us with $3.36.

EOS will hit $5 by the end of 2021. The figures show stable growth from
$4.53 in August, $5.41 in October, and finally, $6.51 at the end of the
year.

## EOS Technical Analysis

I will start the [EOSUSD][2] technical analysis by exploring the EOS
rate [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) data in the longest timeframe.

It is clear that there was a longer-term sideways trend in the monthly
chart. The latest candlestick suggests that there could start a new
trend.

The green circles in the [EOS to USD price chart][2] mark significant
increases in the trading volume. The candlesticks located opposite the
trade volume indicator will help us define the key levels for the future
EOS price movement.

For example, level 5.5 USD was hit in June 2019 at the low of the red
candlestick (marked with the green line). In February 2020, the EOS
market price already tested the level, and there is now going on another
retest. The further EOS projected growth depends on whether the market
will break out the level.

Another green level marks a relevant local high at 8.6 dollars. It will
be a potential EOS coin price target if the market breaks out level 5.5
USD.

The support level is at a level of around 1.5, marked with a red line.
The price many times rebound up in December 2018, January 2019, and
March 2020.

Another important level is at 2.2 USD. Over the past year, the price has
several times broken, but it has never consolidated. Levels 1.5 and 2.2
form a support zone, marked with the red area in the chart.

### EOS price prediction for next three months

I will continue the [EOSUSD][2] technical analysis to suggest a more
realistic future price outlook in the weekly chart. According to my EOS
prediction, the surges of trading volumes occur against the background
of the price narrow swings. It means the active struggle between bulls
and bears.

Besides, the EOS price rebound from level 5.5 means a likely side-ways
trend should start soon. Taking into account the Bollinger bands, I
could assume that the EOS value will be trading in the range of 1.6-4.5
over the next three months.

Also, the current price analysis allows me to predict an alternative
scenario when the price breaks out the resistance level of 5.5. If so,
the expected EOS price growth target will be a level of 8.5 USD.

However, the EOSUSD trade volume does not confirm the latter scenario.
Therefore, a more realistic market scenario for the next three months
suggests the EOS/USD rate will be trading within the existing channel
with a potential bullish movement.

### Monthly EOS price forecast for 2021

Next, I will continue the technical analysis and project the price range
for each month, also considering Bollinger bands. Below, I offer a
detailed long term EOS [cryptocurrency price](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/cryptocurrency-price/) forecast for 2021.

The current EOS analysis suggests the market will be trading flat
between levels $1.5-$2.2 and $5.5. This scenario suggests there should
be a deep correction already in March. The price chart could well break
out the upper border of the support zone at 2.2 and reach the level of
1.5.

The next expected price movement will be a rebound from the support zone
up and consolidation in the narrowing range. I suppose the[ EOS USD][2]
price will be trading in the range of 2.9–4.4 in October 2021. Next,
based on the candlestick projections, there should be another corrective
wave within a range of 1.7–3.2. If the price breaks out at key levels,
it will signal an emerging trend. This scenario will be canceled if the
market breaks out at level 5.5 USD. If so, the likely EOS price target
will be at 8.5 USD.

 The detailed [EOS][2] forecast for each month is in the table below.

The [EOSUSD][2] price technical analysis is presented by[ Mikhail

## Weekly Elliott wave EOS analysis as of 05.07.2021

The EOSUSD market is forming a long-term double zigzag. The [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/)
timeframe displays the final part of the first motive wave (W). There is
unfolding the descending wave (X) as a double zigzag W-X-Y. The first
two sub-waves have completed, and the final motive wave Y is still
developing. The Y wave should complete as a double zigzag, like waves W
and X. Let us study the chart in more detail in the H8 timeframe.

The bearish wave (A) has completed as a five-wave impulse within the new
descending zigzag. Next, the price has started rising. There could be
developing the upward corrective wave (B). It is difficult to predict
the exact structure of the (B) wave, but we could expect it to end at a
level of 7.50, where wave (B) will be 38.2% of wave (A). It is a common
ratio in zigzags. Therefore, one could enter purchases in the current
situation.

## EOS Price Prediction Chart 2022

The EOS trend of going up and down in cycles will remain in 2022. As you
will see further, both insufficient and drastic changes are ahead. The
biggest growth is expected by Coin Price Forecast. Their experts are
sure that EOS will meet the2023 with the result of $11.69. Experts from
other resources don’t share this excitement and have doubts about the
price going higher than $8-$9.

January 2022 will begin with an average price of $3.83165. By June, the
price is believed to go up a little bit - it will become $4.04283.
Stable yet slow progress is expected till the end of 2022. The last
month will leave us with an average price of $4.34466. The maximum price
in 2022 will be $5.43083. Trading Beasts doesn’t expect EOS to fall
under $3.25690 in July.

The first day of 2022 will congratulate us with $3.075. Until March, we
expect some insignificant ups and downs. At the beginning of March, the
average price will be $3.482. A downtrend that leads us under the $2
mark is expected next. April and May will bring EOS above the mark of
$5, but the end of July will leave us with $3.462. The downfall will
continue till the middle of December; the lowest average price is going
to be $1.386. The 31st of December will bring us $3.329.

As you can see, the Economy Forecast Agency shows the most optimistic
angle of the EOS price in 2022. The year will start with $3.46. June
will end with the result of $5.94. Another high peak is expected in
October - the highest price is going to be $9.06. The year 2022 will end
with $6.50.

In the first half of 2022, the EOS price will climb to $8.99; in the
second half, the price would add $2.70 and close the year at $11.69.

## EOS Price Prediction for 2023 by Crypto Experts

2023 won’t show stable growth. Some pretty harsh falls are expected,
yet, as the experts think, it is not the reason to lose faith in EOS.

According to the EOS forecast, The average price in January 2023 is
$3.73987. By July, it is going to rise just a bit - July will bring
$4.02840. December will leave us with $4.28563. No huge falls are
expected in 2023.

January 2023, according to Wallet Investor, will start with $3.242. The
price will continue rising with small falls by the end of February. It
will reach $4.165. Then we will see a downtrend in March with the lowest
average price of $2.888. The first days of July will bring us $4.262.
September will show a strong decline of $1.746. The end of December’s
average price is $3.497.

performance in 2023.

The price in 2023 will have great volatility. We can see a little fall
from January’s result of $6.50 (the opening price) to the end of July’s
result of the closing price of $5.14. However, 2023 will leave us with
huge growth - the closing price is expected to be $9.54 in December.

EOS will start 2023 at $11.69, then soar to $14.32 within the first six
months of the year and finish 2023 at $16.90.

## Long Term EOS Price Prediction 2025-2030



Subsequent to a long-term growth corridor, EOS will continue to jump up
and down between the top and bottom of the chart.

Trading Beasts did not want to look so far into the future. Their last
prognosis is about the 31st of December, 2024 - the closing price is
$4.91569.

January 2025 will begin with $4.005. May will bring a high point of
$8.273. Despite this fact, by the end of June, EOS will fall to $4.888.
December 2025 will leave us with an average price of $4.258. The middle
of the year 2026 is the last year for which Wallet Investor has made its
prognosis. It will begin with $4.327. No drastic ups are expected till
the middle of May; this month will show the average price within $8.225
- $9.289.  The end of June will bring us the price of $5.585.

2025 will show the opening price of $5.43 on the 1st of January. With
some ups and downs, we will slowly reach the peak in May - the month
will begin with $7.12. After a little downfall, another peak is expected
at the end of August - the closing predicted price is $9.78. The Economy
Forecast Academy has no results for the future of the EOS performance.

The Coin Price Forecast is the most optimistic about the future.
According to their experts, 2025 will start at  $19.90. The middle of
2025 will begin with $20.42. After a downtrend in 2027, when the middle
of the year will bring $19.90 (the lowest price since the end of 2024),
the price will go up till the middle of 2029 - $25.77. The end of 2029,
however, will bring us $23.36. The middle of 2030 will show the result
of $24.14. The price will go down a little by the end of the year. The
closing price of 2030 is expected to be $25.28.

### EOS: A Viable Long-Term Investment?

Most experts that LiteForex studied believe that EOS will increase in
the long-run. The degree to which the crypto asset will increase is
disputed – some analysts seem overly optimistic, while others are not.

Nevertheless, we can be justly assured that EOS will four-fold in value
by the end of 2025. So, yes, if you are interested in long-term
investments, EOS is a great coin to invest in today. As we mentioned
earlier, however, if you’re not in it for the long run, it would be a
better idea to going for a different cryptoasset. Again, all long-term
forecasts are very approximate and can be influenced by [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/), political
and economic [regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/)s, and other factors.

## EOS Today and in History: How Has the Price of EOS Changed Over Time?

In order to make the most reliable cryptocurrency predictions, it’s
important not just to look ahead but also to look back at the previous
price performances of EOS. Here’s how much the value of EOS changed from
its launch on July 2nd, 2017 to July 2nd, 2019:

 _Source: CoinMarketCup_

The first whitepaper of EOS was established in 2017. The open-source
software was released on the 1st of June, 2018. It was thought to be the
most highly anticipated [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) project of all time. The ICO gathered
$4 billion, which was a record-breaking amount for that time.

Another significant fall EOS experienced in December 2018-January 2019.
The price was $1.93, while the highest one before had reached more than
$8. The drop in user activity in EOS could be linked to the EIDOS
airdrop that significantly slowed down the network.

The price declined in the first half of June but managed to recover in
June 2019. EOS reached $8.62. Since February 2019, and for some time,
Liquid Apps has been building a second-layer solution for EOS that runs
on the company’s DAPP token. Liquid Apps’ solution aimed to take some
pressure off the EOS [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/)’s RAM system, which had bogged down.

From July 2019 to January 2020, the performance of EOS wasn’t very
lively and joyful. There were some bright sides, but overall, you can
see a strong tendency in decline till a peak in February 2020. The price
of EOS was $5.36 then. Though it didn’t repeat the previous success, it
looked quite good and promising given the [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) of the six months
before. The reason for such good [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) was the general tendency of
growing in the cryptocurrency world due to the rise of Bitcoin.
Moreover, in January 2020, the second version of the platform - EOSIO 2
- was launched.

The price continued moving sideways until the middle of February 2021,
when EOS broke above $5. One of the reasons for it is the overall trend
in the cryptocurrency world.

On the 11th of March, 2021, the PowerUp Model of EOS was shown to the
world. It helped to raise the price of the cryptocurrency by 4.75%
during the first three hours. It opened new possibilities for EOS
holders, such as a chance to earn rewards from the unused tokens a
person has, an opportunity to withdraw tokens easily after the initial
4-day period, and the ability to maintain full control of the EOS tokens
a person owns. Fees were lowered as well.

Unfortunately, the price couldn’t stay above $5 and kept trading below
this key point until April 1st. This sudden fall can be explained by the
“boom-and-bust” cycle. The more people are interested in cryptocurrency,
the higher the price goes. When some doubts and disillusionment creep
in, a sudden crush happens.

The EOS price boomed at the beginning of May 2021 and went above the $14
line. The reason was the [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) that its founding company secured 10
billion USD for the launch of a brand new subsidiary called Bullish
Global. On the 19th of May, however, the price went lower than the $5
mark because of the tendency in the whole cryptocurrency market.

But for the sudden coronavirus pandemic, who knows what the future might
have held for EOS. In March 2020, the price fell to $2.01. The rest of
2020 went quite smoothly - EOS was fighting for its life.

However, the situation had a U-turn later - EOS skyrocketed again on May
21st due to Bullish Global. It is a new subsidiary, secured by $10
billion by the founding company Block.one.

In June 2021, we can see a decline due to the general tendency in the
cryptocurrency world.

How high will EOS go after? We can only assume.

### What is the Future of EOS? Is EOS a good investment? Will EOS go up?

Should I invest in EOS? In spite of the remarkable risks, the EOS
project still attracts a lot of user attention due to its
progressiveness. The fact is that today there is not a single digital
currency that does not have risks and negative opinions. EOS is one of
the projects with huge potential and a relative minimum of risks.

Summing up the analysis of the [EOS][2] cryptocurrency project, you may
be surprised by how many dramatic ups and downs it has had during its
[history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/).

Even though EOS stayed relatively stable over the last few years, there
was a time when it fell a full 93%, erasing most of the gains of early
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s. As some experts think, EOS is about to set a new all-time
