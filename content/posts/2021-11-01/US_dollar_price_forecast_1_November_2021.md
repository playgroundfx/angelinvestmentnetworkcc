Dollar is stronger than euro. Forecast as of 01.11.2021Dmitri Demidenko

To succeed in trading, one should understand which factors have been
priced and which are yet to be priced in the foreign exchange rates. A
typical example of how the principle “buy the [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/), sell the facts” was
the last day of October. Let us discuss the Forex outlook and make up a
[EURUSD][1] trading plan.

## Weekly US dollar fundamental forecast

The euro seems weaker than the dollar, as one can see from the
[EURUSD][1] price chart. The euro bulls failed, although the euro-area
economic expansion was stronger than the US in the third quarter, and
the euro-area inflation hit 4%, which has been only the second time in
[history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/). The major currency pair has dropped to its 16-month low amid
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s’ concerns about a longer high prices pressure than the Fed
claims.

Compared to the euro-area GDP growth of 9.1% Y-o-Y in July-September,
+2% for the US economy looks rather weak. The euro-area economy won
thanks to a better epidemiological environment, growth in business and
consumer activity after the lifting of lockdowns, showing more expansion
in the third quarter than in the second of +2.2% Q-o-Q. However, the
energy crisis will surely press down the euro-area growth in October-
December; its economy still has not fully recovered from the recession,
while the US will begin to benefit from the decline in the number of
COVID-19 cases.

Moreover, the euro-area inflation hit 4%, while Bloomberg experts
predicted 3.7%, which should have encouraged the ECB to take active
steps. However, Christine Lagarde and her colleagues remain passive,
accusing the markets of incorrect pricing.

Thus, the euro area featured strong GDP and consumer prices reports, but
the [EURUSD][1] bulls didn’t go ahead. What’s the reason? Markets are
known to grow on expectations, and the factor of strong domestic data
was priced in the euro-dollar quotes. Following the actual data release,
expectations shifted to US inflation, employment, and the Fed meeting.

In September, the personal consumption expenditure index rose 4.4%, the
highest level since 1991. At the same time, civilian wages in the United
States jumped by 1.5%. This is the greatest increase in the data series
since 2001. Investors immediately remembered the 1960s, when the Fed
thought it could control the hot labour market without increasing
inflation. The US central bank was wrong then and may again make the
same mistake. For example, Goldman Sachs believes that consumer prices
in the United States will stay above 4%, even when the Fed finishes its
quantitative easing program. This gives the bank reason to shift the
first federal funds rate hike forecast from 2023 to July 2022.

### Weekly [EURUSD][1] trading plan

Strong data on US inflation and wages increased the chance of the first
Fed’s rate hike in the middle of next year from 77% to 90%, although a
month ago it was 15%. It is not surprising that against such a
background, coupled with the expectations of the FOMC hawkish tone and
strong US jobs report in October, the [EURUSD][1] hasn’t consolidated
above 1.168, as expected, and has dropped. Considering the strong
economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the dollar, the euro should continue falling
towards $1.149 and $1.145. Hold short trades and add up to them from
time to time.
