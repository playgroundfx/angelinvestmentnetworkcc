Yen's future is not so bright. Forecast as of 01.11.2021Dmitri Demidenko

Divergences in economic growth and monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the Fed and the
Bank of Japan are not the only drivers of [USDJPY][1] growth. The status
of the safe-haven asset and the funding currency is putting pressure on
the yen. Let us discuss the Forex outlook and make up a trading plan.

## Monthly Japanese yen fundamental forecast

The fact that Fumio Kishida's Liberal Democratic Party, contrary to
expectations, won a strong majority in the parliamentary elections did
not support the [USDJPY][1] bears. As a rule, the decrease in political
uncertainty plays into the hands of the national currency, but the
Japanese yen was so weak in October that it was once again sold off as a
safe haven asset.

The yen has a lot of problems with its status as a funding currency.
Over the past two months, the Bloomberg Cumulative FX Carry Trade Index,
which tracks the profits of the three top-performing G10 currencies
versus the three lowest, has risen by 3.6%. Since the beginning of the
year, the index has grown by 8%, which is the best dynamics since 2016.
Obviously, the Japanese yen was among the outsiders.

The reason for such success of competitors is rumors about the monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) normalization. So far, the Bank of Japan cannot even dream of
this. At its most recent meeting, the BoJ lowered its 2021 inflation
forecast from 0.6% to 0%, suggesting its long-term commitment to
monetary expansion. According to Haruhiko Kuroda, there is a small
chance that consumer prices in Japan will accelerate as Tokyo maintains
its stimulus and other central banks cut it. According to the BoJ head,
the weakening of the yen had a positive effect on the economy.

BoJ lowered forecasts not only for inflation but also for GDP. It should
be noted that according to Bloomberg experts surveys, the Japanese
economy will expand the slowest among the G7 countries.

Thus, the decrease of political uncertainty, the sell-off of funding
currencies as part of the growing interest in carry trade, divergence in
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) and economic growth, suggest that the upward [USDJPY][2]
trend is stable. The pair continues to rise even amid a pullback in
10-year US Treasury yields. Rates on 2-year securities sensitive to the
Fed's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) continue to rise. This is because the derivatives
market expects the first increase in the federal funds rate by July 2022
with a probability of 77% and by September 2022 with a probability of
89%. A month ago, the figures were 15% and 27%, respectively.

### Monthly [USDJPY][2] trading plan

In my opinion, the yen's failures in 2021 are nothing compared to what
will happen next year. According to Goldman Sachs, inflation in the US
will grow by 4% or more even by the end of the QE. Amid an improvement
in the epidemiological situation, the labor market will be able to
recover faster than expected, which will push the Fed towards aggressive
monetary restriction. As a result, the US dollar will continue to
strengthen against currencies whose issuing central banks adhere to
ultra-easy monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). This circumstance allows continuing
[USDJPY][2] purchases with targets at 115.5 and 117. Hold and add up to
long trades entered on correction at [levels 113.2 and 113.8][3].
