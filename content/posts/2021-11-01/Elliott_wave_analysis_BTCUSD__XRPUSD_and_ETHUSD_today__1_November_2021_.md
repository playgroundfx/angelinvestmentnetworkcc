Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 01.11.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

The BTCUSD market could be forming a corrective wave as a bearish triple
zigzag. The ETHUSD is forming an expanding horizontal triangle, upon
completion of which, the price should start rising in the new impulse.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

The BTCUSD market is forming the (C) wave, which is the final leg of the
large corrective wave [B]. There could be developing the final element
of the bearish correction 4, which is about to end soon. This correction
is unfolding as a triple zigzag [W]-[X]-[Y]-[X]-[Z]. The price should be
declining in the (C) impulse to a level of 57239.05, where motive wave
[Y] finished earlier. At the indicated level, wave [Z] will be 76.4% of
the [W] wave. After the price reaches level 57239.05, it could start
rising as outlined in the chart.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Sell 60249.50, TP 57239.05

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

The XRPUSD market is forming the linking upwave X as a triple zigzag
[W]-[X]-[Y]-[X]-[Z]. The linking wave [X] has recently completed as a
double zigzag (W)-(X)-(Y). There is now developing the final motive wave
[Z], which should have a simple structure composed of sub-waves
(A)-(B)-(C). A short descending correction (B) should soon end, and the
price will start rising in the (C) impulse to a level of 1.157, marked
by correction B.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] **** today:

Buy 1.085, TP 1.157

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

The ETHUSD market is forming the second half of the large impulse wave
[C] composed of sub-waves (1)-(2)-(3)-(4)-(5). There should be forming a
horizontal corrective wave, unfolding as an expanding triangle
A-B-C-D-E. The first four parts of the triangle pattern must have
completed. Over the next few days, the market should be declining in the
final impulse sub-wave [C] to a level of 3882.00, the support level
marked by the zigzag-shaped wave C.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Sell 4228.94, TP 3882.00
