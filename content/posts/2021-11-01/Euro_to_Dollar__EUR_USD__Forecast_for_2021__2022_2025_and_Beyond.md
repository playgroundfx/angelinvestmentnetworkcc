EUR/USD Forecast: A Weaker Dollar in 2021 Makes SenseJana Kane

Based on the knowledge that [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s have at a given moment, they
always make prices with a certain expectation about the future. For
example, currency rates are the macroeconomic prospects of a country or
region, and the price paid for shares usually implies an expectation
about future earnings and sales development.

Professional market parties closely follow the financial [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) and
continuously process new information, including economic forecasts and
other expectations. Based on this, the market arrives at an average
expectation for a share or currency pair's price development. In our
case – the dollar versus euro.

Specifically, they are subject to (measurable) underlying interest rate
differences, inflation, unemployment figures, trade, and capital flow
for exchange rates. Simultaneously, a large part of the pricing is also
related to 'event' risks that cannot be gauged in advance and changing
market sentiment. Let’s go more in-depth in this Euro to Dollar
forecast.

The article covers the following subjects:

## History of the EUR/USD Pair

The Euro (EUR) is a fairly young currency that was born in 1999. The
single European currency has replaced a whole galaxy of the EU
countries' national currencies: The Deutsche mark, the French franc, the
Italian lira, and others. Therefore, one of the euro's features is its
susceptibility to macroeconomic statistics of the entire Eurozone and
individual EU countries' indicators.

The European currency was officially introduced into non-cash
circulation on January 1, 1999, and on January 1, 2002, banknotes and
coins were introduced into cash circulation. In [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of the volume of
use in international payments, the euro is second only to the US dollar.
It is also the second most popular (after USD) reserve world currency.
At the time of the official start of trading, the EUR/USD rate was in
the 1.1800 area.

Since the beginning of trading in 1999, the [EUR/USD][1] pair has
undergone significant changes. In the first two years, the euro's
prospects were still vague, and the quotation was declining, reaching a
minimum of around 0.8200. The pair then rallied for seven years,
reaching an all-time high of 1.6000 in 2008. In subsequent years, due to
the banking crisis's influence and various problems in the Eurozone, the
pair corrected significantly.

To check how has the rate of EUR/USD changed over time and EUR/USD
current price, please follow [this link to the extended [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) price
chart][1].

## Sharp Moves of the Dollar in 2020

In [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of market sentiment, 2020 has been a very illustrative year.
During the first coronavirus wave in March, the market was unpleasantly
surprised by the severity, magnitude, and impact of the coronavirus
pandemic, causing [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s to flee to the dollar as a safe haven.

Initially, the coronavirus was thought to be "a Chinese problem only."
Still, as the virus began to spread faster worldwide - locking up
economies around the world - the dollar exchange rate was reca[Libra](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/libra-creator/)ted
in no time.

A similar revision took place three months ago but in the opposite
direction. When pharmaceutical company Pfizer released positive vaccine
[news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) in early November, the dollar fell in value due to the
disappearance of the need for a safe haven.

In both cases, the market reaction was apparent, but that is not always
the case. Take the announced financial support packages from the
European Central Bank (ECB) this year. Whereas in the past, the
availability of more euros often caused downward pressure on the euro,
such packages resulted in an upward price movement this year.

Coronavirus support was "suddenly" perceived as positive by the market.
According to [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s, the ECB showed it was doing everything it could
to prevent companies from collapsing and safeguard employees' jobs.

Precisely because of the occurrence of unforeseen market conditions and
the sometimes-surprising market reaction to them, our starting point is
that you should always take price estimates with a grain.

For example, at the end of 2018, many market parties anticipated a
weaker dollar, but in 2019 the dollar picked up with the US-Chinese
trade war as a catalyst. That created a lot of uncertainty, causing
capital to flow to safe havens like the dollar. Such events are
difficult to envision, and this was especially true in recent years with
a fickle character like Donald Trump at the helm in the United States.

## EUR/USD Current Rate

The current rate of the EUR/USD pair is $1.16040. Below, you can see an
interactive chart from Forex in real-time:

## Characteristic Features of the EUR/USD Pair

The [EUR/USD][1] pair belongs to the major currency pairs (majors) and
is characterized by increased liquidity. This is not surprising, as it
includes two of the world's major reserve currencies: USD and EUR. It is
in the euro/dollar that the largest volume of transactions is made
during [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) trading on the Forex market (approximately 20% of the total
volume).

The behavior of the EUR/USD pair is a kind of indicator showing the
comparative state of the US and EU economies. If the US economy is
growing steadily, and problems arise in the EU, EUR, this might cause a
EURO to US dollar fall. Conversely, if there is a decline in growth
rates in the US and the Eurozone demonstrates good performance, the
EUR/USD pair will grow. Let's consider the main trading characteristics
of this pair:

  * Active trading hours - the pair is traded around the clock except for weekends. It is most active during the European and American trading sessions. It is at this time that the largest trading volumes take place, and the main movements of the EUR/USD pair take place.
  * Volatility - the EUR/USD pair is characterized by medium volatility. During the release of important data, the pair is capable of making strong movements from 100 points and above. But in general, if you look at the [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) data, the average [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) volatility of the EUR/USD pair is about 80 pips.
  * Spread is one of the main advantages of this pair. Due to the highest liquidity, the spread for the EUR/USD pair is minimal. On popular ECN accounts, the spread is usually less than 1 pip.

## The Dollar in 2021: More Predictable?

Perhaps the direction of the dollar will become a little easier to
predict under President Biden. First of all, financial markets are
counting on the new US president to run less internationally and deal
more diplomatically with trade disputes. This provides more peace and
security in the financial markets, reducing the need for a haven such as
the dollar.

Also, Biden is expected to spend (a lot) of money to continue to
stimulate the US economy, including post-corona, which will further
increase the US's debt position. The fact that interest rates will
remain low for a longer period also plays a role: at the most recent
meeting of the Federal Reserve, Chairman Jerome Powell hinted that he
would not have an interest rate hike until mid-2023.

All of this leads to an estimate that capital flows towards emerging
markets and currencies will continue to flow at the US dollar expense.
Countries such as Indonesia and Mexico have aggressively lowered their
interest rates, but interest rates in these countries are still
considerably higher than in the United States.

Besides, countries such as China, South Korea, and Taiwan have had the
coronavirus outbreak reasonably under control for some time now. In
combination with optimism about the arrival of COVID vaccines, this
means that [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are, in any case, moving to more risky markets.

## EURUSD Technical Analysis

To determine global trends and key levels, we'll do a technical analysis
of the biggest time frame for the [EURUSD][1].



We saw a stable bearish trend on the EUR to USD monthly price chart for
over ten years. Then, the pair has been consolidating in the form of a
triangle since the beginning of 2017.

The [EURUSD][1]'s expected trading range will be located within the
triangle marked with purple lines in the coming years. So, our further
forecast will be based on the assumption that the price won't break the
pattern's upper and lower limits in the medium term.

If it does, we'll have a clear signal of the beginning of a trend
movement. The lower limit's breakout will continue the bearish trend
while the upper limit's one will point to the euro's significant bullish
potential.

### EURUSD price prediction for next three months

To predict the price movement in the next three months, we'll conduct a
technical analysis of the EURUSD's weekly chart.



EURUSD quotes reached the triangle's upper edge and the trend line at
the end of 2020. So, the future price isn't likely to grow. MACD and RSI
indicators point indirectly to an eventual reversal.

Similar values, displayed as two peaks, were observed during the last
rise in 2017 — 2018. Not only the curves but also the histograms look
identical.

The euro's projected value will most probably range from the previous
local minimum at 1.17 USD (red line) to the triangle's upper edge at
1.23 USD.

The [EUR to USD][1]'s reversal will be fully confirmed once the chart
has updated the previous local minimum and fallen below the red line.

In an alternative scenario, the euro may cross the trend line and break
upwards amid a solid bullish potential. In that case, the previous
significant maximum at 1.234 US dollars (green line) will be a price
target. If the price chart consolidates above that level, we'll have a
clear indication of a new uptrend's start.

However, the alternative scenario is less likely than the first one
which implies moving within a triangle.

### What will be the price of euro in 2021?

Now let's make a realistic forecast for the year 2021. Having studied
the price [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) and the changes in [Bollinger Bands](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/bollinger-bands.html) width, I built
candlestick projections for each month based on the scenario that
implies a pullback from the triangle's upper edge.

The analysis of the previous downside local wave suggests that a
projected fall may last till the end of the year. The market will break
the previous low at 1.17 USD and confirm bears' power in the nearest
months. Support at 1.14 USD will be a new price target.

The downtrend's potential may get exhausted towards the autumn, and the
pair might not continue its downward movement. So, the market may turn
flat.

However, the support levels may be retested, and a local bearish wave
may resume as early as the end of 2021 — the beginning of 2022. I can
presume that the price target for 2022 will be at the triangle's lower
edge in the range of 1.08 — 1.09 USD.

## Euro/dollar weekly price forecast as of 01.11.2021

Last week, the EURUSD price was testing the key resistance of the
medium-term downtrend. The resistance zone is 1.1700 – 1.1718. The price
didn’t break out the resistance, and sellers went ahead, driving the
price down to Target Zone 4, 1.1562 — 1.1544 on Friday.

The price will continue falling if it breaks out the support level of
1.1527 and consolidates below. In this case, the next downside target
will be in Target Zone 5, 1.1386 – 1.1368.

Otherwise, if the market doesn’t break out Target Zone 4, one could
enter a purchase in the correction with the target to break through the
high of last week.

### [EURUSD][1] Trading ideas for the week:

Monitor the market.

## Long-Term Euro to USD Forecast 2025-2030

Any long-term forecasts for 2025-2030, even for the [EUR/USD][1] pair or
any other currency pair, are too unreliable to include in our
predictions. This Euro to Dollar forecast would be pure speculation. For
this reason, we will not provide prediction charts beyond 2023. Too many
factors may affect the rate of currency pairs and the EUR/USD
projection, and it’s best to be up-to-date with what’s happening in the
global arena in order to make realistic and reliable predictions. In the
next section of our article, we have described in detail what factors
may affect the quotes of the EUR/USD pair.

### Which Factors Affect the Quotes of the EUR/USD Currency Pair?

The EUR/USD rate is the ratio of the currencies of the two largest
economies in the world – the EU and the USA. Therefore, important
economic and political [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) from the EU and the US directly affects the
euro-dollar rate. These factors of influence are called fundamental; in
addition to them, there are also technical ones. Let's consider both
those and others in more detail:

#### Fundamental Factors

There are several important economic indicators for the US and EU. The
most significant indicators affecting the course of a pair include the
following:

  * Change in interest rates of the ECB and the Fed (Interest rate)
  * Unemployment Rate
  * Data on jobs created in the US (Nonfarm Payrolls)
  * Growth rate of GDP (GDP)
  * Inflation indices (CPI, PPI)
  * Industrial production (Industrial Production index)
  * Retail Sales
  * Trade balance (Trade Balance)
  * Consumer Confidence Index
  * Indices of business sentiment (ISM, IFO)
  * Speeches by top officials - press conferences of the heads of the ECB and the Fed, speeches, and comments by leading politicians from the EU and the United States. For example, Trump's tweets could provoke significant movement in a currency pair.
  * Political events - various reshuffles in the government, elections, popular unrest, internal political instability (e.g., Brexit)
  * Force majeure - extraordinary events, natural disasters, man-made disasters, terrorist attacks, epidemics

#### Technical Factors

  * Active trend - an essential technical factor for trading is the presence of an active trend. In an uptrend, purchases are preferable; in a downtrend, sales are recommended, in a sideways trend (range), trading in both directions from the boundaries of the price range is appropriate.
  * Important support and resistance levels are [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) highs and lows on the price chart. These are important price reference points for analyzing and predicting the future movement of the pair.
  * Price patterns - various patterns of continuation or reversal of a trend from classical technical analysis, candlestick patterns, Price Action patterns.

## Is EUR/USD Still a Good Investment?

The [EUR/USD][1] currency pair is still quite young; its trading life
began quite recently – in 1999. But despite their youth, this pair
confidently took first place in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of the volume of transactions on
Forex. Due to its enormous liquidity, projection, availability, and low
spread, the pair enjoys well-deserved popularity among traders. Below is
a EUR/USD prediction chart for 2021:

Month| Open| Low-High| Close| Mo,%| Total,%  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
2021  
 **Feb**|  1.214| 1.194-1.230|  **1.212**|  -0.2%| -0.2%  
 **Mar**|  1.212| 1.193-1.229|  **1.211**|  -0.1%| -0.2%  
 **Apr**|  1.211| 1.184-1.220|  **1.202**|  -0.7%| -1.0%  
 **May**|  1.202| 1.202-1.250|  **1.232**|  2.5%| 1.5%  
 **Jun**|  1.232| 1.232-1.282|  **1.263**|  2.5%| 4.0%  
 **Jul**|  1.263| 1.235-1.273|  **1.254**|  -0.7%| 3.3%  
 **Aug**|  1.254| 1.212-1.254|  **1.230**|  -1.9%| 1.3%  
 **Sep**|  1.230| 1.227-1.265|  **1.246**|  1.3%| 2.6%  
 **Oct**|  1.246| 1.246-1.302|  **1.283**|  3.0%| 5.7%  
 **Nov**|  1.283| 1.279-1.317|  **1.298**|  1.2%| 6.9%  
 **Dec**|  1.298| 1.296-1.336|  **1.316**|  1.4%| 8.4%

But what does the [EUR/USD][1] forecast predict for the distant future?
It’s important to remember that any long-term forecasts, even the
EUR/USD forecast, or any other currency pair, are too unreliable to make
predictions for. Too many factors may affect the rate of currency pairs,
and it’s best to be up-to-date with what’s happening in the global arena
in order to make realistic and reliable predictions.

If you do decide that trading with this currency pair is something for
