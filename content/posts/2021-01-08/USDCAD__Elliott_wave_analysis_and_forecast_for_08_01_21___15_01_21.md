USDCAD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 08.01.21 – 15.01.21Alex
Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 1.2953 with a target of 1.2550 – 1.2400.

 **Alternative scenario:** ****breakout and consolidation above the
level of 1.2953 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of
1.3174 – 1.3384.

 **Analysis:** Daily time frame: wave (С) of 4 of larger degree
continues developing, with the first wave 1 of (C) forming inside.
Presumably, the fifth wave v of 1 of (C) is forming on the H4 time
frame, with wave (iii) of v of smaller degree completed inside.
Apparently, a local correction (iv) of v started to form on the H1 time
frame. If this assumption is correct, the pair will continue to fall to
the levels of 1.2550 – 1.2400 once the correction’s over. The level of
1.2953 is critical in this scenario, as the breakout will enable the
pair to continue rising to the levels of 1.3174 – 1.3384.
