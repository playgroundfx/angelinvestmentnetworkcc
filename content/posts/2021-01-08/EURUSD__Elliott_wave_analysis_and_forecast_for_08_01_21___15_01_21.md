EURUSD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 08.01.21 - 15.01.21Alex
Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions above the level of 1.2116
with a target of 1.2400 – 1.2500 once the correction formed.

 **Alternative scenario:** ****breakout and consolidation below the
level of 1.2116 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels
of 1.1971 – 1.1738.

 **Analysis:** Daily time frame: presumably, the first wave of larger
degree 1 of (3) continues developing, with wave v of 1 forming inside.
On the H4 time frame, the third wave of smaller degree (iii) of v
finished forming, and a descending correction is developing as the
fourth wave (iv) of v. Apparently, wave a of (iv) is forming on the H1
time frame. If this assumption is correct, the pair will continue rising
to 1.2400 – 1.2500 once wave (iv) of v finished forming. The level of
1.2116 is critical in this scenario. Its breakout will allow the pair to
continue falling to the levels of 1.1971 – 1.1738.
