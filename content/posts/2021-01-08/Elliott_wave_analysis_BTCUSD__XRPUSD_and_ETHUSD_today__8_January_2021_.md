Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 08.01.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I suggest entry signals
to trade each cryptocurrency.

Ripple should have finished the down wave (W), and there is forming the
upward wave (X).

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

 ****

The most recent price chart section displays the upward impulse wave
(5), which is composed of five waves 1-2-3-4-5. There is forming the
bullish impulse wave 5, consisting of the sub-waves [1]-[2]-[3]-[4]-[5];
it is a five-wave impulse. The first four legs of this impulse have
completed, so the price should be rising to a level of 41000.00 in the
final sub-waves [5]. One could enter long positions in the current
situation.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 38641.00 TP 41000.00

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

 ****

The XRPUSD market must have ended the down wave (W) in late December
2020. There is now forming the linking down wave (X) as a flat A-B-C.
Wave A is a triple zigzag; wave B is a standard zigzag, wave C is a
bullish impulse that is still forming. The price should be rising in the
final sub-wave [5] of C to a level of 0.407. At this level, the linking
wave (X) will be 50% of wave (W) according to Fibonacci retracements.

### Trading plan for **[XRPUSD][2]** today:

Buy 0.308, TP 0.407

* * *

## Elliott wave Ethereum analysis

 ****

There is forming the upward impulse wave 5, with the final fifth wave
forming inside. The first three legs have finished in the sub-wave [v].
There is forming the corrective wave (iv), which is likely to be a flat
a-b-c. Correction b of this flat may end at a level of 1233.13. Next,
the price will decline in impulse c, as it is outlined in the chart.

### Trading plan for  **[ETHUSD][3] **today:

Buy 1158.41, TP 1233.13
