XAUUSD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 08.01.21 - 15.01.21Alex
Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions from corrections above the
level of 1861.48 with a target of 2016.08 – 2073.73.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
1861.48 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of
1760.88 – 1718.57.

 **Analysis:** Presumably, the ascending third wave of larger degree (3)
formed and a descending correction developed as wave (4) on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/)
time frame. H4 time frame: apparently, the fifth wave (5) has started
forming, with wave 1 of (5) formed inside. On the H1 time frame, a local
correction 2 of (5) is developing as wave 2 of (5), with wave a of 2
forming inside. If the presumption is correct, after correction, the
pair will continue to rise to the levels of 2016.08 – 2073.73. The level
of 1861.48 is critical in this scenario as its breakout will enable the
pair to continue declining to the levels of 1760.88 – 1718.57.
