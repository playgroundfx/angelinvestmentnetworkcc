USDJPY: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 08.01.21 – 15.01.21Alex
Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions from corrections above the
level of 102.58 with a target of 105.31 – 106.17.

 **Alternative scenario:** ****breakout and consolidation below the
level of 102.58 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels
of 101.74 – 100.00.

 **Analysis:** Daily time frame: presumably, a correction of larger
degree is completed in the form of wave (B). Wave (С) has started to
form, with the third wave 3 of (C) developing inside. On the H4 time
frame, the third wave of smaller degree iii of 3 finished forming, and
an ascending correction started developing as the fourth wave iv of 3.
Apparently, wave (а) of iv is developing on the H1 time frame. If this
assumption is correct, the pair will continue to rise to 105.31 –
106.17. The level of 102.58 is critical in this scenario, as the
breakout will enable the pair to continue declining to the levels of
101.74 – 100.00.
