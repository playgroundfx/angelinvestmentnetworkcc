Dollar will yield the throne. Review as of 08.01.2021Dmitri Demidenko

The yuan will hardly compete with the dollar in the coming years, but
who knows what will happen in 10 or 20 years.

## The dollar's dominance will end, sooner or later

The lower the USD falls, the more often they talk about the end of its
dominance in the market. This kind of talk isn't something new: at the
beginning of the 21st century, the main claimant to the throne was the
euro. Nowadays, it's the yuan. The single European currency hasn't ever
been the first racer, but the yuan may be the one in the next few years.
Unless the greenback itself yields the first place to the Chinese
currency:

> \- My husband made me an incredible, fantastic, unforgettable gift
last night!

>

> \- Wow, was he passionate and insatiable?

>

> \- No, he went on a business trip yesterday.

I can hardly imagine that the world's fifth currency used for
international payments, with a market share in conversion operations and
gold & currency reserves of less than 5 percent, can be a serious
competitor of the first global currency. However, it's a speed that
matters in Forex, where time is measured in decades and a year is a
negligibly small period. In 2010, the renminbi ranked 35th among the
world's payment currencies. Its share in central banks' reserves has
been growing fast since then. For reference, the greenback's share
dropped to its lowest value last seen in the 90ies.

The dollar's dominance wasn't questionable before the pandemic. It even
gave birth to the "dollar's smile" notion: when the USD index fell,
almost no one doubted it would grow again. These days, the smile is
looking more like a grin. The greenback's power was based on two basic
factors: a belief that the US is a benchmark of the global economy and a
habit of using the USD as a safe-haven asset during crises. The dollar's
evolution affects many Forex pairs' moves, but many things changed in
2020. HSBC remarks on the yuan's significant influence on the euro's,
the pound's, and commodity currencies' rates. At the same time, Societe
Generale mentions that the renminbi is the best indicator of [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s'
appetite for risk. What will 2021 be like? It depends on the current
Chinese diet.

It's Asia and not North America that [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s often look at more often
when forming their investment strategies. Trump's last attempts to ban
the Americans from buying Chinese stocks look miserable. The foreign
portfolio investment in China grew 30% from January to September, and
this trend has only started developing. The [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are fed up with
the dollar. Is it essential to know who is guilty?

> \- Darling, it seems I'm pregnant. I don't know who the father is, but
it's you who makes me sick.

Not only did the pandemic undermine the dollar's authority, but it also
took away its main trump - the belief that the US pushes the global
economy upwards. The US GDP will hardly grow by as little as 4% in 2021.
I doubt it can return to the levels seen at the end of 2019. Its Chinese
peer may grow 8% and 10%, compared with 2020 and 2019, respectively. Who
is the global economy's driver these days? The answer is evident.

Furthermore, COVID-19 moved China's estimated economic superiority in
[terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of GDP from 2033 to 2028. Time is measured in decades in Forex.
New kings are born, old kings yield the throne. Life goes on!
