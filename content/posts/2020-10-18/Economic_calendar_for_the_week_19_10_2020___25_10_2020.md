Economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the week 19.10.2020 – 25.10.2020Jana Kane

##  **Review of the main events of the Forex economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the
next trading week (19.10.2020 – 25.10.2020)**

 **Trading on key Forex [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/): next week we are expecting the publication
of important macro statistics data from China, Australia, Great Britain,
Germany, Eurozone, Canada, New Zealand, as well as the results of the US
presidential debates.**

The dollar strengthened last week. As a result, the DXY dollar index
rose 0.6%, mainly due to the strengthening of the dollar against the
euro and pound, whose share in the DXY index is about 57% and 12%,
respectively.

The euro and pound remain under pressure from a sharp increase in the
number of coronavirus cases in Europe and the UK, which could provoke
new strict quarantine measures that restrict economic activity.

The pound is also affected by the Brexit situation after the EU leaders'
summit failed to make progress on a trade deal with the UK. At the
beginning of next week, negotiations on a trade deal between the EU and
the UK will continue, but only by telephone.

The outlook for the UK and European economies is deteriorating, which
could push their central banks to adopt new stimulus measures. As ECB
Governing Council member Olli Rehn said last week in an interview with
Reuters, "the latest data are disappointing, especially in the services
sector, and they increase the risk of the situation worsening." In his
opinion, the recovery of the European economy turned out to be weaker
than expected, and "inflationary risks are decreasing."

Investors' attention next week will be on the publication of important
macro data from China, Australia, Great Britain, Germany, Eurozone,
Canada, New Zealand, as well as the debate of the US presidential
candidates.

 **Traders should pay attention to the publication of the following
macro indicators:**

 ***during the coming week, new events may be added to the [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) and
/ or some scheduled events may be canceled**

###  **02:00 CNY China's GDP for the 3rd quarter**

National Bureau of Statistics of China will present data on GDP growth
in the 3rd quarter.

In the second quarter, China's GDP grew by +11.5% (+3.2% YoY) after
contracting -6.8% (-9.8% YoY) in the 1st quarter and growing in the 3rd
and 4th quarters of 2019 by +1.5% and +6.0%, respectively.

China's GDP is expected to grow by +11.3 %% (+5.1% yoy) in the third
quarter of 2020.

China is the largest buyer of raw materials and a supplier of a wide
range of finished products to the world commodity market. China's
economy is the second largest in the world after America's. Therefore,
the publication of important macroeconomic indicators from China can
have a strong impact on the entire financial market.

The relative decline in GDP may negatively affect the yuan quotes, as
well as the quotes of commodity currencies and currencies of the Asia-
Pacific region, since may indicate a slowdown in the growth rate of the
Chinese economy.

The growth of the indicator will have a positive effect on the Chinese
yuan, as well as on the world, primarily Asian stock indices, as well as
on the quotes of commodity currencies such as the New Zealand and
Australian dollars. China is the largest trade and economic partner of
Australia and New Zealand and a buyer of commodities from these
countries.

Therefore, positive macro statistics from China may also have a positive
effect on the quotes of these commodity currencies.

###  **02:00** **CNY Retail Sales Index**

This index is published monthly by the National Bureau of Statistics of
China and measures total retail sales and cash receipts. The index is
often considered an indicator of consumer confidence and economic well-
being and reflects the health of the retail sector in the near term. A
rise in the index is usually positive for the CNY; a decrease in the
indicator will negatively affect CNY. The previous value of the index
(in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) was +0.5% (after an increase of +8% in the last months
of 2019 and a fall of -20.5% in January 2020). Outlook: In September,
retail sales in China increased by +1.7% (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)), which
indicates a still weak recovery after a strong fall in February-March
this year. If the data turns out to be even weaker, the CNY will
decline.

###  **00:30 AUD Minutes of the October meeting of the RB of Australia**

This document is published two weeks after the meeting and the decision
on the interest rate. If the RBA positively assesses the state of the
labor market in the country, the rate of GDP growth, and also shows a
hawkish attitude towards the inflationary forecast in the economy, the
markets regard this as a higher probability of a rate hike at the next
meeting, which is a positive factor for the AUD. The bank's mild
rhetoric regarding, above all, inflation puts pressure on the AUD.

At its October 6 meeting, the central bank kept its current monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) unchanged. The key interest rate of the RBA was kept at a record
low level of 0.25%, and the target level of yield on 3-year government
bonds was also left at 0.25%. The decision to lower the rate and
determine the current target level of government bond yields was made at
the previous unscheduled RBA meeting on March 19 in order to support
business and Australian citizens amid the rapid spread of the
coronavirus pandemic. The country's government was also forced to
introduce a social distancing regime, suspend businesses and close
borders to international traffic.

"The economic recovery will be uneven and unstable," and "unemployment
may remain high for a long time," the RBA leaders said, promising that
"the rate will not be increased until the Central Bank sees progress in
moving towards full employment and stable inflation in the range of
2-3%”.

At the same time, the RBA admitted that "the economic drawdown was not
as strong as expected."

According to RBA Governor Philip Lowe, "there are no serious arguments
in favor of tightening monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) in the short term," and "some
time will pass before interest rates are increased."

Nevertheless, if the published minutes contain unexpected information
concerning the issues of the RBA's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), the volatility in
the AUD quotes will grow.

###  **01:30 CNY Decision of the People's Bank of China on the interest
rate**

Since May 2012, the People's Bank of China has been steadily cutting
interest rates to support Chinese manufacturers. The last time in 2020
the bank cut the rate in April (by 0.20% to 3.85% at the moment).

In recent months, amid international trade conflicts and a slowdown in
the global economy, the world's largest central banks have been moving
towards softening their monetary policies in order to support national
economies and increase the competitiveness of goods exported from these
countries.

The People's Bank of China is also in line with this process. The
depreciation of the yuan has become especially relevant in the last 2
years, when the confrontation between the two most powerful economies in
the world began. One of the measures to mitigate the negative
consequences of increased duties on the import of Chinese goods into the
United States was the depreciation of the national currency of China.
This measure was intended, among other things, to maintain the same
volumes of imports of Chinese products to the United States, which would
cost American buyers less due to the difference in the rates of the
national currencies of the United States and China.

Now, another strong negative factor has been added to this - the
coronavirus.

Probably, at this meeting, the People's Bank of China will keep the
interest rate at the same level of 3.85%, although a rate cut is also
possible.

However, if the People's Bank of China makes unexpected statements or
decisions, volatility may increase throughout the financial market.
Investors will also be interested in the bank's assessment of the
consequences of the coronavirus for the Chinese economy and its [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
in the near future in this regard.

###  **00:30 AUD Retail Sales Index**

Retail Sales Index is published monthly by the Australian Bureau of
Statistics and measures total retail sales. The index is often
considered an indicator of consumer confidence and reflects the health
of the retail sector in the near term. Index growth is usually positive
for the AUD; a decrease in the indicator will negatively affect the AUD.
The previous value of the index (in August) was -4.0% after falling by
-17.7% in April. If September data turns out to be weaker than the
previous value, the AUD may sharply decline in the short term.

###  **06:00 GBP Consumer Price Index. Core Consumer Price Index**

Consumer Price Index (CPI) reflects the dynamics of retail prices for a
group of goods and services that make up the British consumer basket.
CPI is a key indicator of inflation. Its publication causes active
movement of the pound in the foreign exchange market, as well as the
London Stock Exchange FTSE100 index.

In the previous reporting month (August), the growth in consumer
inflation (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) amounted to +0.2%.

Forecast for September: +0.3% (annualized). This value is unlikely to
provide significant support to the pound. Indicator value below the
forecast could provoke a weakening of the pound, as low inflation will
force the Bank of England to adhere to a soft monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).

Core CPI is published by the Office for National Statistics and
determines the price change of a selected basket of goods and services
(excluding food and energy) for a given period. It is a key indicator
for assessing inflation and changes in purchasing preferences. A
positive result strengthens the GBP, a negative one weakens it.

In August, Core CPI (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) increased by +0.9%. The
publication of the indicator is likely to have a positive effect on the
pound if its value is higher than the forecast and the previous value.
Forecast for September: +1.3% (annualized). The indicator value below
the forecast and previous values ​​may provoke a weakening of the pound.

###  **12:30 CAD Consumer price indices in Canada. Retail Sales Index**

Core Consumer Price Index (Core CPI) from the Bank of Canada reflects
the dynamics of the retail prices of the corresponding basket of goods
and services (excluding fruits, vegetables, gasoline, fuel oil, natural
gas, mortgage interest, intercity transport, and tobacco products). The
inflation target for the Bank of Canada is in the range of 1-3%. A rise
in CPI is a harbinger of a rate hike and a positive factor for the CAD.
Core CPI rose in August by +0.8% (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)). If the September
data turns out to be worse than the previous values, it will negatively
affect the CAD. Better-than-expected data and data above previous values
​​will strengthen the Canadian dollar.

September forecast: CPI will come out with a value of +0.4% (in annual
[terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)).

Retail Sales Index is published monthly by Statistics Canada and
estimates total retail sales. The index is often considered an indicator
of consumer confidence and reflects the health of the retail sector in
the near term. A rise in the index is usually positive for the CAD; a
decrease in the indicator will negatively affect the CAD. The previous
value of the index (in July) was +0.6% after falling by -9.9% in March,
by -25% in April and by +18.7% in May. If the data for August turns out
to be weaker than the previous value, the CAD may decline in the short
term. The preliminary forecast for August was +1.1%.

###  **Thursday, October 22**

###  **21:45 NZD CPI (Consumer Price Index) for Q3**

Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a key indicator for assessing inflation
and reflects the dynamics of retail prices for a group of goods and
services that make up the consumer basket. A positive result strengthens
the NZD, a negative one weakens it. Previous CPI values (YoY): +1.5% in
Q2, +2.5% in Q1 2020, +1.9% in Q4 2019. A relative decrease in the
indicator may negatively affect the NZD quotes.

###  **Friday, October 23**

###  **01:00** **USD Presidential debates in the US**

Financial market participants will follow this debate. Economists
believe that under Biden, stronger fiscal stimulus measures can be
expected that will be highly appropriate for economic recovery in the
near term, while under Trump, the prospect of a long period of extremely
low interest rates is more likely to support business activity over a
longer period of time, and this is extremely important for buyers of
high-yield and risky stock assets betting on the further growth of the
American stock market.

At the same time, many economists agree that any outcome of the
presidential election will be positive for the American stock market.
The growth of stock indices, at the same time, will most likely be
accompanied by a fall in the dollar.

###  **07:30 EUR Markit Economics Manufacturing PMI in Germany
(preliminary release). Markit Economics Composite PMI (preliminary
release)**

Germany's Manufacturing PMI is an important indicator of the business
environment and the overall health of the German economy. This sector of
the economy forms a significant part of Germany's GDP. A result above 50

for the euro. October forecast (pre-release): 52.5.

Previous values: 56.4 in September, 52.2 in August, 51.0 in July, 45.2
in June, 36.6 in May, 34.5 in April, 45.4 in March, 48 in February, 45 ,
3 in January, which indicates a continuing recovery in business activity
in this sector of the German economy, although the average value for
several months is still below 50. A rise in the indicator above the
previous value and the value of 50 may support the euro (in the short
term). The data worse than the forecast will have a negative impact on
the euro.

business environment and the overall health of the German economy. A
result above 50 is considered positive and strengthens the EUR, one
below 50 - as negative for the euro. October forecast (preliminary

in June, 32.3 in May, 17.4 in April, 35 in March, 50.7 in February, 51.2
in January. The publication of this indicator with the specified
expected value is likely to support the euro in the short term. The data
worse than the forecast and below the value of 50.0, as a rule, have a
negative impact on the euro.

###  **08:00 EUR Markit Economics Composite Manufacturing PMI
(preliminary release)**

Eurozone's Manufacturing PMI is an important indicator of the health of
the entire European economy. A result above 50 is considered positive
and strengthens the EUR, one below 50 - as negative for the euro.

be worse than the forecast and the value of 50, the euro may drop
sharply in the short term.

###  **08:30 GBP Markit Economics Services PMI (preliminary release)**

UK's Services PMI is an important indicator of the health of the UK
economy. The services sector employs most of the UK's working-age
population and accounts for approximately 78% of GDP. Financial services
continue to be the most important part of the services industry. If the
data turns out to be worse than the forecast and the previous value, the
pound is likely to drop sharply in the short term. The data better than
the forecast and the previous value will have a positive impact on the
pound. At the same time, a result above 50 is considered positive and
strengthens the GBP, one below 50 - as negative for the GBP.
