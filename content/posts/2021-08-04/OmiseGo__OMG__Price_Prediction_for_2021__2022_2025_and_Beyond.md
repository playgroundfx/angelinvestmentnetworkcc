OMG Price Prediction: What’s the Power of OMG?Jana Kane

Today we're going to talk about OmiseGo! OmiseGo was founded by the
company Omise, which was founded in 2013 by Jun Hasegawa and Ezra Don
Harinsut. The company offers a payment management service. Companies can
thus accept payments that go through the internet. You might say a well-
known concept, but there is more!

OmiseGo is not just any payment management service; it has made quite a
few partners with large companies over the years. One of these large
companies is McDonald’s in Thailand, for example. On June 6, 2020,
OmiseGo rebranded and transitioned to the mainnet. From that moment on,
it was called the OMG Network.

The article covers the following subjects:

Since its inception, OMG Network (OMG) has always been [in the top 100
on Coinmarketcap][1]. That’s reason enough to write an article about
OMG. In this article, we will discuss how the OMG Network price is
currently going, the reason for the price direction, and expert OMG
price predictions and forecasts for the future. Let's dive into why you
should also have OmiseGo in your crypto portfolio! So, are you ready?
Let's go!

## About OmiseGO

OmiseGo originated from the company that already handled many
transactions in Asia under the name Omise. OmiseGo is Omise's [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/)
solution. So, the idea is that OmiseGo is a similar solution for intra-
bank payments, comparable to the SWIFT network we know.

Do you want to transfer a payment from one country to another in the
continent of Asia? Then you can get ready and expect to pay major fees.
In particular, expats who work in another country often want to transfer
money to family members who have stayed behind. And that is not so easy.

First of all, such a family must have a comparable bank account in order
to be able to complete the transaction at all. In addition, substantial
amounts are charged to actually facilitate this. These costs do not make
the often-dire financial situation of these families any better. Every
cent in costs that then has to be paid is actually too much.

OmiseGo will facilitate such transactions over the OmiseGo [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/).
The platform launched the OMG cryptocurrency, which is an ERC20 token.
This means that OmiseGO is a [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) on the Ethereum [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/). OMG
uses Ethereum for its workflows but also develops a symbiotic
relationship with the network, which acts as a scalable solution. They
are working on tools with which software developers can create their own
software wallets. These wallets then run on the OmiseGo [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) and
can hold many different fiat and cryptocurrencies. Consider, for
example, the euro, the US dollar, and also Bitcoin and local currencies
from the individual Asian countries. Of course, the OmiseGo token itself
should not be missing: the coin with the best name ever invented, the
OMG coin.

The network is aimed at achieving extremely low fees so that large
groups of people from the poorer parts of the world can use the network
to participate in financial traffic at a decent cost.

### The Power of OMG

OMG Network ensures that everyone can get a wallet. You can see this
wallet as your own bank account on the [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/). With this wallet, you
have access to the financial market. With the OMG Network wallet, you
can buy products, transfer money, and put many different currencies on
the wallet. OmiseGO is an open-source [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) platform whose main
slogan is “Unbank the Banked.” OmiseGO is expected to become a direct
competitor to traditional banking institutions.

You can transfer from one [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) to another by using these wallet
coins. It also makes it possible to transfer money between [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/)s
and traditional payment providers such as VISA and SWIFT.

Now there are several wallets that facilitate this. What makes OMG
Network stronger than the rest is that OMG Network originated from the
Omise company. This company has years of experience with online
payments.

Because they originated from Omise, they benefit from brand awareness
and the network. As a result, OMG Network already has a number of
partnerships with large companies. McDonald's Thailand has already
partnered with them.

Ayudhya and SMBC are two major Japanese banks that have invested in OMG
Network. If these partnerships grow, this can be very favorable for the
OMG course expectations.

## Omisego & McDonald’s

[OmiseGo has entered into a partnership with McDonald’s in 2017][2]. In
concrete [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/), this means that in Thailand, for example, every
McDonald’s restaurant accepts the OMG coin. That may not sound very
impressive, but if you assume that there are 70 million people in
Thailand who can suddenly all pay cheaper at McDonald’s, then this can
have a significant positive impact on the OmiseGo philosophy.

## OMG in 2021 and Some History

Quite an impressive result, that's a decent summary of the OmiseGo ICO
held in 2017. In June, the ICO was opened to [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s for a month, and
OmiseGo managed to rake in a whopping $25 million within a month.

  * 65.1% of all tokens were distributed to [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s;
  * 20% remains in reserve;
  * 9.9% went to the team;
  * 5% was used to provide incentives to Ethereum holders.

That the ICO not only provided a nice amount for OmiseGo itself but was
also a top investment for everyone who joined is evident from the price
development. No less than a return of 1500% has been recorded. During
the ICO, 1 OMG cost just under 23 cents. Today, the same OMG is worth
more than $3. That’s really promising! Nice!

As it always goes with cryptocurrency projects, the price differs greatly. That is why it does not make much sense to keep an eye on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) [OMG exchange rate][3] (except if you’re a scalper trader, of course); tomorrow, this will be different. The current OMG rate can be found below:   

## OMG Expert Price Predictions

What is OmiseGo going to be worth in the coming months and even years?
If it’s going to be worth more than it is now, then it’s a good
investment! Let’s see what some of the influencers think;

Vitalik Buterin said in 2017 that the OMG coin was already very
underestimated, and he claimed its advantages:

[CoinLiker][4] predicts that OMG will grow in value over the long-term
timeframe. They predict the price of 1 OMG will be $11.19 this time next
year, $19.09 in 3 years’ time, and $31.14 in 5 years’ time.

[TradingBeasts][2] predicted that one OMG coin would be worth around 4
USD by December 2020. They also predicted that one OMG coin would be
worth about 51 USD by June 2021. One OMG coin is now worth $3.22 USD, so
their first prediction was quite close.

[WalletInvestor thinks][5] OMG is an awesome long-term investment (one
year). With a 5-year investment, they expect the revenue to be around
+700.42%. This means a current $100 investment may be up to $800.42 in
2025.

 **These estimates show three things:**

  1. There is a lot of confidence in the technology the OMG Network is using and the team that’s developing it. It’s making important connections with real-world businesses and is developing some cool new technology, too.
  2. Many top-100 [cryptocurrency price](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/cryptocurrency-price/)s are expected to go up across the market in the next six months.
  3. Crypto experts, more often than not, predict that the price of cryptocurrencies _will go down! (Sssh! We won’t tell if you won’t!)_

## OMG Technical Analysis

Let's start our [OMGUSD][3] technical analysis[][3]on the monthly price
chart.

The chart above suggests that ex-[OmiseGo][6] has been moving up in a
broad range since 2020. At the same time, there's strong support at
around 3.30 USD that bears have failed to break through in the past
three months. That level is marked with a red line.

Since the OMGUSD price chart is at the lower range limit, a local
bullish trend with a price target of 12 US dollars suggests itself in
the long run.

## OMG Forecast For Next Three Months

Let's confirm or cancel that forecast through a technical analysis of
the weekly chart.

To make an OMGUSD price prediction, we will use the [MACD][7] and the
Stochastic [RSI][8].

Both indicators are at the lower limits in the chart above. Stochastic
is in the oversold area and attempts to reverse. The MACD histogram
turned red quite long ago. The moving averages are directed down, but
there's a probability of a bullish signal in 3-4 weekly candles.

This situation indicates that a flat trend at the lower limit will last
for at least several weeks, but consolidation may turn into an upside
price movement within one month.

### Long-Term OMG Analysis for 2021/2022

The interim results of our OMG technical analysis point to an optimistic
market picture where OMG can potentially break through the upper limit
of the range.

Still, the analysis of OMG prices over the past two years shows us that
OMG price movements have been inconsistent. Uptrends were formed through
recurrent bullish impulses and drastic pullbacks. So, OMG's future
prices may develop the same way, and OMG's expected trading range might
be huge.

The chart above presents a Fibonacci grid plotted from the minimum of
March 2020 to the maximum in May 2021. The main extremums coincide with
the key levels of the grid. Those levels have also been considered when
making a realistic forecast for OMG value.

The frequency of momentum may differ from the forecast and will mostly
depend on the incline of a local bullish trend. The less gentle the
angle is, the longer the pattern will last.

The limits of an expected trading range are presented according to the
forecast in the chart above and the table below.

The OMGUSD cryptocurrency will be trading in a range marked with blue
lines for the most of 2021-2022. The upper limit of the range may be
broken shortly before the end of summer 2022 or even earlier. Everything
will depend on buyers' activity and the OMGUSD projected growth.

#### Long-term trading plan for OMG

Let's now make a trading plan for the [OMG cryptocurrency][3]. It should
consist in capitalizing on the next powerful bullish momentum that may
reach 20 US dollars or even more.

However, it might be difficult to identify the beginning of that
momentum. Based on the price [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/), we may have 3 or 4 smaller waves
before the momentum itself, but we can't say for sure how often they
will be forming. So, the wisest strategy would be:

  1. Opening a long trade at 3.60-3.70 USD with Stop Loss below 3 USD.

  2. Temporizing and trailing Stop Loss as the trend unfolds upwards.

  3. Fixing 50% of the position at around 15 USD and let the other half grow to the price target of 20 USD.

## OMG Price Prediction

In the West, everyone has easy access to banks - but in Asia, this is
not the case. Just transferring money to other banks is not possible.
When this is possible, it costs a lot of money. These transaction costs
are often not affordable for poorer people.

We must not forget that there are two billion households that do not
have a bank. In Southeast Asia alone, there are 438 million people
without a bank. OMG Network can be the solution for these people.

With OMG Network’s solution, you don’t have to deal with middlemen
charging high transaction fees. Instead, you can easily transfer
different currencies within seconds.

There is, therefore, a huge market open for OMG Network that makes the
potential of this cryptocurrency incredibly large. In addition to
transferring money to, for example, family, it can also be used to pay
when companies join OMG Network.

When OMG Network reaches people who do not yet have a bank, and the
wallet turns out to be an excellent alternative for a bank, this can
work out very well for the OMG trend. This can result in a high OMG
[cryptocurrency price](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/cryptocurrency-price/) expectation.

### OMG Prediction 2021, 2023, 2025, 2030

OMG's idea is very promising. If the OMG Network team succeeds in
turning their plans into reality, it could become a big boy in the
crypto world. It is good to know that they have always kept to the
deadlines so far.

If OMG Network enters into more partnerships with large companies and
connects bankless people, the project will have a huge chance of
success.

The above reason is essential for a price appreciation. It could go very
quickly if partnerships are made in a short period of time. As a result,
confidence in the coin will increase as they grow. This draws in buyers
and, therefore, causes a skyrocketing price.

The OMG price forecast for 2020 looks very promising. Because OMG
Network is reliable and a solid company, the price will turn green. The
price of OMG is expected to rise to $4.

A huge increase is expected in 2022. The price of an OMG coin will then
be around $ 12. Keep in mind that this will not be solely due to the
success of OMG Network. There is a forecast that most coins in crypto
land will go up in 2022.

If we look even further into the future, the price will only go up. The
price will not go x12 again, but the price is expected to double to $24.

## How Did the Price of OMG Change Over Time?

The OMG price value fluctuated mainly in the beginning. The peaks and
troughs of OMG look pretty normal compared to other currency rates
around that time. After all the initial fluctuations, the OMG course
eventually stabilized around January 2019 until August 2020.

When OMG started an ICO, it was an immediate hit. The success of the ICO
showed that enough [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s trusted the project. As a result, OMG
raised $25 million in no time. This is also the amount they wanted in
advance, so a resounding success. Below you’ll find the [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/)
exchange rates for OMG/USD:

As mentioned earlier, there were many peaks and troughs in the price of
OMG. The all-time high for OMG was on January 8, 2018. The OMG value was
then 28.35 dollars.

## Conclusion

The rate of OmiseGo has been moving sideways for a while, but that can
change quickly - especially if the pilot at McDonald’s was successful or
the same pilot is rolled out to other countries in the area. Vietnam,
for example, also easily has 100 million inhabitants. Suppose that the
number of people using the OMG network suddenly increases by even 10% of
that; this could have a huge impact on the price development of OMG.

Whichever way you look at it, OmiseGo's initiative to help the world's
poorer countries with an affordable solution is one that is wonderful
from a social point of view. In that respect, we sincerely hope that
OmiseGo contributes to a better and affordable world, especially for the
people who need the help most.

The cryptocurrency market is truly crowded. Over the next few years,
there will be more losers than winners. The coins that succeed will have
the perfect combination of community, technology, and real-world value.

OmiseGo is close to having all three. It’s backed by some very powerful
organizations; it has lots of friends in the crypto community, and its
technology is as strong as any of its competitors. None of this makes
OmiseGo a guaranteed winner, though, so always consider the fact that
the future value is unpredictable.
