Dollar and Powell-gap. Forecast as of 04.08.2021Dmitri Demidenko

If US Treasury yields were rising, it would support the [EURUSD][1]
bears. Will the US bond yield rally resume? What will be the reasons and
results? Let us discuss the Forex outlook and make up a trading plan.

## Weekly US dollar fundamental forecast

The Fed deserves respect. The US central bank has made a significant
contribution to the US economic recovery. It will surely take control
over inflation through reverse repo loans and a reduction in the pace of
money supply growth. Furthermore, the Fed has avoided the repetition of
the taper tantrum of 2013 and holds back the US dollar strengthening by
a slow process of monetary normalization. Nonetheless, the Fed’s actions
resulted in an imbalance in the bond market, which could lead to serious
shocks if there are such triggers as default or change of the Fed Chair.

In the situation when the US economy is ahead of the European (the
second quarter can be excluded since there was a rebound after a double-
dip recession in the eurozone during this period), and the Fed is to
resort to monetary tightening much earlier than the ECB, the only
restraining factor for the [EURUSD][1] fall is the decline in Treasury
yields. And the Fed has influenced the current situation in the US bond
market.

First, the Fed has bought 76.4% of all federal debt issued during the
pandemic and currently owns 33.6% of all US government bonds. This is
about the same as the rest of the American [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s combined. Second,
the US central bank convinced the markets of the temporary nature of
inflation, the long-term high levels of which could force bondholders to
sell the papers. Third, the Fed made the markets believe that there
would be no repeat of the 2013 taper tantrum. As a result, Treasury
yields are declining, and there is a gap with global PMI, which Nordea
Markets called the Powell-gap.

The Fed’s deliberate pressure on the treasury yields seems reasonable.
On the one hand, it supports the stock market; on the other hand, such
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) holds back the US dollar. All this together maintains favorable
financial conditions for the US economy. At the same time, the existing
imbalance in the market increases the risks of serious shocks. The
reasons may be the unresolved issue of the national debt ceiling, the
associated default on US obligations, as well as the change of Jerome
Powell to Lael Brainard as the Fed Chair.

In my opinion, the Fed should end the QE as soon as possible, especially
since the Treasury's needs for a new issue in 2022 will sharply
decrease. According to JP Morgan, its volume next year will amount to
$1.46 trillion, which is $860 billion less than in 2021. One should not
be concerned about Joe Biden's new fiscal stimulus packages: most of
them have their own funding sources.

### Weekly [EURUSD][1] trading plan

I believe the Fed realizes the need to abandon its ultra-easy monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), but it needs a reason to announce the QE tapering. A strong jobs
report for July could become such a reason. The publication of the US
jobs report is an important event, so the [EURUSD][1] should be
consolidating in the range of 1.185-1.19. The breakouts of the
consolidation range before Friday are likely to be false breakouts. I
don’t recommend entering trades.
