Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 04.08.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

The cryptocurrency bears are going ahead, so the crypto prices should be
declining over the next few days.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

In the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) BTCUSD chart, there is the structure of the corrective wave
[B], which has completed as a double zigzag (W)-(X)-(Y). There has
started forming the bearish wave as an impulse. There have completed
small sub-waves (1)-(2), and wave (3) is developing. The Bitcoin price
should go down to 36370.00 and lower.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Sell 37926.50, TP 36370.00

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

The XRPUSD market must have completed the linking wave (X) as a flat.
The Ripple price is going down in the bearish wave. There should be
unfolding the initial par of the new impulse. Sub-waves [1]-[2] have
completed by now, so the market should continue declining in wave [3] to
a level below 0.642.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] **** today:

Sell 0.711, TP 0.642

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

There is displayed wave B, the middle part of the global zigzag, in the
[daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) timeframe of the ETHUSD price chart. The B wave has completed as a
simple zigzag. There should be unfolding the initial part of the bearish
wave, which could be an impulse 1-2-3-4-5. There have completed only the
two first sub-waves. The market is likely to be declining to a level of
2302.00, marked by the triangle (4).

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Sell 2490.95, TP 2302.00
