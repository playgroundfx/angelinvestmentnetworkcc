Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 04.08.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

The euro price has been declining slowly since July 30.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

The oil price has broken out the key support level 70.82. The short-term
trend turned down. The sell target is now in the lower Target Zone 68.43
– 67.88.

At the US session yesterday, the oil price has corrected to the
Additional Zone 70.38 – 70.24. The zone hasn’t been broken out, so it is
relevant to enter sell trades there with an intermediate target at
yesterday’s low.

If the Additional Zone is broken out, expect a correction up to the
Intermediary Zone 71.88 – 71.60 and enter sell trades according to the
pattern.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

  1. Sell according to the pattern in Additional Zone 70.38 - 70.24. TakeProfit: 68.95. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. Sell according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 71.88 - 71.60. TakeProfit: 68.95. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

Gold buyers hold up the key support of the short-term uptrend 1810 –
1807. However, the resistance zone of 1818 – 1817 has not been broken
out too. There is a flat zone between these two zones, where one can
trade in both directions: sell the precious metal in the resistance zone
and buy at the key support.

The further trend will be clear when the price breaks out the range of
1818 – 1807.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

  1. Aggressive: buy in the Intermediary Zone 1810 - 1807. TakeProfit: Additional Zone 1818 - 1817. StopLoss: 1803.1.

  2. Aggressive: sell in the Additional Zone 1818 - 1817. TakeProfit: Intermediary Zone 1810 - 1807. StopLoss: 1822.6.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

The euro price has been declining slowly since July 30. The price is
testing the Additional Zone 1.1864 - 1.1860. There is no buy pattern in
the zone, so continue monitoring the market and expect the price to go
down to the zone of 1.1850 – 1.1811.

After the support zone of 1.1850 – 1.1811 is tested, one could enter buy
trades according to the pattern with a target in the Target Zone 1.1948
– 1.1930. The trend border is at level 1.1786, which is far from the
current price, so it is not yet relevant to sell.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

Buy according to the pattern in the zone of 1.1850 - 1.1811. TakeProfit:
Target Zone 1.1948 - 1.1930. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.
