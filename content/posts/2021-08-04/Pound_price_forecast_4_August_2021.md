Three surprises for the Pound. Forecast as of 04.08.2021Dmitri Demidenko

The Bank of England is at a crossroads. The UK economy is strong, and
inflation is up to 2.5%. However, an early start of monetary
normalization can result in unwanted consequences. Let us discuss the
Forex outlook and make up a trading plan [GBPUSD][1].

## Weekly pound fundamental forecast

While the US dollar is trading flat ahead of the US jobs report, the
British pound is rising ahead of the BoE meeting. Andrew Bailey and his
fellow central bankers could provide a number of surprises, which should
not be dovish. This fact lures [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s to the sterling.

The BoE has 1.9 million reasons not to rush to normalize monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
and stick to the same stance as the Fed. 1.9 million is the number of
British people who have lost their jobs due to the pandemic and still
cannot find work. The recovery of the labor market is a necessary
condition to start tightening monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). The majority of MPC
members are ready to adhere to an accommodative [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) not to interrupt
the economic recovery. According to the IMF, the UK economy will grow
faster in 2021 than in any other G7 country, which is not surprising
against the background of successful vaccinations and lifting of the
lockdown. Currently, 57.6% of UK citizens have received both doses of
the vaccine. According to this indicator, the UK among the large is
third after Canada (59.7%) and Spain (57.9%) among the large developed
countries.

It might be too early to withdraw the stimulus, but the BoE should be
prepared to do it correctly. In 2018, the BoE set a threshold for the
Bank rate of 1.5%, upon reaching which it will start unwinding the QE
and stop reinvesting the proceeds of maturing gilts in new purchases. At
that time, the five-year gilt yields were at 1.2%; now, they are around
0.3%. Therefore, markets do not expect BoE rates to reach 1.5% any time
soon. Analysts expect a new lower bound for the Bank Rate of 0.5% -
0.75%. If the BoE scraps the threshold entirely, it will start reversing
QE before it raises rates. It is the first good [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) for the [GBPUSD][1]
bulls.

In my opinion, such a decision will look logical. If the BoE continues
to acquire assets at the same pace as before, the share of securities on
the central bank’s balance sheet will exceed 50% of their total value,
compared with 33.6% of the Fed. This is an amount equivalent to almost
40% of the UK GDP, compared with 20% before the pandemic. I suppose as
early as in August, at least 2 out of 8 MPC members can vote for the
start of QE tapering. If there are two hawks, it will be the second
surprise for the sterling bulls from the Bank of England.

Finally, the third pleasant surprise may be an increase in inflation
forecasts. The UK inflation reached a three-year high of 2.5% in June
and is likely to continue rising until the end of 2021. BoE can well
raise its CPI projections at the end of the year from the current 3% to
3.5%, which implies a 2% rise in consumer prices in 2022-2023 and can be
interpreted as a signal of an earlier Bank rate hike than is currently
expected by the market.

### Weekly [GBPUSD][1] trading plan

Therefore, the BoE can give three pleasant surprises to the pound
buyers, but it may not do it. The [GBPUSD][1] rally on the [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) could be
followed by a sell-off on the fact. It will be relevant to sell if the
pound doesn't break out level 1.3955 or updates the local high.
