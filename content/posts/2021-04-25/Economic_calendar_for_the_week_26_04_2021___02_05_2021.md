Economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the week 26.04.2021 – 02.05.2021Jana Kane

##  **Review of the main events of the Forex economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the
next trading week (26.04.2021 – 02.05.2021)**

 **Trading on key Forex [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/): next week we expect the publication of
important macro statistics from the US, Australia, Canada, Eurozone,
Germany, China, as well as the results of the meetings of the central
banks of Japan and the US.**

Last week, two of the world's largest central banks - Canada and the
Eurozone - held their regular meetings. While the Bank of Canada
surprised financial market participants by unexpectedly announcing a
slowdown in bond purchases due to improved economic prospects, the ECB
meeting went without surprises. Last Thursday the ECB leaders decided to
keep the parameters of the bank's current monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). The ECB said
in a statement that the bank will continue to buy Eurozone bonds under
an emergency program worth 1.85 trillion euros ($2.2 trillion) until at
least the end of March 2022. The ECB also reaffirmed its intention to
make purchases "at a substantially higher pace" expressed in March.

The euro fell after the ECB meeting, and the DXY dollar index, in which
the euro accounts for more than 50%, rose. Nevertheless, the DXY dollar
index closed last week, for the third in a row, with another decline,
losing support from the yield of US government bonds, which continued to
decline, and ceasing to respond with growth to positive macro data that
continues to come from the US.

Now the attention of market participants is shifting to the Fed meeting,
which is scheduled for the next week. It will take place on April 27 -
28. It is widely expected that the parameters of current monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
will remain the same. However, it is also possible that the Fed's
leaders may sound concerns about the growing inflation in the US, which
market participants may regard as a signal to reduce short positions in
the dollar.

Next week, financial market participants will pay attention to the
publication of important macro statistics from the US, Australia,
Canada, Eurozone, Germany, China, as well as the results of the meetings
of the central banks of Japan and the US. It is also worth noting that
this is the last trading week of the ending month.

 **Traders should pay attention to the publication of the following
macro indicators:**

 ***during the coming week, new events may be added to the [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) and
/ or some scheduled events may be canceled**

 ****GMT time**

###  **Monday, April 26**

###  **12:30 USD Durable goods orders. Capital goods orders (ex defense
and aviation)**

This indicator reflects the value of orders received by manufacturers of
durable goods and capital goods (capital goods are durable commodities
used to produce durable goods and services) involving large investments.
The goods produced in the defense and aviation sectors of the US economy
are not included in this indicator. A strong result strengthens the USD.
Previous values ​​of the durable goods orders indicator: -1.2% in
February, +3.4% in January 2021, +1.2% in December, +1.3% in November,
+1.8% in October , -18.3% in April, -16.7% in March, +2.0% in February,
-0.2% in January 2020.

Previous values ​​of the capital goods orders ex defense and aviation:
-0.9% in February, +0.6% in January 2021, +1.5% in December, +1.2% in
November, +1.9% in September, +2.1% in August, -6.6% in April, -1.3% in
March, -0.6% in February, +0.9% in January 2020.

In theory, the relative growth of the indicator has a positive effect on
the dollar; the market reaction to its negative value may be negative
for the dollar in the short term. Data worse than the previous value
will also negatively affect the dollar quotes.

Forecast for March: +2.5% (orders for durable goods), +1.6% (orders for
capital goods excluding defense and aviation).

It seems that the growth of indicators continues after their recovery in
previous months from a strong drop in March and April 2020, which should
have a positive effect on the dollar quotes. Better-than-expected data
will also have a positive impact on the dollar.

###  **Tuesday, April 27**

###  **03:00 JPY Bank of Japan's decision on interest rate. Bank of
Japan's press conference and monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) comments**

The Bank of Japan will decide on the interest rate. At the moment, the
main rate in Japan is in the negative territory, amounting to -0.1%.
Most likely, the rate will remain the same. If it is cut and deepens
into negative territory, such a decision will cause a sharp decline in
the yen in the foreign exchange market and an increase in the Japanese
stock market. In any case, during this period of time, a jump in
volatility is expected in trading in the yen and in the Asian financial
market.

Since February 2016, the Bank of Japan has kept the deposit rate at
-0.1%. The target yield for 10-year bonds is currently around 0%. In
2020, the Bank of Japan set an annual target for [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/) purchases of 12
trillion yen and expanded its aid program for coronavirus-affected
businesses to 110 trillion yen from 75 trillion yen. Under this program,
companies can obtain unsecured loans at zero interest rates. The goal of
the program is to support commercial companies whose bankruptcy rates
have skyrocketed in Japan in recent months due to the coronavirus
pandemic. A recent accompanying statement from the Bank of Japan said
that the bank's management will continue to "increase the monetary base
until inflation stays above 2%." “We will not hesitate to take
additional mitigation measures if necessary,” the bank also
traditionally said in a statement.

During the press conference, the head of the Bank of Japan Haruhiko
Kuroda will comment on the bank's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). The Bank of Japan
continues to adhere to its super-soft monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). As Kuroda has
stated on several occasions, "it is appropriate for Japan to patiently
continue with its current loose monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)." Markets usually react
noticeably to Kuroda's speeches. Surely, he will again touch upon the
topic of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) during his speech, which will cause an increase
in volatility not only in the yen trade, but also throughout the Asian
and world financial markets.

If the bank's executives decide that Japan's economy is stable and the
momentum of inflation towards the 2% target is not diminishing, they
will refrain from changing [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).

###  **06:00 JPY** **Press conference of the Bank of Japan**

During the press conference, the head of the Bank of Japan Haruhiko
Kuroda will comment on the bank's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). Despite the measures
taken earlier by the bank to stimulate the Japanese economy, inflation
remains low, production and consumption are falling, which negatively
affects export-oriented Japanese manufacturers. Markets usually react
noticeably to Kuroda's speeches. If he touches on the topic of monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) during his speech, volatility will increase not only in the yen
trade, but throughout the Asian and global financial markets.

###  **20:00 CAD Speech by Governor of the Bank of Canada Tiff Macklem**

The Canadian economy, as well as the entire global economy, slowed down
in 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic. Earlier, Tiff Macklem said that
the Canadian economy is quite stable. However, the situation has changed
rapidly, and not for the better. Traders want to know Macklem's opinion
on the sustainability of the Canadian economy and the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of
the central bank.

If Tiff Macklem touches on the topic of the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the Bank
of Canada, the volatility in the quotes of the Canadian dollar will rise
sharply. His tough tone will help strengthen the Canadian dollar. The
soft rhetoric of Tief Maclem's speech and the propensity for soft
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) will negatively affect the CAD quotes.

He will probably also touch on the topic of the last week's meeting, at
which the leaders of the Bank of Canada left the key interest rate
unchanged at 0.25%, while saying that the key rate hike could happen
faster than previously thought, and also unexpectedly announced a
slowdown in bond purchases due to improved economic outlook.

###  **Wednesday, April 28**

###  **01:30 AUD RBA core trimmed mean inflation index (for the 1st
quarter). Consumer Price Index (for the 1st quarter)**

This indicator is published by the RBA and the Australian Bureau of
Statistics. It reflects the dynamics of retail prices of goods and
services included in the consumer basket. The simple trimmed mean method
takes into account the weighted average kernel, the central 70% of the
index components. Previous values ​​of the index: +0.4% (+1.2% in annual
[terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) in the 4th quarter of 2020. According to the forecast, it is
expected that the value of the indicator for the 1st quarter of 2021
will also be +0.5% (+1.2% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)). If the value of the
indicator coincides with the forecast or turns out to be worse than it,
it is likely to negatively affect the AUD. The data indicate low
inflationary pressures in the country. The growth of the indicator above
the forecast should have a positive effect on the AUD in the short term.

Consumer Price Inflation Index (CPI) published by the RBA and the
Australian Bureau of Statistics measures the dynamics of retail prices
for goods and services in Australia. CPI is the most significant
indicator of inflation and changes in consumer preferences. A high
reading is positive for the AUD, while a low reading is negative.
Previous values ​​of the indicator: +0.9% (+0.9% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) in the
4th quarter of 2020. According to the forecast, it is expected that the
value of the indicator for the 1st quarter of 2021 will be +0.9% (+1.4%
in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)). The expected positive value is unlikely to provide
significant support for the AUD, indicating low inflationary pressures
in the Australian economy. If the indicator comes out with a value worse
than expected, it is likely to put pressure on the AUD.

###  **12:30 CAD Retail Sales Index**

Retail Sales Index is published monthly by Statistics Canada and
estimates total retail sales. The index is often considered an indicator
of consumer confidence and reflects the health of the retail sector in
the near term. A rise in the index is usually positive for the CAD; a
decrease in the indicator will negatively affect the CAD. The previous
value of the index (in January) was -1.1% after falling in March 2020 by
-9.9%, in April - by -25% and growth in May by +18.7%. If the data for
February turns out to be even weaker than the forecast of -3.0%, which
is even worse than the previous negative value, the CAD may sharply
decline in the short term.

###  **14:00 EUR Speech by the ECB President Christine Lagarde**

During speeches by the head of the ECB Christine Lagarde, the volatility
of trading increases not only in the euro and European stock indices,
but throughout the financial market, especially if she touches on the
topic of the ECB's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). Any hints at curtailing the QE
program in the Eurozone will cause the euro to rise. The soft tone of
Christine Lagarde's speech and the propensity to continue the extra soft
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the ECB will negatively affect the euro.

Speeches of the head of the ECB after the bank's meetings have a
particularly strong influence on the market. In previous periods, the
speech of the head of the ECB in similar situations could cause a change
in the euro exchange rate by more than 3%. If Christine Lagarde does not
touch upon the topic of the ECB's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), the reaction to her
speech will be weak.

###  **18:00 USD The Fed's decision on the interest rate. The Fed's
comments on monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)**

In March 2020, the Fed sharply lowered the interest rate (to 0.25% from
1.75% in February), and also announced the allocation of $700 billion
for the purchase of US government bonds and mortgage-backed securities.
Subsequently, the Fed has repeatedly announced additional measures to
support the American economy and inject cheap liquidity into the
financial system. Usually, with the easing of the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), the
national currency becomes cheaper and its quotations go down.

In 2020, the dollar declined as [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s withdrew funds from defensive
assets, buying more risky and profitable assets of the stock market,
which continued to grow despite the threat of a second wave of the
coronavirus epidemic and the associated economic slowdown. The role of
the dollar as a defensive asset was also declining. However, in 2021,
the dollar is strengthening, which is associated with an increase in the
yield of US government bonds, and the Fed has not yet responded to this
in any way.

The rate is widely expected to remain at 0.25% at this meeting.
Nevertheless, during the period of publication of the decision on the
rate, volatility may sharply grow throughout the financial market,
primarily in the American stock market and in the dollar quotes,
especially if the decision on the rate differs from the forecast or
unexpected statements are received from the Fed leaders.

Powell's comments may affect both short-term and long-term USD trading.
A more hawkish stance on the Fed's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) is seen as positive
and strengthens the US dollar, while a more cautious stance is seen as
negative for the USD. Investors are eager to hear Powell's views on the
Fed's future plans this year.

###  **18:30 USD FOMC Press Conference**

The press conference of the US Federal Open Market Committee lasts about
an hour. The first part contains the reading of the ruling, followed by
a series of questions and answers that can increase market volatility.
Any hints by Powell about the possibility of a change in the current
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) will cause an increase in volatility in the dollar
quotes and in the American stock market.

###  **Thursday, April 29**

###  **12:00 EUR Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) in Germany
(preliminary release)**

This index is published by the EU Statistical Office and is calculated
on the basis of a statistical method agreed between all EU countries. It
is an indicator for assessing inflation and is used by the Governing
Council of the ECB to assess the level of price stability. A positive
result strengthens the EUR, a negative one weakens it.

Preliminary forecast for April: +2.0% (against +2.0% in March, +1.6% in
January and February, -0.7% in December and negative values ​​in the
second half of 2020) on an annualized basis. If the data turn out to be
better than the forecast, the euro may strengthen in the short term. The
growth of the indicator is a positive factor for the euro. The data show
that inflationary pressures are still low in Germany. The data worse
than the forecast and the previous value will negatively affect the
euro.

###  **12:30 USD Annual US GDP for the 1st quarter (preliminary
estimate)**

GDP data is one of the key indicators (along with data on the labor
market and inflation) for the Fed in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of its monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).
Strong result strengthens the US dollar; weak GDP report negatively
affects the US dollar. In the previous 4th quarter, GDP grew by +4.3%
after rising +33.4% in Q3 2020, and after falling -31.4% in Q2 and -5.0%
in Q1 2020.

If the data points to a decline in GDP in the 4th quarter, the dollar
will come under pressure. The positive data on GDP will support the
dollar and the American stock indices, although they are already mostly
priced in. Preliminary forecast for Q1 2021: +6.5%.

###  **Friday, April 30**

###  **01:00 CNY Services PMI by China Federation of Logistics &
Purchasing (CFLP)**

This indicator assesses the state of the services sector in the Chinese
economy. A result above 50 is considered positive and strengthens the
yuan. Previous values of the indicator: 56.3 in March, 51.4 in February,
52.4 in January. The indicator is above 50, which is likely to have a
positive effect on the yuan quotes, even with a slight relative decline.
If the indicator is below 50, the yuan will be under pressure and likely
to decline. Forecast for April: 52.6.

###  **01:00 CNY Manufacturing PMI by China Federation of Logistics &
Purchasing (CFLP)**

This indicator is an important indicator of the state of the Chinese
economy as a whole. A result above 50 is seen as positive and
strengthens the CNY, one below 50 as negative for the yuan. Previous
values ​​of the indicator: 51.9 in March, 50.6 in February, 51.3 in
January.

The relative growth of the index and the value above 50 should have a
positive effect on the CNY. The data above the value of 50 indicates an
increase in activity, which has a positive effect on the quotes of the
national currency. In the opposite case, and if the indicator is below
50, the yuan will be under pressure and probably will decrease. Forecast
for April: 51.4.

###  **06:00 EUR Germany GDP for the 1st quarter (preliminary release)**

GDP is considered the most important indicator of the overall health of
the economy. The growing trend in the GDP indicator is considered
positive for the national currency. The German economy is the locomotive
of the entire European economy. A high value of the GDP indicator is
considered a positive factor for the EUR, while a low value is
considered negative.

The growth of the European and German economies slowed sharply in 2019,
and in 2020 the European economy has already entered a recession.
Although the Brexit problem has finally been resolved, the risk of
negative impact on the economy of the consequences of the coronavirus
pandemic has been added to the internal political risks in Europe.

If the GDP data turns out to be weaker than the forecast, it will put
downward pressure on the euro. Better-than-expected data may strengthen
the euro. Forecast: German GDP grew by +0.3% in the 1st quarter of 2021,
but decreased by -2.8% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/).

###  **08:00 CHF Speech by the head of the SNB Thomas Jordan**

During the speech by SNB Chairman Thomas Jordan, the volatility of CHF
trading increases, and traders are waiting for signals regarding the
further plans of the SNB's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). The central bank of
Switzerland has consistently advocated a soft monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) in the
country, and traditionally considers the rate of the national currency
"overvalued". Jordan’s tough rhetoric will strengthen the franc. The
soft tone of the speech and the propensity to continue the extra soft
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the SNB will negatively affect the franc. If Jordan
does not touch on the topic of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), the reaction to his
speech will be weak.

###  **09:00 EUR Eurozone GDP for the 1st quarter (preliminary
estimate). Consumer Price Index. Core Consumer Price Index (prelliminary
release)**

GDP is considered to be an indicator of the overall health of the
economy. The upward trend in GDP is considered positive for the EUR; a
poor result weakens the EUR.

Recently, macro data from the Eurozone have been indicating a gradual
recovery in the growth rate of the European economy after a sharp drop
in early 2020. However, the decision made by the EU leaders in July to
provide additional support to the economy (a package of spending on the
economic recovery of the bloc in the amount of 1.8 trillion euros was
approved) will help stabilize the economy of the Eurozone, which, as a
result of quarantine restrictions, restraint in spending by companies
and consumers, as well as a collapse exports is on the cusp of the
deepest economic downturn since World War II.

The euro reacted positively to this decision.

Nevertheless, according to the forecast of economists, the GDP of the
Eurozone is expected to fall in the 1st quarter of 2021 by -0.8% (by
-1.9% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) after falling by -0.7% (-4.9% in annualized) in
the 4th quarter of 2020, an increase of +12.5% ​​(a fall of -4.3% in
annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) in the 3rd quarter, a fall of -11.8% (-14.7% in YoY) in
the 2nd quarter and a decline of -3.6% (-3.1% YoY) in the 1st quarter of
2020.

If the data turn out to be weaker than the preliminary estimate, the
euro may decline. Better-than-forecast data may strengthen the euro in
the short term, although it is still far from the full recovery of the
European economy even to pre-crisis levels (quarterly growth within 0.2%
- 0.4%).

Consumer Price Index (CPI) is published by Eurostat and measures the
price change of a selected basket of goods and services over a given
period. The index is a key indicator for assessing inflation and changes
in purchasing habits. A positive result strengthens the EUR, a negative
one weakens it. At the end of 2020, the CPI index fell by -0.3%, which
indicates low inflationary pressures and even a slowdown in inflation.
Forecast for April: +1.6% (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) against +1.3% in March,
+0.9% in January and February. If the data turns out to be worse than
the forecast, the euro may drop sharply in the short term. The data
better than the forecast and / or the previous value may strengthen the
euro in the short term, despite the low value (the target level of the
ECB's consumer inflation is just below 2.0%).

Core Consumer Price Index (Core CPI) determines the change in prices of
a selected basket of goods and services for a given period and is a key
indicator for assessing inflation and changes in consumer preferences.
Food and energy have been excluded from this indicator to provide a more
accurate estimate. A high result strengthens the EUR, while a low result
weakens it. In January 2021, Core CPI rose +1.4%, +1.1% in February (on
an annualized basis) after more modest values ​​of +0.2% between
September and December 2020. If the data for April turn out to be worse
than the previous value or forecast, this may negatively affect the
euro. If the data turn out to be better than the forecast or the
previous value, the euro is likely to react with an increase in
quotations, but only in the short term. Inflation in the Eurozone
remains low, which is a negative factor for the euro. Forecast for
April: +0.9%.
