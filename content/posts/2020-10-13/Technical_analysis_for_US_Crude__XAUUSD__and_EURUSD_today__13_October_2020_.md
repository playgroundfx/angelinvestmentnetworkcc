Short-term forecast for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 13.10.2020Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my colleagues! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for day traders.

The Gold medium-term downtrend continues. The price is approaching the
key resistance [1951.0 — 1941.7].

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

Oil is trading in the middle-term uptrend. The price is rolling back
from the strong resistance [41.67 – 40.92]. Unless the price breaks out
the resistance, the market should go down to the key support [37.34 —
36.72].

The short-term oil trend is up. The price is being corrected down now.

The price broke out the strong support Additional Zone [40.13 – 40.00].
The market is likely to go down to Intermediary Zone [38.85 – 38.60].

When IZ is tested, I suggest entering oil purchases with the target at
the high of this week. We need a buy pattern to enter purchases.

### [USCrude ][1]trading ideas for today:

Buy according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone [38.85 - 38.60].
TakeProfit: 41.35, Target Zone [42.56 - 42.01]. StopLoss: according to
the pattern rules.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

The Gold medium-term downtrend continues. The price is approaching the
key resistance [1951.0 – 1941.7]. After the resistance is tested, I
suggest entering sell trades according to the pattern.

The local short-term gold trend is up. The price is now being corrected
down, following the price rise last week. The correction target is
Additional Zone [1906.9 – 1904.3].

After AZ is tested, we shall enter buy trades according to the pattern.
The target will be at yesterday’s high + the upper Target Zone [1951.0 –
1941.7].

If AZ is broken out, and the price consolidates below the zone, there
will be a deep correction down to Intermediary Zone [1880.7 — 1875.4].

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

  1. Buy according to the pattern in Additional Zone [1906.9 - 1904.3]. TakeProfit: Target Zone [1951.0 - 1941.7]. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. Buy according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone [1880.7 - 1875.4]. TakeProfit: Target Zone [1951.0 - 1941.7]. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

After the EURUSD reached the key resistance of the middle-term downtrend
[1.1832 – 1.1812], the price is rolling down. This week, look for a sell
setup with a downside target in Target Zone 2 [1.1611 — 1.1591].

Let us switch to a shorter timeframe and analyze the short-term euro
trend.

The EURUSD is trading up. The price has reached Target Zone [1.1832 –
1.1812]. The market is testing the strong support Additional Zone
[1.1781 - 1.1776]. I suggest looking for a buy pattern and buy the euro
with a target at the high of October 9.

It will be relevant to sell the euro-dollar after the price breaks out
Additional Zone and consolidates below. In this case, the downside
target will be the trend key support [1.1731 - 1.1721].

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

  1. Buy according to the pattern in Additional Zone [1.1781 - 1.1776]. TakeProfit: 1.1830. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. Buy according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone [1.1731 - 1.1721]. TakeProfit: 1.1830. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.
