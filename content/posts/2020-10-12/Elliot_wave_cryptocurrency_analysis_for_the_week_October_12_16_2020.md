Medium-term forecast for five cryptocurrencies as of 12.10.2020Roman
Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a medium-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, EOS, and Ripple. I offer
trading signals for each cryptocurrency pair.

All the major cryptocurrencies should finish rising in the first days of
the treading week. Next, the cryptocurrency market should turn down and
start declining.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

In the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) BTCUSD price chart, there is developing the corrective wave
4 as a double zigzag [W]-[X]-[Y]. The first leg of the double
combination, sub-wave [W], has completed. There is now unfolding the
linking wave [X] as a double zigzag (W)-(X)-(Y) of a smaller degree.
There is now forming the (Y) wave, it is composed of the sub-waves
A-B-C. The price should be declining in the B correction towards a level
of 9160, where the B wave will be 38.2% Fibonacci ratio of the A
impulse. Next, the market should be rising in the C impulse and break
through the previous high, which could be made by the linking wave [x],
as it is outlined in the chart. Let us see the structure of the (Y) wave
in the H8 timeframe.

The impulse wave A has completed. There is now forming the corrective
wave B as a double zigzag [W]-[X]-[Y]. When the sub-wave [W] finished,
the bullish linking wave [X] started forming; it is made of the sub-
waves (W)-(X)-(Y). There is now should be developing the final impulse
wave с of (Y), it should finish at a level of around 11760. Next, the
market could turn down and start declining in wave [Y], as it is
outlined in the chart.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] for the week:

Sell 11760.00, TP 9825.00

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

The Ethereum continues forming the upward linking wave [X] that is a
triple zigzag. The first three legs of this triple zigzag have
completed. The market is now declining in the second linking wave (X). I
drew a channel across the tops of (W), (X), and (Y). Wave (X) should end
at a level of 157.00, as it is outlined in the chart. This level is at
the support level of the channel. Let us see the structure of the
zigzag-shaped wave (X) in the H8 timeframe.

The bear impulse wave A has finished in the simple descending zigzag
A-B-C. There is now forming the corrective wave B as a double zigzag
[W]-[X]-[Y]. The price should be rising in the (c) impulse towards the
level of 393.00, which is the previous high. Next, the market could turn
down and start declining towards a level of 157.00.

### Trading plan **[ETHUSD][2] **for the week:

Sell 393.00, TP 307.00

##  **Elliott wave Litecoin analysis**

The LTCUSD market continues forming the down corrective wave B that is
composed of the triple combination of zigzags. The [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) chart displays
the final wave [Z] developing as a simple zigzag (A)-(B)-(C). There have
completed the (A) impulse and the (B) correction, and the impulse wave
(C) is still forming. Let us see its structure in a shorter timeframe.

The bear impulse wave (C) is composed of five sub-waves 1-2-3-4-5. The
first three legs have ended, and the bullish correction 4 is still
forming. It is a simple zigzag, and the market is currently forming the
final impulse [c] of 4, which should end at a level of 52.40. Next, the
market could turn down and start declining in wave 5 towards a level of
25.00, which is the low made by impulse wave (A).

### Trading plan for **[LTCUSD][3]**  for the week:

Sell 52.40, TP 41.50

##  **Elliott wave EOS analysis**

Like in the previous trading week, the market is forming the corrective
wave B as a triple zigzag [W]-[X]-[Y]-[X]-[Z]. The first four legs
should have completed, and the final leg, wave [Z], is yet unfolding.
Wave [Z] is forming as a simple zigzag composed of three sub-waves
(A)-(B)-(C). The entire B correction must end at a level close to the
previous low made by wave [Y], level 1.40. Let us see the structure of
the [Z] wave in the eight-hour timeframe.

There is now forming the corrective wave (B) in the zigzag [Z]. This
correction is also a zigzag A-B-C. The sub-waves A and B have completed,
and there is now forming the impulse wave C, namely, its final leg [5].
The market should be rising in wave [5] towards a level of 2.96, next,
the market could start declining in the impulse wave (C) towards the
previous low, level 1.40.

### Trading plan for **[EOSUSD][4]**  for the week

Sell 2.96, TP 2.40

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

The XRPUSD market continues forming the triple zigzag
[W]-[X]-[Y]-[X]-[Z]. There is now forming the bear zigzag-shaped wave
[Z] composed of the sub-waves (A)-(B)-(C). The impulse wave (A) looks
complete, and the bullish correction (B) is about to finish soon. Let us
see the most recent chart section in the eight-hour timeframe.

When the five-wave impulse (A) finished, the market has started forming
the corrective wave (B) as a standard zigzag A-B-C. The corrective wave
should soon complete at a level of around 0.266. Next, the price could
start declining in the (C) wave to a level below the previous low, made
by wave (A). The market should be moving down to a level of 0.110, as is
outlined in the chart.

### Trading plan for **[XRPUSD][5]** for the week:

Sell 0.266, TP 0.217
