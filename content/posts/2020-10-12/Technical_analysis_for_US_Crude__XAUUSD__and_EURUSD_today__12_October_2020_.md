Short-term forecast for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 12.10.2020Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my colleagues! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for day traders.

Euro has reached the key resistance of the medium-term downtrend, Target
Zone [1.1832 — 1.1812].

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

Oil is trading in the medium-term uptrend, going back from the strong
resistance [41.67 – 40.92]. Unless the price breaks out the resistance,
the market should go down to the key support [37.34 — 36.72].

Let us switch to a shorter timeframe to analyze the short-term trend.
Oil is trading up. Last week, the price tested the strong support
Additional Zone [39.38 - 39.24]. Next, the price grew and broke through
the local high.

The market is again being corrected down and testing the new Additional
Zone [40.13 – 40.00]. I recommend entering purchases in the zone
according to the pattern. The target is to break through the high and to
test Target Zone [42.56 — 42.01].

### [USCrude ][1]trading ideas for today:

  1. Buy according to the pattern in  Additional Zone [40.13 - 40.00]. TakeProfit: 41.35, Target Zone [42.56 - 42.01]. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. Buy according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone [38.85 - 38.60]. TakeProfit: 41.35, Target Zone [42.56 - 42.01]. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

The Gold medium-term downtrend continues. The price is approaching the
key resistance [1951.0 – 1941.7]. After the resistance is tested, I
suggest entering sell trades according to the pattern.

The short-term gold trend is up. The trend target is Target Zone [1951.0
– 1941.7]. Last week, the price broke out Additional Zone [1901.8 -
1899.2] and hit a new local high. Today, I suggest entering
purchases/holding up existing buy trades.

Strong supports are Additional Zone [1906.9 - 1904.3] and Intermediary
Zone [1880.7 - 1875.4]. Expect correction down to these zones and look
for a buy pattern.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

  1. Buy according to the pattern in Additional Zone [1906.9 - 1904.3]. TakeProfit: Target Zone [1951.0 - 1941.7]. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. Buy according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone [1880.7 - 1875.4]. TakeProfit: Target Zone [1951.0 - 1941.7]. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

The eurusd has reached the key resistance of the middle-term downtrend,
Target Zone [1.1832 - 1.1812]. This week, look for a sell setup with a
downside target in Target Zone 2 [1.1611 — 1.1591].

The main target in the short-term uptrend has been reached. The price
reached Target Zone [1.1832 – 1.1812]. One should close all buy
positions and be ready for a possible correction.

If there is a correction down, we should enter buy trades according to
the pattern in the support zones, Additional Zone [1.1781 - 1.1776] and
Intermediary Zone [1.1731 – 1.1721]. The target will be around the local
high.

It will be relevant to sell the euro if the short-term trend turns down.
I don’t consider this scenario yet.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

  1. Buy according to the pattern in Additional Zone [1.1781 - 1.1776]. TakeProfit: 1.1830. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. Buy according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone [1.1731 - 1.1721]. TakeProfit: 1.1830. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.
