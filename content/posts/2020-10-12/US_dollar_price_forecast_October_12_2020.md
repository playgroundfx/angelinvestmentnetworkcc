Dollar follows the stock market. Forecast as of 12.10.2020Dmitri
Demidenko

Joe Biden’s rating is growing, and the uncertainty around the US
presidential election is easing. The US stock indexes are rising, which
weakens the US dollar. Let us discuss the dollar outlook and make up a
[EURUSD][1] trading plan.

##  ** **Weekly** **US dollar** **fundamental forecast****

The ECB attempts to weaken the euro fail. Philip Lane says the ECB
already pursues an inflation strategy similar to the Fed. The European
Central Bank is unwilling to tighten monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) until the inflation
growth is reflected in the economic data. Nonetheless, the [EURUSD][1]
doesn’t react to the ECB’s chief economist's speech and consolidates
above figure 18 bottom. According to the HSBC, fiscal [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) is
currently the main factor in the financial markets, and central banks
must admit that they have lost some power.

Although the United States has invested in its economy more money than
most other countries in the world and significantly more than during the
previous economic crisis, the fiscal stimulus tends to exhaust quickly.
The euro-area governments continue to support small businesses and
individuals, while the US [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers can’t reach an agreement on its
extension. The new $1.8 trillion stimulus plan offered by the
Republicans is the largest in scale and contrasts with Donald Trump's
recent announcement to end negotiations with Democrats. However, House
Speaker Nancy Pelosi rejects it, calling the plan insufficient.

Some analysts suggested the new Republican proposal fueled the rally of
the US stock indexes. The [S&P 500][2] was 3.8% up in the week through
October 9, having featured the best performance since July. I believe
the US stock market is rising as the uncertainty around the US
presidential election is lowering. Joe Biden’s chance to win is rising,
and his victory shouldn't be such a disaster for the US stock indexes as
expected earlier.

According to RealClearPolitics, the gap between Biden and Trump is 9.6
percentage points. For comparison, in 2016, Hillary Clinton was 5.8 pp
ahead of Donald Trump three weeks before the vote. JP Morgan suggests
the corporate tax hike in the case of Joe Biden's victory will
temporarily hinder the US stock market. The higher tax rate will take
effect on January 1, 2022, and the [S&P 500][2] is likely to face a
storm in the fourth quarter of 2021. However, as the experience of 1987
and 2013 shows, when taxes were also increased, the storm would not last
long. After the correction, the bulls should resume the uptrend.

I believe the US stock market trend is a significant driver for the
[EURUSD][1]. Ahead of the US presidential election, the pair follows the
US stock indexes, mostly ignoring the ECB verbal interventions, the
second COVID-19 wave, and the euro-area economic data.

###  **Weekly[EURUSD][1] trading plan**

The US dollar is a more significant Forex currency than the euro, so the
ECB willingness to weaken the euro alone is not enough to discourage the
EURUSD bulls. Amid the growth of Joe Biden's approval rating, the
[EURUSD][1] should continue rallying up to 1.1865-1.188. However, Donald
Trump is not giving up yet, so one could sell on the price rise.
