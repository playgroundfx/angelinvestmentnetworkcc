Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 12.10.2020Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I suggest entry signals
to trade each cryptocurrency.

The BTCUSD is to be rising in the final impulse (5) that has just
started. SO, it is relevant tot enter purchases.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

 ****

The BTCUSD market is forming a bear trend. The trend must be unfolding
as a double zigzag. After the down zigzag-shaped wave [W] finished, the
market has been rising in the linking wave [X] that is also a double
zigzag (W)-(X)-(Y). Wave (Y) is about to end soon. The price should be
rising in the impulse wave (5) of [c] to a level of 11760.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 11397.75, TP 11760.00

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

 ****

The XRPUSD market continues forming the down simple zigzag A-B-C. In the
most recent section of the chart, the impulse wave A has finished, and
the price is rising in the corrective wave B that may complete as a
simple zigzag. The first two parts of this zigzag have completed, and
the impulse wave [c] is yet unfolding. The price should be rising in
impulse 5 towards a level of 0.266.

### Trading plan for **[XRPUSD][2]** today:

Buy 0.254, TP 0.266

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

 ****

After the bear impulse wave [1] finished, there has started the bearish
corrective wave [2] that is developing as a zigzag (A)-(B)-(C). The
waves (A) and (B) have finished. Wave (A) is a simple five-waves
impulse, the corrective wave (B) is a simple zigzag a-b-c. There is now
should finish the motive wave (C) as an impulse composed of five sub-
waves 1-2-3-4-5. The market should be growing in wave (C) towards a
level of 393.00, which is the previous high made by the correction B.
