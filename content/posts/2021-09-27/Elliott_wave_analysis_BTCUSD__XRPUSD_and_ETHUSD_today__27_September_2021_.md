Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 27.09.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

All cryptocurrency pairs covered in the article must complete impulse
sub-waves in bullish corrections. The downtrends will continue
afterwards.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

The BTCUSD market is forming the initial part of the bullish wave as an
impulse. Sub-waves (1)-(2) have finished, and the third wave is
currently unfolding. In the third wave, which is an impulse, the first
leg, impulse 1, has finished. There is unfolding correction 2 as a
zigzag [A]-[B]-[C]. This zigzag should soon end, and the price will
continue falling in impulse 3 to a level below 39500.00, marked by wave
1.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Sell 44062.79, TP 39500.00

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

The XRPUSD market is declining in the new bearish wave, unfolding as an
impulse. Impulse wave [1] has recently completed; it is composed of sub-
waves (1)-(2)-(3)-(4)-(5). Next, the market has started rising in
correction [2]. Correction [2] must finish soon as a zigzag (A)-(B)-(C).
Next, the market will turn down and continue declining to a level below
0.805, marked by wave [1].

recent chart section displays the beginning of the third wave, with the
bearish wave [1] completed inside. There is unfolding the upward
correction [2] as a zigzag (A)-(B)-(C), which should end soon, After
wave [2] finishes, the market should turn down and continue declining to
