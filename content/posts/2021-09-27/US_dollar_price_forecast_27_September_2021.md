Dollar: chicken or egg? Forecast as of 27.09.2021Dmitri Demidenko

Investors shift their focus from central banks to politics. Monetary
normalization is not an important topic anymore. Markets are interested
in the issues of the US debt ceiling and default. Let us discuss the
Forex outlook and make up a [EURUSD][1] trading plan.

## Weekly US dollar fundamental forecast

The main problem of financial markets is not China with its Evergrande
and the energy crisis, not the Fed with its monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
normalization, but its overconfidence. When in 2019 the inverted yield
curve signaled an approaching recession, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s ignored the bond
market's signals. As a result, the pandemic resulted in the stock
indexes crash and economic recession. Something like this could happen
this autumn. Based on the [S&P 500][2] trend, the market is
overconfident about the US debt ceiling. Investors do not consider the
risks of default, although they should.

Government funding expires on October 1, leading to a partial government
shutdown if Congress doesn't take action. Republicans in the Senate are
poised to block the plan to suspend the public debt ceiling until
December 2022, approved by the House. By mid-October, the Treasury will
run out of funds, and the problem of default will hang over the States.
The one that has not happened in [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/), the consequences of which for
financial markets are unpredictable.

In this respect, the confidence of stock markets is surprising.
Investors continue buying out the stocks, seeing no other alternatives.
Investors use the fuss around Evergrande, Fed's monetary normalization,
and the US potential default as a reason to enter longs on the
correction. Nevertheless, the Fed should start QE tapering in November,
and the Chinese real estate giant could not pay its debts on September
23. Why are the markets growing, strengthening the [EURUSD][1]?

### Evergrande timing of payments

The matter is [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s' overconfidence. Beijing will not allow the
problem of Evergrande to affect China's economy. Congress, having
already raised the government debt ceiling 98 times, will not allow the
US to default. The Fed will not allow panic in the financial markets.
One worry this time is a game of chicken and eggs in which markets stay
placid because they assume Congress will act. However, lawmakers don't
act because they see no alarm in markets; they do not make crucial
decisions for the US and global economies.

In 2013, the Federal Reserve considered ways to respond to the US
failure to fulfill its obligations. These included buying Treasuries in
the open market and selling them off the central bank's balance sheet.
The current Fed Chairman, Jerome Powell, called some of the measures
disgusting others - beyond the norm. First, they violate the regulator's
principle of avoiding direct government funding; second, they reassure
congressmen. If the latter do not suspend the national debt ceiling, the
Fed will come and offer a solution. However, during his last speech,
Powell has noted that one should not think that the Fed or anyone else
will be able to fully protect the economy and markets in case of
failure.

### Weekly [EURUSD][1] trading plan

The stock market is placid, and this could crash both the [S&P 500][2]
and [EURUSD][1]. The EURUSD is trading in the consolidation range of
1.168 - 1.175, whose breakout will determine the further price movement.
The pair could start a correction up to 1.179 and 1.182 or continue
declining towards 1.1615 and 1.1555.
