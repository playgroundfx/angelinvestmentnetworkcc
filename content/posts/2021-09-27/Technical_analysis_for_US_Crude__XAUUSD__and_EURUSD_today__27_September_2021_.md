Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 27.09.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

Gold went into correction and reached the Intermediary Zone 1760 - 1758.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

Oil trades opened with a gap and the price immediately hit the next
target within a short-term uptrend: the Gold Zone 75.12 - 74.87. This
zone slows down further price growth and serves as a strong resistance
level.

Today, wait for the price correction and the closing of the gap. The gap
will be closed in the Additional Zone 73.90 - 73.77. After reaching this
zone, it will be possible to search for new purchases with a target at
the day's high.

The trend key support is shifting to the zone of 72.63 - 72.37.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

Buy according to the pattern in Additional Zone 73.90 - 73.77.
TakeProfit: 75.12. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

Gold went into correction and reached the Intermediary Zone 1760 - 1758.
The Intermediary Zone serves as the short-term downtrend's key
resistance. If the price does not break out the IZ, then the price is
likely to retest the Target Zone 1746 - 1741. Thus, today it is
profitable to look for sales in the resistance zone.

If the Intermediary Zone is broken out and the price closes higher at
the US session, then the short-term trend will reverse up. In this case,
start searching for gold purchases. The target for purchases will be the
upper Target Zone 1783 - 1779.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

Sell according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 1760 - 1758.
TakeProfit: Target Zone 1746 - 1741. StopLoss: according to the pattern
rules.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

Last week on Thursday and Friday, traders were trying to break out the
short-term downtrend's key resistance 1.1744, but unsuccessful. On
Friday, the price moved away from the level of 1.1744 and returned to
the Additional Zone 1.1732 - 1.1727.

The chart shows the development of the accumulation zone, while the
traders are preparing for a further fall. In this regard, I propose to
consider entering sales at current prices 1.1725 - 1.1715 with the first
target at level 1.1687.

To enter euro purchases, the price must be consolidated above the level
of 1.1744.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

Sell according to the pattern in the zone of 1.1725 - 1.1715.
TakeProfit: 1.1687. StopLoss: 1.1735.
