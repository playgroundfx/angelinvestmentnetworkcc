Gold: between hammer and anvil. Forecast as of 27.09.2021Dmitri
Demidenko

The Fed triggered a significant shift in the debt, currency, and
commodity markets by announcing an imminent start of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
normalization. What are the risks of XAU? Let us analyze the gold
outlook and make up a trading plan.

## Monthly gold fundamental forecast

The Fed triggered a major shift in financial markets by announcing that
the QE tapering could begin as early as November. Rumors about the
imminent withdrawal of monetary stimulus proved to be quite painful for
dollar sellers, as well as buyers of Treasury bonds and gold. Greenback
strengthened, the yield on 10-year Treasuries left the trading range of
1.25 - 1.37%, in which it stayed for almost two months, and the gold
price fell.

When the economy returns to its normal state, it is time to normalize
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). In accordance with this, Norges Bank was one of the
first among the G10 to raise the main interest rate. Others, including
the Fed, are ready to follow its path. It does not matter that economic
growth in the United States most likely peaked in the second quarter. In
the future, GDP expansion will be pre-pandemic, and this is a strong
argument in favor of QE tapering and raising the federal funds rate in
2022.

Investors, hoping for a return of economic growth rates to normal
levels, are more actively selling long-term Treasury bonds, which leads
to a fall in the yield curve for 5 and 30-year securities. Such dynamics
are typical for the QE tapering phase, and as [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) shows, it is a
bearish factor for [EURUSD][1]. The fall of the main currency pair's
price is bad [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) for gold.

### Dynamics of the US bond yield spread

Markets saw signs of growing concerns of central bank officials about
the long-term nature of high inflation at the FOMC meeting. In September
2020, the Fed predicted a PCE of 1.8% in 2022. Since then, these
estimates have been regularly raised and reached 2.3%. At first glance,
the level is not very high, but it is a record for the next 12 months
since the publication of such forecasts began in 2007. Six Committee
members predict the inflation next year at 2.5%.

The normalization of the Fed's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) and the threat of a long-
term high level of the PCE index is a strong argument favoring Treasury
sales. The rise in Treasury profitability is a serious headwind for non-
interest-bearing gold. The situation may worsen even more after Congress
suspends the government debt ceiling until December 2022 in order to
prevent a default. Debt issuance will return to early 2021 levels, and
the volume of asset purchases by the Fed will begin to decline. The
withdrawal of the largest buyer from the market against the background
of an increase in supply is a reason to sell securities, which will deal
another blow to [XAUUSD][2] bulls.

### Monthly gold trading plan

Thus, gold will continue to be between hammer and anvil. The growth of
Treasury bond yields and the US dollar is likely to continue. This
allows entering gold sales. Hold the short trades formed [at the levels
of][3] $1806 and $1792 with [targets at][4] $1715 and $1665 and add up
on the breakout of support at $1740 per ounce.
