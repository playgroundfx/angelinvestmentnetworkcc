USDCAD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 29.01.21 – 05.02.21Alex
Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 1.2951 with a target of 1.2450 – 1.2300.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
1.2951 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 1.3074 –
1.3376.

 **Analysis:** Daily time frame: wave (С) of 4 of larger degree
continues developing, with the first wave 1 of (C) forming inside.
Presumably, the fifth wave v of 1 of (C) is forming on the H4 time
frame. Wave (iii) of v of smaller degree has formed and correction is
developing in the form of wave (iv) of v as part of the fifth wave v of
1 of (C). Apparently, the ultimate wave с of (iv) is forming on the H1
time frame. If this assumption is correct, the pair will continue to
fall to the levels of 1.2450 – 1.2300 once the correction’s over. The
level of 1.2951 is critical in this scenario, as the breakout will
enable the pair to continue rising to the levels of 1.3074 – 1.3376.
