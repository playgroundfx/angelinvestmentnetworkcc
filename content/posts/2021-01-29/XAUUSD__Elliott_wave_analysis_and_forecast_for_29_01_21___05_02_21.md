XAUUSD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 29.01.21 – 05.02.21Alex
Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions from corrections above the
level of 1803.28 with a target of 1960.41 – 2073.73.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
1803.28 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of
1760.88 – 1718.57.

 **Analysis:** Daily time frame: presumably, the ascending third wave of
larger degree (3) formed, and a descending correction developed as wave
(4).  The fifth wave (5) appears to be developing on the H4 time frame,
with wave 1 of (5) formed and a local correction completed as wave 2 of
(5) inside.  The third wave 3 of (5) started developing on the H1 time
frame, with wave (i) of i of 3 formed and wave (ii) of i of 3 completed
as part of it. If the presumption is correct, the pair will continue to
rise to the levels of 1960.41 – 2073.73. The level of 1803.28 is
critical in this scenario as its breakout will enable the pair to
continue declining to the levels of 1760.88 – 1718.57.
