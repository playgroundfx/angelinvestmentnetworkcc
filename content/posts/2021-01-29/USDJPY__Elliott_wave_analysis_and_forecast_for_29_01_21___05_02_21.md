USDJPY: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 29.01.21 – 05.02.21Alex
Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions from corrections above the
level of 103.32 with a target of 105.31 – 106.17.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
103.32 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of 101.74
– 100.00.

 **Analysis:** Daily time frame: presumably, a correction of larger
degree is completed in the form of wave (B). Wave (С) has started to
form, with the third wave 3 of (C) developing as part of it. On the H4
time frame, the third wave of smaller degree iii of 3 finished forming,
and an ascending correction is developing as the fourth wave iv of 3.
Apparently, wave (а) of iv and wave (b) of iv have developed on the H1
time frame, and wave (c) of iv is developing at the moment. If the
presumption is correct, the pair will continue to rise to the levels of
105.31 – 106.17. The level of 103.32 is critical in this scenario, as
the breakout will enable the pair to continue declining to the levels of
101.74 – 100.00.
