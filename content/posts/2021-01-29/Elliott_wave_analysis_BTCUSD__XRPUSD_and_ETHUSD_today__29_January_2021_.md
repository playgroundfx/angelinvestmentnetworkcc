Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 29.01.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

Three major cryptocurrencies have finished the corrective waves, and so
the price should start rising in impulse waves.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

The market has finished the long-term corrective wave 4, which is an
element of the bullish impulse of a larger degree. Wave 4 is a bearish
triple zigzag [W]-[X]-[Y]-[X]-[Z]. Therefore, the price should be rising
in the sub-wave 5 over the next few days. Therefore, one could enter buy
trades. The first target is 34880.00, which is a high made by wave [X].

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 33087.50 TP 34880.00

* * *

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

The chart displays the upward wave structure composed of the sub-waves
1-2-3-4-5, which is the first wave of the global impulse C, unfolding as
a leading diagonal. The corrective wave 4 must have completed as a
bearish triple zigzag [w]-[x]-[y]-[x]-[z]. Therefore, there should be
developing the final sub-waves 5. The first target is level 0.284, which
is the high made by the linking wave [x]. One could enter purchases.

### Trading plan for **[XRPUSD][2]** today:

Buy 0.260, TP 0.284

* * *

## Elliott wave Ethereum analysis

The ETHUSD market is forming the upward impulse wave 1-2-3-4-5. The
corrective wave 4 seems to have completed its pattern. Wave 4 has a
complex structure of a triple zigzag [w]-[x]-[y]-[x]-[z]. Therefore, the
Ethereum price should be rising in the final sub-wave 5 over the next
few days. The first target is level 1468.00, marked by the upward
linking wave [x]. I recommend buying the ETHUSD.

### Trading plan for  **[ETHUSD][3] **today:

Buy 1288.25, TP 1468.00
