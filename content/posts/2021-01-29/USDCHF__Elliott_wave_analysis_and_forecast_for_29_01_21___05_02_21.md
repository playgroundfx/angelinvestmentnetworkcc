USDCHF: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 29.01.21 – 05.02.21Alex
Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 0.8974 with a target of 0.8700 – 0.8600 once the correction is
completed.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
0.8974 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 0.9201 –
0.9297.

 **Analysis:** Presumably, the descending first wave of larger degree
(1) of 5 continues developing on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame, with wave 5 of
(1) forming as part of it. The fifth wave of smaller degree v of 5 is
developing on the H4 time frame. Wave (iii) of v formed, and a local
correction is developing in the form of wave (iv) of v as part of wave v
of 5. Apparently, wave с of (iv) is developing on the H1 time frame. If
this assumption is correct, the pair will continue to fall to 0.8700 –
0.8600 once that wave is complete. The level of 0.8974 is critical in
this scenario. Its breakout will allow the pair to continue rising to
the levels of 0.9201 – 0.9297.
