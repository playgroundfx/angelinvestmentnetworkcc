One doesn't have to be in the same boat with hedge funds to earn money

## Market titans got beaten by beginner traders

Tell the wolves of Wall Street that a backwoods dove pecked their lunch.
Unexpectedly, beginner traders won a fight against market professionals,
setting a precedent. JP Morgan hurried to make a list of 45 issuers that
can follow the example of GameStop, AMC Entertainment Holdings, and
other small, potentially unprofitable companies whose stocks skyrocketed
on 27 January just because "plankton" traders had rushed to the attack.

Some traders believe that the events around the shares of the video game
retailer and the movie theater compromise the authority of fundamental
analysis, whereas I'd add they are doing the same to technical analysis.
VSA repeatedly emphasizes that we need to look for a big player's trace,
that professional traders always know what to do, and amateurs just
follow them. The fans of charts like talking about big fish and plankton
traps. They say the Sun would still be spinning around the Earth if we
listened to what the majority says. Will the business sharks be able to
wash away that shame? The Wall Street wolves lost to nerds.

Never check a pool's depth with both legs at the same time. Amidst
GameStop and AMC Entertainment Holdings' gloomy prospects, hedge funds
borrowed their stocks, expecting to make a profit by buying them at a
lower price later. The reality turned out to be different. The crowd
from Reddit, where the WallStreetBets forum users outnumbered 4 million,
Twitter, Facebook, and other social media wiped the titans off the face
of the earth.

Don't play against the herd! The disgraced money bags will remember that
motto for a long time. Herd psychology is a powerful thing! Mark
Zuckerberg himself says the US Civil War could have been avoided if
Lincoln had been banned on social media.

What happened to GameStop, AMC Entertainment Holdings, and other
companies interested the regulatory bodies. Both the White House and
Jerome Powell heard the [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/). They both don't keep their noses clean. If
not for huge fiscal and monetary stimuli and billions of dollars held by
bored, house-sitting people, such turmoil could have been avoided. How
can the Central Bank watch financial markets and wait for tips from them
now when doomed issuers manage to turn everything upside down and
skyrocket so steeply?

Not having money is a problem; having too much money can be a real
disaster. Perhaps, Congress shouldn't hurry to introduce Biden's new
relief package worth $1.9 trillion: the Americans may not use it to
support the economy. And why should they, when they have Reddit and the
like?
