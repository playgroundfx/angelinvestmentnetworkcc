Medium-term forecast for oil, gold, and EURUSD 29.01.2021Alex Rodionov

I welcome my colleagues! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest trading
signals for traders who trade in medium-term trends.

This week the euro traders worked out the mirror level [1.2165 - 1.2146]

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for next week: USCrude analysis

WTI oil is trading in the accumulation zone [53.90 - 51.40]. In other
words, it is trading flat. Nevertheless, according to the methodology,
the priority of the upward movement is still maintained. The trend key
support is located at the [49.39 - 48.94] level.

Next week wait for the price to exit the flat. If the price breaks out
the upper border of the flat zone at 53.90, it will be possible to
assume that the price will continue to rise with the target at Target
Zone 5 [59.82 - 59.31]. If the price breaks out the flat's lower border,
then enter a trade on the retest, the target will be at Target Zone
[49.39 - 48.94] .

### [USCrude][1] Trading tips for the upcoming week:

  1. If the price exits the accumulation zone [53.90 - 51.40] up - buy on retest. TakeProfit: Target Zone 5 [59.82 - 59.31]. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. If the price exits the accumulation zone [53.90 - 51.40] down - sell on retest. TakeProfit: Target Zone [49.39 - 48.94]. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Gold price forecast for next week: XAUUSD analysis

The gold medium-term uptrend continues, despite the formation of the
accumulation zone [1859 - 1818]. The price has been trading in this zone
for three weeks. The longer this flat continues, the stronger the exit
from it can be expected.

If the price exits the accumulation zone up, the targets for purchases
will be the January's high and Target Zone 2 [2005 - 1994].

If the price exits the accumulation zone down, sell the metal with the
target at the lower Target Zone 2 [1759 - 1749].

### [XAUUSD][2] Trading tips for the upcoming week:

  1. If the price exits the accumulation zone [1859 - 1818] up - buy on retest. TakeProfit: Target Zone 2 [2005 - 1994]. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. If the price exits the accumulation zone [1859 - 1818] down - sell on retest. TakeProfit: Target Zone 2 [1759 - 1749]. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Euro/dollar price forecast for next week: EURUSD analysis

This week the euro traders worked out the mirror level [1.2165 -
1.2146]. As a result, the price tested the support level [1.2062 -
1.2053]. Now it is trading again in the correction to the medium-term
downtrend.

The aim of the correction is to update the last week's high and test the
trend border [1.2229 - 1.2213].

After testing the trend border, it will be profitable to look for the
euro sales according to the pattern to update the January's low and
reach the lower Target Zone 2 [1.1981 - 1.1962].

### [EURUSD][3] Trading tips for the upcoming week:

Sell according to the pattern in Target Zone [1.2229 - 1.2213].
TakeProfit: Target Zone 2 [1.1981 - 1.1962]. StopLoss: according to the
pattern rules.
