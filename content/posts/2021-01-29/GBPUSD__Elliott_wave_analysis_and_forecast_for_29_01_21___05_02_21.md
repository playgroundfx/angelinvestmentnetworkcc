GBPUSD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 29.01.21 – 05.02.21Alex
Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions from corrections above the
level of 1.3624 with a target of 1.3850 – 1.3950.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
1.3624 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of 1.3465
– 1.3310.

 **Analysis:** Daily time frame: presumably, the first wave of larger
degree (1) continues developing, with wave 5 of (1) forming as part of
it. On the H4 time frame, the third wave of smaller degree iii of 5
formed and a correction finished developing in the form of wave iv of 5.
Apparently, wave v of 5 is developing on the H1 time frame, with a local
correction formed as wave (iv) of v and wave (v) of v developing inside.
If the presumption is correct, the pair will continue to rise to the
levels of 1.3850 – 1.3950. The level of 1.3624 is critical in this
scenario as its breakout will enable the pair to continue declining to
the levels of 1.3310 – 1.3194.
