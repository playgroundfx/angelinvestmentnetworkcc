Fed and hall of mirrorsDmitri Demidenko

## Investment ideas based on interaction between Fed and markets

According to economic theory, monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) is the key driver of asset
price changes. Monetary expansion results in a decrease of the bond
market’s rates.  Capital raising costs drop, profitability grows.
Positive corporate reports raise stock quotes. On the contrary, monetary
restriction worsens companies’ financial results because of higher
borrowing costs. In the real world, it often happens that it’s Fed that
follows stock indexes and not the contrary. In 2004, former Fed Chair
Ben Bernanke called the interaction between [S&P 500][1] and the Central
bank “hall of mirrors”.

Should prisoners be allowed to take control over a prison? The stock
market must follow the Fed. Otherwise, the “don’t play against the Fed”
principle would make no sense. Still, the markets work the best when
market participants are under healthy fear of loss. People’s wisdom
remains something to consider while FOMC officials are ordinary people
who make mistakes. It is believed that stock indexes reflect the state
of national economies. If so, the Fed’s officials tend to observe their
signals and compare them with their own views.

If their views are different from the market’s opinion, the Committee
has two ways to go, each of which implies problems. Adjusting monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) to [S&P 500][1]’s signals increases a risk of macroeconomic
instability in future. Playing against the market increases economic
turbulence.

The Fed has tried both ways.  Jerome Powell and his colleagues dropped
the federal funds rate by 150 base points in March 2020 in response to
the fastest ever stock market decline. Also, they declared that
treasuries and mortgage-backed securities would be bought in unlimited
amounts.

In December 2018, the Fed chairman said the current rate was far from
being neutral. It resulted in a large stock market sell-off. The right
communication saved the situation at the beginning of 2019: Powell
corrected himself and emphasized the FOMC’s intention to take a pause.
That allowed [S&P 500][1] to claw back losses.

Ben Bernanke would mention the need to communicate with markets too. It
was his way of solving disagreements between market signals and FOMC
views. Communication is fundamental to the concept of “hall of mirrors”
and allows for drawing a parallel with a psychological pathology, when a
patient feels a vigorous desire to talk to his/her own reflection.

The Fed’s and financial markets’ views often coincided as well. Jerome
Powell gave up the idea of further normalization of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) in
2019, because the yield curve pointed to an upcoming recession. Back
then, it was hard to imagine something that could harm the USA’s solid
economy. The answer is now obvious: coronavirus.

What is the best way of profiting from the hall of mirrors? Finding
mistakes in the Fed’s statements. For example, Powell asserted in early
spring that the States would see a V-shape recovery. Together with a
large monetary stimulus, that assertion allowed [S&P 500][1] to grow 28%
from the levels of March’s trough. Today, this assertion looks
questionable while a change in the Fed’s views could lead to taking
profits on US stocks.
