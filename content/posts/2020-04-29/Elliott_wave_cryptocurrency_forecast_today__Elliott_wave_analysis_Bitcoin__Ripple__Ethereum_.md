###  **Elliott wave[BTCUSD][1] analysis**

 **![LiteForex: Elliott wave cryptocurrency forecast today. Elliott wave
analysis Bitcoin, Ripple, Ethereum.][2]**

The BTCUSD market continues forming the upward corrective wave B that is
a triple zigzag composed of the sub-waves [w]-[x]-[y]-[x]-[z]. There is
unfolding the final zigzag-shaped wave [z] of the triple formation. The
sub-waves (a) and (b) look complete, the (c) impulse hasn’t yet
finished. It may complete at a level around 8100.00. After that, the
market should turn down and start declining in the C-wave, as it is
outlined in the chart.

The XRPUSD market situation is similar to that of the [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/). There is
forming the upward triple zigzag [w]-[x]-[y]-[x]-[z], namely, its final
leg, wave [z]. Based on the structure unfolding, wave [z] is a simple
zigzag (a)-(b)-(c), where waves (a) and (b) are complete, and the (c)
impulse is still developing. There is likely to complete the small down
correction [4] soon, next, the price should start rising in wave [5] to
a level of 0.224, where the entire long-term correction 4 should finish.
An approximate trajectory of the Ripple future price movement is
outlined in the chart.

Within the corrective wave 4 currently unfolding, there is forming the
final motive wave [z] as a simple zigzag (a)-(b)-(c). There is likely to
be developing the final leg of the (c) impulse. This impulse may
complete at a level around 202.00. After that, the price should be
declining in wave 5 to a level of 98.67. This level is the previous low,
created by the bear impulse wave 3.
