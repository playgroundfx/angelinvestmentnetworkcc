Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 04.03.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

On Thursday morning, the oil short-term downtrend continues. Yesterday,
the price corrected up to the trend border [61.64 - 61.42].

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

On Thursday morning, the oil short-term downtrend continues. Yesterday,
the price corrected up to the trend border [61.64 - 61.42]. These levels
haven't been broken out. Today the bulls are trying to break out the
resistance again, but so far to no avail.

Look for oil sales or hold the existing ones. The downside target is to
update the March 3 low, as well as to test the level of 58.73.

Buy oil if the traders manage to consolidate the price above the
Intermediary Zone. In this case, the target will be the upper Target
Zone [64.13 - 63.68].

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

Hold down sales entered in the zone of [61.46 - 60.82]. TakeProfit:
58.73. StopLoss: 62.15.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

Yesterday, the gold short-term downtrend continued, and the March 2 low
has been updated. The traders also consolidated the price below the Gold
Zone [1725 - 1720]. This makes Target Zone 2 [1675 - 1665] the further
target for the price fall.

Now the price is correcting and getting close to the resistance zone
[1732 - 1729]. Enter sales according to the pattern in this level. The
goal is to update the low.

When the Additional Zone is broken out, the market will go up to the
Intermediary Zone [1762 - 1756] following a deep correction.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

  1. Sell according to the pattern in Additional Zone [1732 - 1729]. TakeProfit: 1702. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. If the price breaks out the Additional Zone [1732 - 1729], buy. TakeProfit: Intermediary Zone [1762 - 1756]. StopLoss: below the nearest local low.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

The price didn't break out the border of the euro short-term downtrend
[1.2079 - 1.2071]. Wait for the continuation of the downward price
momentum and the update of the week low. Today consider selling the euro
from the zone of [1.2079 - 1.2091].

The alternative scenario suggests IZ breakout and consolidation higher
at the US trading session. In this case, the trend will reverse up, and
the target for purchases will be the upper Target Zone [1.2167 -
1.2151].

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

Sell according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone [1.2079 - 1.2071].
TakeProfit: 1.1995. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.
