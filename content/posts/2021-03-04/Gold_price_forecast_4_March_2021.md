Gold surrenders. Forecast as of 04.03.2021Dmitri Demidenko

Parallels between the current and previous economic crises are apparent.
The same massive incentives and growth in US Treasury yields. How will
this affect gold? Let us discuss this topic and make up a trading plan.

## Fundamental gold forecast for a year

History repeats itself, alas, negatively affecting gold. There are too
many similarities between the current and previous economic crises to be
safe to say that the [XAUUSD][1] uptrend is broken down. The same
colossal fiscal and monetary stimulus in response to the recession, the
same rapid growth in Treasury bond yields, the same capital outflow from
[ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/)s. It seems that the gold will not hit the $2,000 per ounce mark for
several years, perhaps a decade.

It is no coincidence that February was the worst month for gold since
2016. The precious metal is losing its shine amid growing [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)
confidence in a bright future for the US and global economy and
competition from other financial market assets. The new generation
chooses [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/), while commodities can hedge against inflation risks
just as well as gold.

The growth in Treasury bond yields is hitting not only stocks, so they
look fundamentally overvalued, but also the precious metals market. The
cost of holding assets in [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/)s is on the rise, and non-interest-bearing
gold cannot compete with Treasuries, especially when their rates are
skyrocketing.

### Dynamics of gold and 10-year treasury yields

There is no doubt that events during the previous economic crisis
developed more slowly than they do now. [XAUUSD][1] prices reached a
historic high in 2011, and the transition to the bearish trend took
place only in 2013 due to the taper tantrum provoked by the Fed.
However, one must understand that, first, the nature of the current
recession is unique. Second, the scale of monetary and fiscal stimuli is
not comparable to the previous ones. As a result, many processes go
faster.

and 2020 highs

Does it make sense to keep a non-interest-bearing asset, which also has
many competitors, during a period of the world economy's rapid growth?
According to Bloomberg estimates, consumers in the United States, China,
the UK, Japan, and the Eurozone accumulated a whopping $2.9 trillion
during lockdowns, which will help boost global GDP and global bond
market yields. Thus, it is unlikely that gold will be able to recover
the previously existing trend.

In my opinion, gold lost the war, but it can still win a couple of
battles. I still expect a slight weakening of the USD index this year
because the US production is not keeping pace with rapidly growing
domestic demand. Due to the rapid increase in imports, the US foreign
trade deficit in January reached its second all-time high since 1989.
Therefore, the US economy's growth will have a positive impact on the
global economy and greenback's competitor currencies.

### Gold trading plan for a year

At the same time, the local successes of the [XAUUSD][1] bulls should
not be misleading. The uptrend is broken down, and I wouldn't be
surprised if the gold will reach $1,640 and $1,570 per ounce marks in
2021. The recommendation is to sell the precious metal.
