Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 04.03.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

There are forming bullish double zigzags at the most recent chart
sections of the three cryptocurrency pairs covered in the article. Let
us examine the market situation for each pair in more detail.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

At the time of writing, the BTCUSD market is forming the upward linking
wave [X], which is an element of the descending double zigzag
[W]-[X]-[Y]. The [X] wave is also unfolding as a double combination
(w)-(x)-(y). The sub-waves (w) and (x) have completed, and there is
forming the final impulse wave c, which should conclude wave (y). The
price could reach level 54740.00, where wave [X] will be 76.4% of wave
[W], which is also a double zigzag.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 49595.00, TP 54740.00

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

After the upward corrective wave [B] finished as a triple zigzag, the
market has started declining in the final impulse wave. There have
completed the sub-waves (1)-(2)-(3). There is now forming a long
corrective wave (4), which seems to be unfolding as a double three
w-x-y. There have completed the two first parts of this formation, and
the final sub-wave y is still developing. Wave y could end as a double
zigzag [w]-[x]-[y], like the x wave. The market should be rising in the
impulse (c) of [y] towards the previous high at 0.498, made by wave w.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] today:

Buy 0.439, TP 0.498

* * *

## Elliott wave Ethereum analysis

The ETHUSD is forming a double zigzag, namely its middle part, the
linking wave X. Wave X should be unfolding as a double zigzag
[w]-[x]-[y]. The first two sub-waves [w] and [x] have completed, and
there is developing the final impulse wave (c) of the zigzag-shaped wave
[y]. Most likely, the Ethereum price will move in the (c) impulse to the
level of 1745.00, where wave X will reach 61.8% Fibonacci level of wave
W.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Buy 1552.23, TP 1745.00
