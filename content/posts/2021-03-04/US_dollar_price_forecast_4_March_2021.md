Dollar teases Fed. Forecast as of 04.03.2021Dmitri Demidenko

The bond market and the US dollar continue to test the Fed’s patience.
The rule ‘do not go against the Fed’ is still relevant, but the market
has become stronger. How will the confrontation end? Let us discuss the
Forex outlook and make up a [EURUSD][1] trading plan.

## Weekly US dollar fundamental forecast

The turmoil in the stock market caused by the US Treasury yield growth
is something that we will have to get used to. The problem is that the
current generation of [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s is simply not ready for shocks. They
have never seen a real bear market in the [S&P 500][2]. That is why the
Treasury yield rally shakes the stock indexes.

The US equity market, like the [EURUSD][1], has been down. The US PMI
has reached the highest level since 2016, according to Markit. The ISM
services PMI has been growing for nine consecutive months. According to
the Beige Book, most businesses in the USA remain optimistic regarding
the next six to 12 months. Furthermore, the ADP private-sector
employment has been increasing during the last nine months out of ten.
The above-listed factors have pushed the Treasury yields up, sending
down the US stock indexes and supporting the greenback. Yes, there was a
slowdown in the ISM PMI, but the decline is temporary due to bad
weather. This is proven by the rise in the ISM index of order backlogs
to a six-month high, while the export demand was the strongest since
June.

According to Bloomberg, the primary driver of the Treasury yield rally
is the confidence in the US economic rebound, while the Fed's monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) and the increase in Treasury issuance are less significant
factors.

### Dynamics of drivers of Treasury yield change

Atlanta Fed’s leading indicator signals that the US GDP will expand by
10% in the first quarter, encouraging [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s to sell the US bonds.
The market seems to continue testing the Fed’s persistence. Yes, the
principle 'don't fight against the Fed’ is still valid, but the markets
have become stronger due to massive monetary stimulus. By the end of
2019, the assets of funds around the world were $ 89 trillion, which
exceeds both the balance sheets of the leading central banks ($ 25
trillion) and the size of the global economy.

Therefore, traders need to get used to regular surges in Treasury yields
that overvalue stocks (primarily tech stocks) and lead to pullbacks in
stock indexes. According to FactSet, the [S&P 500][2] P/E is 22, close
to its highest value in 20 years. For comparison, in December 2009, 6
months after the recession, it was 14.

### Weekly [EURUSD][1] trading plan

The FOMC officials seem to be unwilling to clamp down on the US bonds
sales. Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Charles Evans joined
with his colleagues, saying he was unworried about the Treasury yield
rally. If Jerome Powell says the same, and the US jobs report for
February is strong, the bond rates rally will continue. If so, the
[EURUSD][1] could go down below 1.2. I hope the Fed’s Chair will express
concerns about the negative impact of Treasury yield growth on the US
financial conditions, which will allow the euro to go back above $1.2.
