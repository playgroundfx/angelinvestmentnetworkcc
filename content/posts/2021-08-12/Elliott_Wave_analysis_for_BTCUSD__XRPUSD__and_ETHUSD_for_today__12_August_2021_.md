Short-term analysis for BTCUSD, XRPUSD, and ETHUSD for 12.08.2021Roman
Onegin

Dear readers,

Based on the Elliott wave analysis, I've prepared a short-term forecast
for Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. Also, I've provided trading
recommendations and entry points for each cryptocurrency pair.

The three crypto pairs are expected to continue trading up in the near
time.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott Wave analysis for Bitcoin

The Bitcoin price is forming an ascending impulse wave (C), which
started developing upon completion of triple zigzag (B). The impulse
wave (C) includes sub-waves 1-2-3-4, and the ultimate sub-wave 5 is
still unfolding. Level 49991.00 is supposed to be the bulls' target.
It's there that the sub-wave 5 and the whole impulse wave (C) might
fully form. In that scenario, long positions can be considered.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] for today:

Buy 45713.50, TP 49991.00

## Elliott Wave analysis for Ripple

We see the ultimate sub-wave C of an ascending linking wave (X) on the
H1 chart. The wave C is a 5-wave bullish impulse [1]-[2]-[3]-[4]-[5].
The first four parts of that formation have been completed, and the
final fifth part -- sub-wave [5] -- is forming at the moment. The price
is likely to slightly correct in sub-wave (4) in the near time and then
resume surging in wave (5) to the level of 1.1400. In that scenario,
long positions should be considered.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] for today:

Buy 1.014, TP 1.400

## Elliott Wave analysis for Ethereum

##

The market started forming a bullish impulse (1)-(2)-(3)-(4)-(5) upon
completion of a descending corrective wave [B]. The ultimate fifth wave
is developing as an impulse, too. Sub-waves 1-2-3 might have already
formed, so sub-waves 4 and 5 are expected to push above the level of
3280.00, marked by impulse 3. Consider going long in the current
situation.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] for today:

Buy 3178.36, TP 3280.00
