Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 12.08.2021Alex
Rodionov

Hello, my fellow traders! Here's my forecast for such assets as US
Crude, XAUUSD, and EURUSD that I made using margin zones and classical
technical analysis. Based on this analysis, I made a list of entry
signals for intraday traders.

Gold traders exploited the idea of going long from the Intermediary
zone.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil Forecast for today: USCrude analysis

There was a bullish reversal in a short-term downtrend. The price broke
through the Intermediary zone 68.02 - 67.75 yesterday and settled above.
Growth targets are now resistance at 69.76 and Target zone 71.02 -
70.47.

Consider going long from strong support levels, such as Micro-zone 68.60
- 68.53 and Additional zone 67.92 - 67.79.

For us to sell oil, the price must break through the level of 67.14 and
consolidate below. In that case, the trend will turn down again.

### Trading plan for [USCrude][1] for today:

  1. Buy according to the pattern from Micro-Zone 68.60 - 68.53. TakeProfit: 69.76. StopLoss: According to pattern rules
  2. Buy according to the pattern from Additional Zone 67.92 - 67.79. TakeProfit: 69.76. StopLoss: According to pattern rules

## Gold forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

Gold traders exploited the idea of going long from the Intermediary zone
1730 - 1727. Take Profit was triggered in the Gold zone 1755 - 1753.
Next, the short-term uptrend's future will depend on whether or not the
buyers are able to consolidate above 1755. If they are, the next growth
target will be Target zone 2, 1780 - 1775.

If the Gold zone isn't broken today, there may develop a correction with
the first target in the Additional zone 1744 - 1743.

### Trading plan for [XAUUSD][2] for today:

  1. Buy according to the pattern from Additional Zone 1744 - 1743. TakeProfit: Gold zone 1755 - 1753. StopLoss: According to pattern rules
  2. Buy according to the pattern from Intermediary Zone 1733 - 1731. TakeProfit: Gold zone 1755 - 1753. StopLoss: According to pattern rules

## Today’s forecast for the EURUSD: EURUSD analysis

Euro traders reached a powerful resistance level on yesterday's
correction -- Additional zone 1.1754 - 1.1750. The zone wasn't broken,
and the pair is now trading below resistance. So, today's priority
scenario will be going short from those levels. The selling target will
be an update of yesterday's low, after which Target zone 1.1732 - 1.1715
might be broken. That will mean the euro continues dropping in the short
term, the target being located in the Gold zone 1.1644 - 1.1635.

Alternative scenario: breakout of Additional zone and consolidation
above. In that case, the price is highly likely to reach Additional zone
1.1802 - 1.1794.

### Trading plan for [EURUSD][3] for today:

Sell according to the pattern from Additional Zone 1.1754 - 1.1750.
TakeProfit: 1.1708. StopLoss: According to pattern rules
