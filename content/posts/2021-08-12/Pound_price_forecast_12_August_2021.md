Pound remains successful. Forecast as of 12.08.2021Dmitri Demidenko

Sterling remains the Forex favorite due to the rapid economic recovery
and the intentions of the Bank of England to raise the interest rate in
2022. However, one cannot say that the [GBPUSD][1] bulls have no
vulnerabilities. Let us discuss them and make up a trading plan

## Weekly pound fundamental forecast

Unlike most of the major world currencies, which do not want to compete
with the US dollar after the release of impressive US employment data,
the pound has managed to maintain its position. When monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) and
economic growth become the main drivers of Forex exchange rate
formation, sterling has something to respond to its competitors. The BoE
officials are about QE tapering and raising rates more and more, while
GDP figures are more pleasing than upsetting.

In the second quarter, economic growth in the UK was higher than in
other major developed countries. GDP expanded by 4.8%, in line with the
Bloomberg consensus estimate, although slightly below the BoE forecast
of 5%. By the end of June, the size of the UK economy was only 2.2% less
than in February 2020. According to Capital Economics, by October it
will return to its pre-pandemic level.

The expansion of GDP depends on successful vaccination. In the UK, 70.5%
of adults received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine, which is
higher than in the US (58.8%) and the EU (61%), although slightly lower
than in Canada (72.5%) and Spain (71.3%). It should also be noted that
the number of COVID cases in the UK is decreasing, while in the US, on
the contrary, it is growing.

The success of vaccination and the economic recovery allows the BoE
officials to talk about the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) normalization. The
derivatives market is set to increase the interest rate to 0.25% by
August 2022. The indicator is likely to reach its 0.5% threshold by the
end of 2023-the beginning of 2024, after which BoE will stop reinvesting
bond income. According to Bloomberg calculations, by 2030 the central
bank could withdraw about £400 billion from the markets, significantly
reducing BoE's accumulated assets as a result of the implementation of
£895 billion QE.

Thus, from the point of view of economic growth and monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), the
sterling's position looks strong, but it cannot be said that it has no
vulnerabilities. The Irish border issue remains unresolved. London and
Brussels have declared a truce, but there is still a long way to go
before a final solution to the problem. Doves dominate the Bank of
England MPC structure, which suggests that the rate of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
normalization will be slower than that of the Fed.

In the short term, the correction of US stock indices serves as the main
risk for the [GBPUSD][1] bulls, which is likely to affect all financial
markets, including the UK stock market. The pound is very sensitive to
changes in global risk appetite as the UK needs to raise capital to fund
the current account deficit.

### Weekly [GBPUSD][1] trading plan

In my opinion, the [S&P 500][2] consolidation will allow the [GBPUSD][1]
to consolidate in the 1.375-1.4 trading range over the next 2-3 weeks.
It makes sense for traders to use rebound strategies from the
beforementioned range's border zones and focus on narrow targets.
