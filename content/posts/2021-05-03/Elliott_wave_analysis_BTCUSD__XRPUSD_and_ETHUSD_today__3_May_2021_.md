Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 03.05.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

Cryptocurrency pairs continue rising in impulse sub-waves. Let us study
the situation for each cryptocurrency in more detail.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

In early April, the BTCUSD market has finished forming the bullish
impulse (A). There is likely to be forming the initial part of a large
bearish zigzag, the first sub-wave, unfolding as an impulse 1-2-3-4-5.
There has completed wave 1 as a bearish five-wave impulse. Corrective
wave 2 is currently developing as a double zigzag [W]-[X]-[Y]. In the
near future, the price should be rising in the (C) wave, which is a part
of the [Y] wave, to a level of 60470.00, where wave 2 will be 76.4% of
wave 1. Next, bears could drive the price to a level below the low of
47000.00, marked by impulse 1.
