Dollar fooled the bears. Forecast as of 03.05.2021Dmitri Demidenko

Will the euro-area economy catch up with the US amid the increase in the
vaccination rollouts? The answer to this question will determine the
EURUSD trend. Some [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s doubt a soon euro-area economic rebound,
which resulted in the euro drop on the last day of April. Let us discuss
the Forex outlook and make up a [EURUSD][1] trading plan.

## Weekly US dollar fundamental forecast

The US dollar has again surprised the experts. In late 2020, most banks
and investment companies forecast the [EURUSD][1] growth to 1.25 in the
first quarter of 2021. However, slow vaccination in the EU and the
Treasury yields rally sent the euro down to 1.17. Many euro bulls turned
out to become bears. Once it happened, the major currency pair
immediately started rising. As a result, Commerzbank increased the
[EURUSD][1] forecast to 1.23 by the end of the year. Bloomberg
Intelligence sees the euro at $1.25 in late summer, and Citigroup – at
$1.275 by the end of the third quarter. The best dollar [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) rally over
the past two months makes me think that experts could have been fooled
again!

At first sight, the primary reason the [EURUSD][1] crash on April 30 has
become the divergence in the economic growth. Especially since the US
continues reporting positive domestic data. Record growth in household
income (+ 21.1%), the highest increase in consumer spending since summer
2020 (+ 4.2%), acceleration of PCE to 2.3%, and stronger PMI data
confirm that the US economy is steadily expanding.

I believe the reason is fear. Strong US domestic data made the EURUSD
buyers doubt that the idea of narrowing growth gap between the euro area
and the USA amid the vaccination acceleration in the EU will work out.
In the week ended April 27, hedge funds reduced euro shorts to the
lowest level since early March. Moreover, the risk reversals signaled
the highest optimism concerning the major currency pair since late
February. The US-Germany bond yields spread was narrowing, and banks
were improving the forecasts for the [EURUSD][1]. Forex traders were too
optimistic and they went down for it.

The dollar rally was triggered by the statement of Dallas Federal
Reserve Bank President Robert Kaplan that it might be time to discuss
the QE tapering. Nevertheless, the Fed has repeatedly emphasized that it
should be patient, which limits the potential for the Treasury yields
rally in and the EURUSD correction. After all, whether US GDP will grow
to 6.5% in 2021 will depend on US consumer spending. US consumers seem
to be willing to invest in stocks rather than the economy. The share of
stocks in the financial assets of households reached 41%, the highest
ever. __

### Weekly[EURUSD][1] trading plan

I believe [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s were too early to start selling the euro. Yes, the
price drop allowed to work out the trading idea of short-term
[EURUSD][1] sales at 1.209 suggested in the [previous article][2].
However, once the market stabilizes, it will be relevant to look for buy
entries. I suggest the first buy signal should be when the price
rebounds up from the supports at 1.198 and 1.193 or goes up above
1.2045.
