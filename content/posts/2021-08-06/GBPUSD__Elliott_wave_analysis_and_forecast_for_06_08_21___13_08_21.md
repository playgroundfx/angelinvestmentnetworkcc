GBPUSD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 06.08.21 – 13.08.21Alex
Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions from corrections above the
level of 1.3865 with a target of 1.4187 – 1.4253.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
1.3865 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of 1.3779
– 1.3727.

 **Analysis:** Daily chart: the first wave of larger degree (1) finished
developing, with wave 5 of (1) formed inside. A descending correction
appears to have formed as wave (2) on the H4 chart, with wave C of (2)
completed inside. Apparently, the third wave 3 has started forming on
the H1 chart, with the first counter-trend wave of smaller degree i of 1
of (3) formed, a correction completed as wave ii of 1 of (3), and wave
iii of 1 starting to develop inside. If the presumption is correct, the
pair will continue to rise to the levels of 1.4187 – 1.4253. The level
of 1.3865 is critical in this scenario as its breakout will enable the
pair to continue declining to the levels of 1.3779 – 1.3727.
