Central banks blew up bubbles. Review as of 06.08.2021Dmitri Demidenko

Pandemic should not prevent monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) normalization

## The Fed has boxed itself into a corner and heroically tries to get
out

They say Paradise isn't a crowded place as everyone is a sinner. Led by
the Fed, the world's central banks saved the global economy from a
recession pumping it with money. At the same time, they created market
bubbles and have no idea what to do with them now. Those will most
likely blow out if one takes away a cup of punch at the height of the
feast and starts normalizing monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) when global GDP is soaring.
If one doesn't, they will blow out for sure. The only way out is to move
at a snail's pace and not to stop.

However scary and contagious the Delta variant may be, a central bank
shouldn't take off an old mask and turn off the previous road. The
previously stated decisions concerning the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) should not
depend on pandemic waves, as proved by the Reserve Bank of Australia and
the Bank of England in August.

Despite the isolation of Sidney that accounts for 25% of Australian GDP
and 22% of employment, the RBA kept its decision to cut weekly bond
buying from $AU5 billion to $AU4 billion starting from September. Philip
Lowe said economies recovered fast once COVID-19 outbursts had been
neutralized. At the same time, monetary and fiscal stimuli along with
vaccination campaigns gave grounds for optimism. That's simply genius!

London followed Canberra. Although the Bank of England admitted the UK
economic recovery would be uneven and a spike in inflation -- temporary,
it upgraded a forecast for consumer prices to 4% for the end of 2021 and
dropped the rate threshold from 1.5% to 0.5%. As the latter may be
reached as early as 2022, QE might be unwound very soon despite the
pandemic. However, the situation in the UK looks better than in
Australia. No new lockdowns are predicted. Thus, the pound sterling is
constantly attempting to grow while the Aussie is hopelessly falling.

The central banks elaborated a strict plan and continued following the
leader of the pack -- the Fed -- that had started the mess in the bond
market. The US seems to be permanently left holding the baby. Why,
Columbus?

The Fed understands well it's been walking on thin ice. A clumsy step --
and the markets are down. US bond yields will soar, and stock prices
will slump. So, they have to be calm.

To avoid blowing out market bubbles, they have to prescribe a diet to
the markets and withdraw monetary support step by step. However, once
you are on a diet, someone starts gobbling by your side when you least
expect it. If there's a central bank that wants to expand its QE program
or drop rates to counterbalance slow vaccination and stalling economy, a
precedent will be set. Other central banks may want to follow it as
well. Let's wait and see.
