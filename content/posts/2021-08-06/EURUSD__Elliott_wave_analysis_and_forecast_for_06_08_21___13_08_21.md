EURUSD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 06.08.21 – 13.08.21Alex
Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions from corrections above the
level of 1.1750 with a target of 1.2269 – 1.2500.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
1.1750 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of 1.1600
– 1.1489.

 **Analysis:** Daily chart: the first wave of larger degree 1 of (3) is
formed, and a downside correction appears to have formed as wave 2 of
(3). A downward wave c of 2 appears to be completed on the H4 chart,
with the fifth wave of smaller degree (v) of c completed inside. The
third wave 3 of (3) started to unfold on the H1 chart, with the first
counter-trend wave of smaller degree (i) of i of 3 formed inside. If the
presumption is correct, the pair will continue to rise to the levels of
1.2269 – 1.2500 following the correction (ii) of i of 3. The level of
1.1750 is critical in this scenario. Its breakout will allow the pair to
continue falling to the levels of 1.1600 – 1.1489.
