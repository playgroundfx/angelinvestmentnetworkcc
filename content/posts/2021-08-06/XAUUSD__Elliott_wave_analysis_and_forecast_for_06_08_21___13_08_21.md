XAUUSD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 06.08.21 – 13.08.21Alex
Geuta

 **Main scenario:** long positions will be relevant above the level of
1749.29 with a target of 1915.00 – 1958.14 once correction has formed.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
1749.29 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of
1673.40 – 1568.91.

 **Analysis:** an ascending third wave of larger degree (3) formed and a
descending correction developed as wave (4) on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) chart. The
fifth wave (5) appears to be developing on the H4 chart, with the first
wave of smaller degree 1 of (5) formed and a downward correction
completed as wave 2 of (5) inside. The third wave 3 of (5) started
developing on the H1 chart, with a corrective wave ii of 3 forming
inside. If the presumption is correct, the pair will continue to rise to
the levels of 1915.00 – 1958.14 once the correction is over. The level
of 1749.29 is critical in this scenario as a breakout will enable the
pair to continue declining to the levels of 1673.40 – 1568.91.
