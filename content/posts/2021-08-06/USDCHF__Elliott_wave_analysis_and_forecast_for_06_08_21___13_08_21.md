USDCHF: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 06.08.21 – 13.08.21Alex
Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions from corrections above the
level of 0.8925 with a target of 0.9280 – 0.9370.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
0.8925 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of 0.8860
– 0.8763.

 **Analysis:** Daily chart: presumably, a descending first wave of
larger degree (1) of 5 formed and an ascending correction is now
developing as second wave (2) of 5. There's wave C of (2) developing on
the H4 chart, with wave i of C formed and a corrective wave ii of C
presumably completed as part of it. The third wave iii of C appears to
be forming on the H1 chart. If the presumption is correct, the pair will
continue rising to 0.9280 – 0.9370. The level of 0.8925 is critical in
this scenario. Its breakout will allow the pair to continue falling to
the levels of 0.8860 – 0.8763.
