XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

The oil price is being corrected and breaking through the Additional
Zone 68.84 — 68.71.

The article covers the following subjects:

Zone 68.84 — 68.71. The likely correction target is the Intermediary

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

The gold price was testing the Intermediary Zone 1809 – 1807 yesterday.
There was no buy pattern. The price broke out the zone and consolidated
below at the US session. The short-term gold trend turned down.

Sell targets are level 1794 and Target Zone 1786 – 1782. Enter short
trades in the strong resistance zones 1810-1809 and 1822-1820. There
should be a pattern to enter sell trades.

Trade Aggressively, as gold trading flat in the range of 1831-1794 in
the longer timeframe.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

The EURUSD is trading up in the short-term trend. The price entered the
zone of good buy prices 1.1850 - 1.1811 yesterday. It is relevant to
enter buy trades according to the pattern in the zone. The first upside
target is level 1.1905, the second one is in the Target Zone 1.1948 –
1.1930.

A false breakout pattern to buy will emerge when the price breaks out
level 1.1855.

It will be relevant to sell the euro when the price consolidates below
