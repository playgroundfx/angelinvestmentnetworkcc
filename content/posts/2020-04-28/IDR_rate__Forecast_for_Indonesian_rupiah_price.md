IDR rate. Forecast for Indonesian rupiah priceMikhail Hypov

##  **Indonesian rupiah: fundamental analysis, technical analysis,
COVID-19, trend analysis, actual scenario.**

Today we’re analysing the situation in Indonesia and the impact of
coronavirus on this country and its national currency, the Indonesian
rupiah.

###  **Economy** **** **of** **** **Indonesia**

Indonesia is the largest island country: its territory includes 17,804
islands. The most popular tourist island is perhaps Bali and the most
populated one - Java. The country’s population amounts to over 212
million people. Thirty-five million people belong to the agglomeration
of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia, which makes it the world’s second
most populated capital after Tokyo.

The industrial sector has developed greatly in the past decades, but the
agricultural sector is still important to the economy of the country. It
accounts for 14% of GDP and provides jobs to 41% of working population.
As an export-oriented state, Indonesia tops up its budget through
exporting agricultural and mineral resources, which make up 40% of total
exports.

The main exported agricultural products are rice, tapioca, peanuts,
natural rubber, cacao, coffee, copra, poultry meat and eggs.  The king
of agricultural exports is palm oil: Indonesia is the world’s leading
palm oil producer. Coal makes up 10% of Indonesian mineral exports.  The
country is the third biggest coal producer. Also, Indonesia exports oil
and gas for processing and domestic consumption since its developing
industry requires lots of energy resources. The country left OPEC in
2008 and became an oil importer. Also, Indonesia has been increasing the
production and exports of metals and metallic ore: bauxites, tin and
copper. Before the crisis, exports of microelectronics and machinery
construction were growing too, accounting for 9.6% of the country’s
total exports by the end of 2017.

The main importers of Indonesian production are China, Japan, India and
Singapore. The Asian region accounts for 68% of Indonesian exports.
Thirteen percent of production goes to North America, with 11% going
directly to the USA.

###  **COVID-19 in Indonesia**

![LiteForex: IDR rate. Forecast for Indonesian rupiah price][4]

The first coronavirus case was confirmed on 2nd March in Jakarta. As you
can see, the highest number of confirmed cases has been registered in
the agglomeration of Jakarta so far. The government started taking some
measures, which can’t be called radical, only 11 days later.

  * On 13th March, all primary schools in Jakarta were closed. The Indonesian coronavirus task force was set up.
  * On 15th March, Indonesian president Joko Widodo called for social distance. Tax authorities extended filing dates up to 30th April.
  * On 16th March, the Ministry of State Owned Enterprises allowed employees aged 50 or over 50 to work from home.  At the same time, the president didn’t introduce a total lockdown and said that local lockdowns had to be approved by the central government.
  * On 19th March, the Central bank of Indonesia decided to cut the rate to 4.5% in order to help economy.

As you see, these measures are quite soft.

 Joko Widodo declared COVID-19 a “national disaster” only on 13th April.
At least 4557 people had been infected and 399 people had died by that
moment. The fact that 87.2% of the population is highly religious and
mosques hadn’t been closed aggravated the situation.

The Ramadan month was to begin on 23d April and the government faced a
hard choice.

On 21st April, the president banned intercity travel by bus or trains
and sea transportation.  He urged citizens to stay home and cancel
traditional visits during holidays. Perhaps, it was one of the toughest
anti-coronavirus measures.

In the end, the situation got out of control as we can see it in the
chart above. Indonesia’s [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) rise in new COVID-19 cases is currently
the highest in the world. The government is criticized for belated and
too soft measures. Responsibility for decision making lies with local
authorities because assessing the situation is easier for them. A total
lockdown and quarantine haven’t been imposed yet.

High mobility is the peculiarity of the workforce in Indonesia. Many
people work abroad or move for work from provinces to Jakarta.
Migrants’ comebacks may contribute to the spreading of COVID-19 even if
intercity travel has been suspended. The economic aftermath is still to
be estimated: the country is at the early stage of the epidemic.
Considering the virus spread dynamics and population density, the after-
effects may be hard.

###  **Indonesian rupiah**

In contrast to [Iran][6] where the national currency’s rate is
controlled by the government, the Indonesian rupiah is traded at a free
market rate.  What the Central Bank of Indonesia only does is targeting
inflation based on the market methods of developed economies.

The whole [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) of IDR/USD trading is shown in the chart above,
starting with the economic crisis of 1997-1998. The Central bank’s
skilful monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) helps hold the national currency in a range
limited by the peak of 16,850 IDR.

###  **Actual scenario**

### ![LiteForex: IDR rate. Forecast for Indonesian rupiah price][8]

We can see the record fast devaluation of the IDR in the weekly chart
above. It lost 23% in just 2 months, from the end of January to the end
of March. Then it retraced from the historic level of 16,850 IDR marked
in red above. Indicators show that the currency is oversold and this
fact has been already won back by the last correction. There are no
signs of a trend reversal, so we are likely to witness a retest of the
[historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) maximum of 6,850 IDR. Actually, the rate started collapsing
one month before the first coronavirus case was confirmed. It shows that
external markets have a big impact on the export-oriented Indonesian
economy. The chart above shows the most realistic scenario: the
Indonesian government will be fighting the after-effects of the pandemic
the whole year of 2020 and, most likely, 2021.

Amid falling prices of the main exported products - palm oil (see chart
above) and coal (see chart below), the country will face economic
problems not only during the pandemic, but also after it.

To conclude, I can say that the [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) maximum will be most likely
updated in Q3/4 of 2020. The nest maximum may be located near the next
important psychological level of 20,000 IDR, which corresponds to level
2.618 of the first growth wave in 2017-2019.

Time will show the way it will be. I’ll continue sharing my ideas here.
