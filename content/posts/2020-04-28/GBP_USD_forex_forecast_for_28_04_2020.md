Pound set fire to fleetDmitri Demidenko

## When all the major currencies are exposed to the risks, the market is
dwelling on the global risk appetite

The pound’s strength looks surprising. The domestic data are extremely
poor, the Brexit matter hasn’t been settled down, Boris Johnson’s
government is not willing to extend the transitions period, and the
coronavirus fallout can damage the UK economy more than the previous
global financial crisis. The BoE forecasts the UK GDP should drop by 35%
in the second quarter. Nonetheless, despite all the negative factors,
the [GBP/USD][1] rose up from the bottom of the [consolidation range
1.22-1.26][2] and is now driving up to its top.

Bad [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) for the sterling started form the inflation report, the UK
inflation rate was down from 1.7% to 1.5% amid a substantial decline in
the domestic demand due to the pandemic, and it is likely to be moving
down from its 2% target. The far, the worse. The UK composite PMI was
down to a record low (12.6) in March, the retail sales featured the
worst crash ever (-5.1% M-o-M). The GFK’s UK consumer confidence held at
its lowest since 2009 this month after tumbling in late March. As a
result, the UK economic surprise index is falling, however, the
[GBP/USD][1] bulls are going ahead.

Earlier, the pound’s buyers hoped that the UK and the EU will reach a
compromise on Brexit, or the transitions period will be at least
extended. In April, there are hardly any hopes for the better. According
to, Michael Gove, Cabinet Office minister, “whenever a deadline was
extended, the light at the end of the tunnel was replaced by more
tunnel”. The longer is the transition period, the more money will the UK
contribute to the EU’s budget, and it will need to follow the EU rules,
which are likely to be rejected in sovereignty.

Therefore, despite the horrible domestic data and swampy political
environment in the UK, the sterling continues rising. The pound’s
strength seems even more surprising if you look at the speculative
positions on the pound. Over six consecutive weeks, hedge funds were
exiting longs on the GBP, the market turned bearish on the British
currency for the first time since December 2019.

What's the matter? Could the [GBP/USD][1] crash in March be so deep,
that the bad [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) has been priced? I think it makes some sense. However,
this is not the only reason for the pound’s resilience. When the
economic situation is almost equally grim across the globe, markets are
more fixated on swings in sentiment and risk appetite. Many [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s
think that the Brexit is a tiny reason compared to the coronavirus and
recession, so they buy the sterling expecting the economies to reopen
soon in the USA and UK, which should support the S&P 500 and press down
the U.S. dollar.

Nonetheless, weak domestic data and continuous political uncertainty are
the factors that limit the [GBP/USD ][1]rally. Therefore, I still stick
to my [previous forecast ][2]suggesting the pair’s middle-term
consolidation in the range of 1.22-1.26.
