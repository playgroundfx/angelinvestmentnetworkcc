###  **Elliott wave[BTCUSD][1] analysis**

analysis Bitcoin, Ripple, Ethereum.][2]

The upward corrective wave B has been developing as a triple zigzag
[w]-[x]-[y]-[x]-[z] for more than six weeks. There is now forming the
final motive wave [z] as a plain zigzag (a)-(b)-(c). The sub-waves (a)
and (b) have completed, the (c) impulse is yet developing. This impulse
is likely to complete at a level of 8100. After that, the market should
turn down and resume declining in a new downtrend to a level of the
previous low made by the A wave.

The XRPUSD market is forming the fourth segment of the large down
impulse wave (C). The corrective wave 4, currently unfolding, is likely
to complete as a triple zigzag. The price may be moving up in the final
impulse (c) of [z] to a level of 0.206, next, the market should turn
down and start declining in wave 5 to a level around the previous low
made by impulse 3, that is level 0.109.

The ETHUSD market situation is similar to that of the major
cryptocurrencies. The price chart is forming the upward corrective wave
4 as a triple zigzag, with the final wave, impulse 5, developing inside.
Presumably, this impulse should complete at a level of 202.00.
Afterwards, there should start a new downtrend. The price can be moving
down in the new wave to a level of 98.67, which is the previous low,
made by impulse 3.
