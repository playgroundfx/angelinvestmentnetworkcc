Central banks are waking the euro upDmitri Demidenko

## Can the Fed and the ECB make the EUR/USD move?

A bright poster does not promise an interesting show that will make the
audience enthusiastic. It would seem that the important events in the
week through May 1, such as the meetings of the Fed and the ECB, and the
publications of GDP data in the USA and the euro area, should allow
traders expect strong moves in the [EUR/USD][1] pair. However, the
derivatives market doesn’t expect anything special. There has been a
steady fall this month in demand for [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) that pay out should the
euro trade at wider ranges in the short-term than recently seen. The
relative premium to hedge the euro over the next week crashed to almost
a zero level.

Investors do not expect anything new from the Fed’s meeting, but this
doesn’t mean that there will no additional forward guidance revealed. In
March, Jerome Powell suggested a V-shaped recovery of the US economy,
and [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s will be carefully watching for any changes in his tone to
decipher the bank’s next moves. The Fed’s willingness to buy an
unlimited amount of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities resulted in
the growth of the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) pace of Treasuries buying to $75 billion per
day, however, the pace was down to $10 billion per day in late April.
This is also a huge figure that suggests that the Fed’s balance sheet
will be boosted from the current $6 trillion to $8 trillion - $11
trillion. Investors are concerned about further changes in the QE pace.

I must note that the Fed, due to its huge monetary stimulus, has entered
the unknown territory and now faces a number of key risks. What if some
lending programs fail to work? Will the US administration further give
instructions to the central bank? Won’t the Fed’s selective approach to
borrowers undermine the confidence in the regulator? The Fed mostly
provides aid to large companies working closely with capital markets.

The ECB also has problems. Furthermore, the European central bank faces
two problems that the other central banks don't have. One is the risk to
the integrity of the Eurozone. The other is the weakness of the European
banking system. The Eurozone remains far more dependant on bank finance
than the U.S., where the bond market is more important.

Both the Fed and the ECB have two save the economies hit by the
coronavirus outbreak. The Reuters experts forecast that the euro-area
GDP, following six consecutive years of growth, will contract by 3.2% in
the second quarter, the US GDP will lose 4%. Bloomberg gauges the losses
of the global economy at 4% in 2020, which is about $6 trillion. The
euro-area GDP will be 8.4% down, the U.S. growth rate will lose about
6.4%.

In my opinion, the [EUR/USD][1] won’t wake up and exit the trading range
of 1.075-1.09 unless the European QE pace is suddenly increased to €500
billion - €1000 billion. Without this, the [EUR/USD][1] will be
following the US stock indexes and expect the Eurogroup decision on the
fiscal stimulus _._
