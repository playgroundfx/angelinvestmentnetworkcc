Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 08.02.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

All three cryptocurrencн pairs should be declining in the short term.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

 ****

The BTCUSD market is forming a large ending diagonal, with the first two
sub-waves [1] and [2] completed inside. There is unfolding the upward
wave [3] as a zigzag. After the bullish impulse (a) completed, the price
has started declining in the corrective wave (b) that could end at a
level of around 35500.00. Next, the market will resume rising in the (c)
impulse, as it is outlined in the chart. One could enter sell trades in
the current situation.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Sell 38583.00 TP 35500.00

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

 ****

In late January 2021, the XRPUSD market has completed a large upward
linking wave (X) as a standard zigzag composed of the three major sub-
waves A-B-C. Next, there has started forming a new zigzag-shaped
pattern. There is likely to be forming the bearish wave W as a zigzag
[A]-[B]-[C]. Wave [B] has recently completed as a triple zigzag.
Therefore, the price should be declining in the final impulse wave [C],
which should conclude wave W at a level of around 0.300.

### Trading plan for **[XRPUSD][2]** today:

Sell 0.419, TP 0.300

* * *

## Elliott wave Ethereum analysis

 ****

The market must have completed the global zigzag-shaped pattern composed
of the sub-waves A-B-C. After the bullish impulse C finished, the ETHUSD
market turned down and started declining. There is likely to be forming
the initial element of the bearish impulse wave. The first two sub-waves
(i) and (ii) look complete, and the price should be declining in impulse
(iii) to a level below 1260.00, which was marked by the triangle
correction 4.

### Trading plan for  **[ETHUSD][3] **today:

Sell 1610.44, TP 1260.00
