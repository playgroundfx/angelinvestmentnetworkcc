Economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the week 11.05.2020 – 17.05.2020Jana Kane

##  **Overview of the main events of the Forex economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the
next trading week 11.05.2020 to 17.05.2020**

 **Trading on key Forex [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/): we are expecting the publication of
important macro statistics from China, the US, Australia, Great Britain,
Germany, the Eurozone, as well as the results of the meeting of the RB
of New Zealand and its decision on the interest rate.**

Despite the decline on Friday, last week the dollar was still able to
strengthen. The DXY dollar index rose another 0.5% (about 50 points)
over the week, to 99.80 at the end of the trading day last Friday.

According to the Labor Department last Friday, in April, US unemployment
reached a record high of 14.7%, while the Non-Farm Payrolls fell by an
unprecedented 20.5 million, as the coronavirus epidemic damaged the
economy. It was the sharpest monthly drop since 1939. April unemployment
data broke the 1948 record when it reached 10.8%.

According to the US Department of Labor report, nearly 23 million people
received unemployment benefits during the week of April 19-25. The most
affected Americans were those with lower incomes.

Although companies are already resuming operations in some states, in
the longer term, the recovery of the world's largest economy will depend
on factors such as the development of the coronavirus situation and how
quickly consumers begin to return to work and spend money.

The US stock indices also rose last week. Investors are in a hurry to
jump in the departing train. Their optimism is fueled by hopes for a
quick recovery in the US economy after the restrictions on coronavirus
are lifted. Meanwhile, medical experts warn of the possibility of a
second wave of the epidemic if restrictions and quarantine are lifted
prematurely.

Another reason for serious concern for [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s may be the growth of
geopolitical tensions in relations between Washington and Beijing
associated with the actions of China during the outbreak of coronavirus
in this country. The US President Donald Trump said last Wednesday that
he would “closely monitor” China’s fulfillment of its obligations under
the first-phase trade agreement concluded earlier this year, which
implies Beijing’s increase in purchases of US goods and services by $200
billion over the next two years.

Next week, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s will pay attention to the publication of important
macro statistics from China, the US, Australia, Great Britain, Germany,
the Eurozone, as well as the results of the meeting of the RB of New
Zealand and its decision on the interest rate.

 _ **Traders should pay attention to the following significant
macroeconomic data expected next week:**_

 *** during the coming week new events may be added to the [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) and
scheduled events may be canceled**

 ****** **GMT time**

###  **Monday, May 11**

No important macro statistics planned to be released.

###  **Tuesday, May 12**

###  **(publication time not available) AUD Budget Plan**

During the Asian trading session, the Australian government will publish
an annual budget plan, which is likely to cause increased volatility in
the Australian dollar. However, the exact time of publication is
unknown.

###  **01:30 CNY Consumer Price Index (CPI)**

The National Bureau of Statistics of China will present data reflecting
the dynamics of consumer prices in China in April. Rising consumer
prices could trigger inflation acceleration, which could force the
People’s Bank of China to take measures aimed at tightening monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). The increase in consumer inflation may cause the yuan to rise, a
low result will put pressure on the yuan.

China's economy is the second largest in the world after the American.
Therefore, the publication of important macroeconomic indicators of this
country has a significant impact on world financial markets, primarily
on the position of the yuan, other Asian currencies, the dollar,
commodity currencies, as well as Chinese and Asian stock indices. China
is the largest buyer of commodities and a supplier to the global
commodity market of finished products of a wide range.

In January 2020, the growth of the consumer inflation index was at +1.4%
(+5.4% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)), in February +0.8% (+5.2% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)), and
in March the CPI index decreased by -1.2%, although it grew in annual
[terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) by +4.3%.

Deterioration of macroeconomic indicators, including a decline in
consumer inflation, could negatively affect the yuan and commodity
currencies such as Canadian, Australian, and New Zealand dollars. This
is most true for the Australian dollar, since China is Australia's
largest trade and economic partner.

According to the forecast, it is expected that the Consumer Price Index
will continue to decline in April by -0.5% (+3.7% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)). The
growth of the consumer inflation index will positively affect the yuan,
as well as commodity currencies, primarily the Australian dollar.
However, a relative decrease in CPI may negatively impact them.

###  **12:30 USD Core Consumer Price Index (ex food and energy)**

Core Consumer Price Index (Core CPI) determines the change in prices of
a selected basket of goods and services for a given period and is a key
indicator for assessing inflation and changing consumer preferences.
Food and energy are excluded from this indicator for a more accurate
estimate. A high result strengthens the US dollar, while a low result
weakens it. In January, the value of the indicator amounted to +0.2%
(+2.3% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)), in February +0.2% and +2.4% (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)),
in March -0.1% (+2.1% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)). Forecast for April: -0.2% and
+1.7% (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)). If the data for April is weaker than the
forecast, then the dollar will most likely respond with a short-term
strong decline. Data better than forecast will strengthen the dollar.

###  **Wednesday, May 13**

###  **01:30 AUD Wages Index**

The Australian Bureau of Statistics will publish the wages index, an
indicator that measures the inflation of labor costs and the level of
demand for it. Analysis of the dynamics of wages is carried out using
the index method. WAGES INDEX is an indicator of the dynamics, increase
or decrease in the average monthly wages of workers and employees for a
certain period. The Reserve Bank of Australia pays great attention to
this indicator when deciding on the interest rate. In general, high
indicators are considered a positive factor for the AUD, and vice versa,
low index values ​​are a negative factor for the AUD. It is expected
that in the 1st quarter of 2020, the index will indicate wages growth in
Australia of +0.5% (versus +0.5% in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th quarters
of 2019). The Australian dollar is likely to react poorly to the
publication of this indicator if it coincides with the forecast.
Volatility may increase if the data differs from the forecast.

###  **02:00 NZD The decision of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand on the
interest rate. Accompanying statement**

After the bank management made a decision to lower the rate by 0.75%
during an unscheduled meeting on March 15, the current interest rate of
the Republic of New Zealand is at 0.25%. The management of the bank
explained its decision by the loss of momentum in the New Zealand
economy and the sharp slowdown in the global economy amid the
coronavirus pandemic.

"World economic activity continues to weaken, which reduces the demand
for goods and services from New Zealand. Increased uncertainty and a
decline in international trade contribute to a decrease in economic
growth in the trading partner countries," the RBNZ said in a recent
statement.

The RBNZ believes that wage growth remains weak. At the same time,
inflationary expectations are falling, and low levels of business
confidence indicate a slowdown in hiring and wages growth.

Restrained economic growth (New Zealand's GDP growth has slowed since
the second half of 2018) and a weakening labor market, as well as an
escalation of international trade wars and a worsening global economic
outlook, are pushing the Reserve Bank of New Zealand to keep interest
rates low. An additional and unforeseen risk for the world and New
Zealand economies was the epidemic of coronavirus in the world.

It is expected that at this meeting the RBNZ will not lower or raise the
rate, but may speak in favor of lowering it in the coming months in the
event of a worsening economic situation in the country and in the world.

In an accompanying statement, the RBNZ management will explain the
decision on the interest rate and comment on the economic conditions
that contributed to this decision.

At this time, the volatility in trading on the New Zealand dollar could
rise sharply.

Earlier, the RBNZ stated that against the backdrop of “a multitude of
uncertainty factors,” the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) “will remain soft in the
foreseeable future,” but “can be adjusted accordingly.” According to the
bank’s management, for a stable recovery of the New Zealand economy and
inflation growth “a lower New Zealand dollar rate is needed”.

The head of the RBNZ Adrian Orr is likely to once again confirm the
bank’s penchant for pursuing a soft monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), which will preserve
the pressure on the New Zealand currency.

###  **03:00** **NZD Press conference of the RBNZ**

Earlier, the RBNZ stated that against the backdrop of “a multitude of
uncertainty factors,” the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) “will remain soft in the
foreseeable future,” but “can be adjusted accordingly.” For a stable
recovery of the New Zealand economy and rising inflation “a lower New
Zealand dollar rate is needed.”

The head of the RBNZ Adrian Orr is likely to once again confirm the
bank’s penchant for pursuing a soft monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). His speeches often
serve as an unofficial source of information on the future direction of
the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the RBNZ. In any case, an increase in volatility
in New Zealand dollar quotes is expected during the RBNZ press
conference.

###  **06:00 GBP Industrial production**

This is a leading indicator of the manufacturing sector of the UK
economy. And since industrial production, together with consumer
spending, is the basis of the UK's GDP, the publication of this
indicator may cause a surge in volatility in the pound and the London
Stock Exchange. A high value is a positive factor for the GBP, and a low
value is negative. Forecast: industrial production declined in March by
-5.8% (against growth by +0.1% in February). If the data is confirmed or
is worse than the forecast, the pound will weaken in the foreign
exchange market.

###  **08:30 GBP UK's GDP for the 1st quarter (preliminary release)**

GDP is considered an indicator of the general state of the British
economy. A growing trend in GDP is considered positive for the GBP. UK's
GDP was one of the highest in the world until 2016, when the Brexit
referendum was held. After its growth slowed down, and with the onset of
the global coronavirus pandemic, the rate of growth of British GDP
switched to negative territory.

The forecast expects the UK annual GDP to have decreased by -2% in the
1st quarter of 2020 (after zero in the 4th quarter of 2019). This is a
negative factor for the GBP.

The main factors that can force the Bank of England to keep rates low
are weak growth in GDP, the labor market, and low consumer spending. If
GDP data are weaker than expected, then this will put even more downward
pressure on the pound. A strong GDP report will strengthen the pound.

Simultaneously with the quarterly report, a monthly report on GDP (for
March) will be released. In February, the decline in GDP amounted to
-0.1%. Forecast: in March, UK GDP fell by -7%.

###  **Thursday, May 14**

###  **01:00 NZD Budget publication**

The New Zealand Treasury is publishing a preliminary government budget
for next year. The volatility of the national currency usually increases
at the time of publication of such documents regarding the state of the
financial sector of the country's economy.

###  **01:30 AUD Employment rate. Unemployment rate**

Employment rates reflect a monthly change in the number of employed
Australian citizens. The growth of the indicator has a positive effect
on consumer spending, which stimulates economic growth. A high value is
a positive factor for the AUD, and a low value is negative. Forecast: in
April, the number of employed Australian citizens decreased by 575,000
(after rising in March by 5,900 and by 26,700 in February).

Also at the same time, the Australian Bureau of Statistics will publish
a report on the unemployment rate - an indicator that estimates the
share of the unemployed to the total number of able-bodied citizens. The
growth rate indicates a weak labor market, which leads to a weakening of
the national economy. The decline is a positive factor for the AUD.
Forecast: unemployment in Australia in April was at the level of 8.3%
(against 5.2% in March, 5.1% in February). In general, the indicators
can be described as negative. However, in other large economies, the
labor market has deteriorated on a large scale due to coronavirus.

The RBA leaders have repeatedly stated that in addition to the
international trade situation, the Australian economy and central bank
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) plans are influenced by the level of debts and household
expenses, the growth of workers' wages, as well as the state of the
country's labor market.

In March 2020, the Reserve Bank of Australia lowered its key interest
rate by 0.50% to a new record low of 0.25% due to coronavirus, which was
the 5th rate cut in the last year. According to the RBA management, for
the growth of salaries and acceleration of inflation to the target
range, an unemployment rate of 4.5% or lower is required. Unemployment
in the country is not declining, and the return of inflation to the
middle of the target range of 2-3% is not even on a distant horizon.

The AUD is unlikely to respond positively to the publication of data
from the country's labor market. If the values ​​of the indicators turn
out to be worse than the forecast, then the Australian dollar may
decrease significantly in the short term. Data better than forecast will
strengthen AUD in the short term.

###  **06:00 EUR Harmonized Consumer Price Index (HICP) in Germany
(final release)**

This index is published by the EU Statistical Office and is calculated
on the basis of a statistical method agreed between all EU countries. It
is an indicator for assessing inflation and is used by the Governing
Council of the ECB to assess the level of price stability. A positive
result strengthens the EUR, a negative result weakens it.

In March, the HICP index (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) grew by +1.3%. The
preliminary estimate for April was +0.8%. The final mark for April is
also +0.8%. Probably, the euro is unlikely to react very positively to
the publication of this indicator. If the data turn out to be better
than the forecast, then the euro may strengthen in the short term. The
growth rate is a positive factor for the euro. However, this is still
not enough to break the negative trend of the euro. Data suggests low
inflationary pressures in Germany.

###  **12:30 USD Initial jobless claims in the US over the past week**

The situation on the country's labor market continues to deteriorate
rapidly. Back in February, the indicator of primary claims for
unemployment benefits was within its average values ​​of 193-252
thousand. However, then the situation began to deteriorate sharply. Over
the week of March 22-28, 6.9 million claims were submitted, then 6.606
million, shocking the observers and market participants. A similar
indicator published last Thursday (for the week of April 26-May 01) came
out with a value of 3.169 million claims.

The US Department of Labor data published earlier this month showed an
increase in unemployment in the country in May to the level of 14.7%.

Economists attribute this to the coronavirus, which has hit the US
economy. Many US companies announced layoffs, and authorities ordered
non-vital companies to close their offices and stores in the wake of the
coronavirus epidemic. Eventually, the weekly growth rate of applications
far exceeded the previous record level of 695,000, reached in October
1982. Then the number of initial claims filed in four weeks was 2.7
million.

This indicator reflects the state of the labor market. An increase in
value negatively affects consumption and economic growth. Under normal
conditions, a high result weakens the US dollar, while a low one
strengthens it. However, in the current environment (the coronavirus
pandemic and a sharp economic slowdown), the reaction of market
participants to the publication of this report by the US Department of
Labor can be completely unpredictable.

Forecast: the number of new jobless claims (in the week of May 3-8)
amounted to 2.5 million.

###  **Friday, May 15**

###  **06:00 EUR Germany's GDP for the 1st quarter (preliminary
release)**

GDP is considered the most important indicator of the general state of
the economy. The growing trend of GDP is considered positive for the
national currency. The German economy is the engine of the entire
European economy. A high value of GDP is considered a positive factor
for the EUR, and a low value is negative.

The growth of the European and German economies slowed sharply in 2019,
and in 2020 the European economy has already entered a recession in many
respects. The domestic risks are complemented by the risk of no-deal
Brexit and the coronavirus pandemic.

If GDP data are weaker than expected, this will put even more bearish
pressure on the euro. Data better than forecast can strengthen the euro
in the short term. However, the risks for the euro are directed towards
its further weakening. Forecast: German GDP fell in the 1st quarter by
-2.1%.

###  **09:00 EUR Eurozone GDP for the 1st quarter (second estimate)**

GDP is considered an indicator of the general state of the Eurozone
economy. The growing trend of GDP is considered positive for the EUR;
low result weakens the EUR.

Recently, macro data from the Eurozone have been indicating a slowdown
in the growth of the European economy. Amid persistently low inflation,
the risks of a slowdown in economic growth may force the ECB to resume
easing monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).

Against the background of downward pressure from the economic and
political situation in the Eurozone, the balance of risks for the euro
is shifted downward, and its recovery in the short term is not expected.
The coronavirus that reached Europe has also become an unforeseen and
strong factor that already has an additional negative impact on the
world and European economies.

According to the forecast of economists, the Eurozone's GDP is expected
to fall in the 1st quarter by -3.8% (-3.3% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) after
growing by +0.1% (+1.0% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) in the previous 4- m quarter of
2019.

If the data turn out to be weaker than the forecast, then the euro may
drop significantly. Data better than forecast will strengthen the euro
in the short term.

###  **12:30 USD Retail sales (ex Autos). Retail Control Group**

This report (Core Retail Sales Ex Autos) reflects the total sales of
retailers of all sizes and types, with the exception of car dealerships.
Changes in retail sales are a major indicator of consumer spending. The
report is leading, and in the future the data can be strongly revised. A
high result strengthens the US dollar, a low one weakens it. A relative
decrease in the indicator may have a short-term negative impact on the
dollar, and an increase in the indicator will positively affect the USD.
Forecast for April:

-8.6% (versus -4.5% in March, -0.4% in February).

Retail sales are a major consumer spending indicator in the United
States showing changes in retail sales. The Retail Control Group measure
measures the volume of the entire retail industry and is used to
calculate price indices for most products. A strong result strengthens
the US dollar, and vice versa, a weak report weakens the dollar. A
slight increase in performance is unlikely to accelerate the growth of
the dollar. Data worse than the previous period (+1.7% in March, 0.0% in
January and February) will negatively affect the dollar in the short
term. Forecast for April: -3.9%.

###  **12:30 CAD Retail Sales Index**

The Retail Sales Index is published monthly by Statistics Canada and
estimates total retail sales. The index is often considered an indicator
of consumer confidence and reflects the state of the retail sector in
the near future. Index growth is usually a positive factor for the CAD;
a decrease in the indicator will negatively affect the CAD. Previous
index values: 0.3% in February and 0.6% in January. If the data for
March is weaker than the previous values, the CAD may drop sharply in
the short term.

###  **14:00 USD University of Michigan Consumer Confidence (preliminary
release)**

This indicator reflects the confidence of American consumers in the
economic development of the country. A high level indicates economic
growth, while a low indicates stagnation. Previous indicator values:
99.8 in January, 101.1 in February, 89.1 in March, 71.8 in April. An
increase in the indicator will strengthen the USD, and a decrease in the
value will weaken the dollar. This indicator is expected to be released
in May with a value of 68.0. There is a clear downward trend, which is a
negative factor for the USD. Data worse than forecast may even more
negatively affect the dollar in the short term.
