Economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the week 27.04.2020 – 03.05.2020Jana Kane

##  **Overview of the main events of the Forex economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the
next trading week 27.04.2020 to 03.05.2020**

 **Trading on key Forex [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/): we are expecting the publication of
important macro statistics from Australia, Germany, the US, Japan, the
Eurozone, as well as the results of the meetings of the central banks of
Japan, the US, and the Eurozone, where they will decide on the interest
rates.**

Investor anxiety over the spread of the coronavirus pandemic and an
almost landslide slowdown in the global economy does not allow global
stock indices to develop the upward movement that began at the end of
last month.

According to the results of last week, the main US and world stock
indices fell, but the DXY dollar index grew by another 0.5%.

Johns Hopkins University, which makes calculations based on the
information provided by the US authorities, the World Health
Organization and other official sources, indicates that the number of
cases of coronavirus infection in the world on April 24 exceeded 2.7
million.

At the same time, medical experts are warning about the possibility of a
second wave of the pandemic if some countries begin to lift restrictions
and quarantine too soon.

Last week we also saw a record drop in world oil prices amid excess
supply and a shortage of storage facilities. May's WTI oil futures found
themselves in negative territory for the first time, putting oil market
participants in an almost hopeless situation. This means that sellers
had to pay buyers to take the oil. By the end of the week, prices for
the most actively traded WTI oil futures fell by about 32%.

Next week, the first estimates of GDP for the 1st quarter will be
published. They are expected to indicate a deeper recession in the
economy. However, the decline projected for the 2nd quarter may turn out
to be much more serious. Many economists expect GDP to fall by 40% in
the 2nd quarter in the US, 45% in the Eurozone, 59% in the UK, and 35%
in Japan.

These data indicate that the global economy is entering a recession.

Next week, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s will pay attention to the meetings of the central
banks of the US and the Eurozone and their decisions on interest rates,
as well as the publication of important macro statistics from Australia,
Germany, the US, Japan, and the Eurozone.

 _ **Traders should pay attention to the following significant
macroeconomic data expected next week:**_

 *** during the coming week new events may be added to the [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) and
scheduled events may be canceled**

 ****** **GMT time**

###  **Monday, April 27**

No important macro statistics planned to be released.

###  **Tuesday, April 28**

###  **03:00 JPY Bank of Japan's interest rate decision. Bank of Japan's
press conference and monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) comments**

The Bank of Japan will decide on the interest rate. Currently, the main
discount rate in Japan is in negative territory, amounting to -0.1%.
Most likely, the rate will remain the same. If the rate is cut and
deepens into negative territory, such a decision will cause a sharp
decrease in the yen in the foreign exchange market and growth in the
Japanese stock market. In any case, during this period of time, a jump
in volatility is expected in trading on the yen and on the Asian
financial market.

During the press conference, head of the Bank of Japan Haruhiko Kuroda
will comment on the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the bank. The Bank of Japan
continues to adhere to its super-soft monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). As Kuroda has
repeatedly stated before, "it is appropriate for Japan to patiently
continue the current soft monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)." Markets usually react
actively to Kuroda's speeches. He is likely to touch upon the topic of
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) in his speech, which will cause an increase in
volatility not only in yen trading, but throughout the Asian and world
financial markets.

If the bank's leaders decide that the Japanese economy is stable, and
inflation is steadily moving to the target level of 2%, they will
refrain from changing policies.

###  **06:00 JPY Press conference of the Bank of Japan**

During the press conference, the head of the Bank of Japan Haruhiko
Kuroda will comment on the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the bank. Despite earlier
measures taken by the bank to stimulate the Japanese economy, inflation
remains low, production and consumption are falling, which negatively
affects export-oriented Japanese producers. Markets usually react
actively to Kuroda's speeches. If he touches on the topic of monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) during his speech, volatility will increase not only in yen
trading, but throughout the Asian and world financial markets.

###  **08:00 EUR Eurozone Bank Lending Survey**

A study of the bank lending system by the EU financial experts of the
state is carried out 4 times a year. The main objective of the study is
to obtain extended information about the conditions of bank lending in
the Eurozone.

The data are used by the ECB management in making decisions on the
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the bank. This report may cause an increase in
volatility in the quotations of the euro and on the European stock
market if it contains unexpected conclusions regarding lending
conditions for businesses and households in the Eurozone.

###  **22:45 NZD Unemployment rate (data for the 1st quarter)**

The Bureau of Statistics of New Zealand will publish a report on
unemployment - an indicator that estimates the share of the unemployed
to the total number of able-bodied citizens. The growth indicates a weak
labor market, which leads to a weakening of the national economy. The
decline is a positive factor for the NZD. Forecast: unemployment in New
Zealand in the 1st quarter increased to 4.2% from 4.0% in the 4th
quarter. If the forecast is confirmed, or if the data turn out to be
worse than the forecast, the NZD is likely to decline.

Better data than expected will have a positive effect on the NZD.

###  **Wendesday, April 29**

###  **01:30 AUD RBA's Trimmed Mean Inflation (for the 1st quarter).
Consumer Price Index (Q1)**

This indicator is published by the RBA and the Australian Bureau of
Statistics. It reflects the dynamics of retail prices of goods and
services that are part of the consumer basket. The trimmed mean method
takes into account the weighted average core, the central 70% of the
components of the index. Previous index values: +0.4% (+1.6% in annual
[terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) in the 4th, 3rd and 2nd quarters of 2019. According to the
forecast, the indicator is expected to be at +0.4% for the 1st quarter
of 2020 (+1.5% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)). If the value of the indicator coincides
with the forecast or is worse than it, this is likely to negatively
affect the AUD. The data indicate low inflationary pressures in the
country. The growth rate should positively affect the AUD in the short
term.

Inflationary Consumer Price Index (CPI) published by the RBA and the
Australian Bureau of Statistics estimates the dynamics of retail prices
of goods and services in Australia. CPI is the most significant
indicator of inflation and changes in customer preferences. A high value
is a positive factor for the AUD, and a low value is negative. Previous
indicator values: +0.7% (+1.8% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) in the 4th quarter,
+0.5% (+1.7% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) in the 3rd quarter of 2019. According to
the forecast, the value of the indicator for the 1st quarter of 2020
will be +0.6% (+1.7% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)). A decrease in the indicator is
likely to negatively affect AUD in the short term. If the value of the
indicator turns out to be worse than the forecast, this will have an
even more negative impact on the AUD.

###  **12:00 EUR Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices  (HICP) in Germany
(final release)**

This index is published by the EU Statistical Office and calculated on
the basis of a statistical method agreed upon between all EU countries.
It is an indicator for assessing inflation used by the Governing Council
of the ECB to assess the level of price stability. A positive result
strengthens the EUR, a negative result weakens it.

In January, the HICP index (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) grew by +1.6%, and in
February by +1.7%. The preliminary forecast for March was: +1.3%. The
euro is unlikely to react positively to the publication of this
indicator. If the data turn out to be better than the forecast, then the
euro may strengthen in the short term. The growth rate is a positive
factor for the euro. However, this is still not enough to break the
negative trend of the euro. The data suggests low inflationary pressures
in Germany. The data worse than the forecast (+1.4%) and the previous
value (+1.3%) will negatively affect the euro.

###  **12:30 USD US Annual GDP for the 1st quarter (preliminary
release)**

GDP data is one of the key indicators (along with labor market data and
inflation) for the Fed in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of its monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). A strong result
strengthens the US dollar; weak GDP report negatively affects the US
dollar. In the previous 4th quarter, GDP growth amounted to +2.1%.
Forecast for the 1st quarter of 2020: -4.1%, according to preliminary
estimates. The data already takes into account the impact of coronavirus
on the US economy. However, experts predict an even stronger slowdown in
the 2nd quarter. It is likely that the publication of the data will
cause a short-term decline in the dollar. Data weaker than the forecast
may even more negatively affect dollar quotes.

###  **18:00 USD The Fed's decision on interest rate**

Following two meetings in March, the Fed sharply cut its interest rate
(to 0.25% from 1.75% in February), and also announced the allocation of
$700 billion for the purchase of US government bonds and mortgage-backed
securities. Subsequently, the Fed has repeatedly announced additional
measures to support the US economy and inject cheap liquidity into the
financial system. Usually, with the easing of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), the
national currency becomes cheaper and its quotes decline. However, the
US dollar is not declining, continuing to be in demand as a safe haven
asset.

It is widely expected that at this meeting the rate will remain at
0.25%. However, during the publication of the decision on the rate,
volatility can sharply increase throughout the financial market,
primarily in the US stock market and in dollar quotes, if the decision
on the rate differs from the forecast.

###  **18:30 USD Press Conference of the FOMC (US Federal Open Market
Committee)**

The press conference of the US Federal Open Market Committee lasts about
an hour. In the first part, the decree is read, followed by a series of
questions and answers that can increase market volatility.

Powell's comments can affect both short-term and long-term USD trading.
A more hawkish position on the Fed’s monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) is seen as positive
and strengthens the US dollar, while a more cautious position is seen as
negative for the USD. Any hints by Powell regarding the possibility of
changing the current monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) will cause an increase in
volatility in the dollar and the US stock market.

###  **23:50** **JPY Industrial production**

This indicator published by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry
reflects the volume of production of factories, plants and mining
enterprises in Japan. It attracts increased attention, since it is the
main indicator of the state of the country's manufacturing sector. A
high value is considered a positive (or bullish) factor for JPY, and a
low value is considered negative. In February, industrial production in
Japan decreased by -5.7% (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)). The next drop in this
indicator in March is expected to have a negative impact on the yen.

###  **Thursday, April 30**

###  **07:55 EUR Unemployment rate in Germany. Change in the number of
unemployed**

The Statistical Service of Germany will publish data on the country's
labor market for April. Since May 2019, the unemployment rate in the
country has remained unchanged at 5%. If unemployment rises, the euro
will decline. If the data turn out to be better than the previous value,
the euro will strengthen. A decrease in the unemployment rate is a
positive factor for the national economy and the country's currency, and
unemployment growth is a negative factor. Forecast for April: 5.2%.

 **Change in the number of unemployed.** This indicator estimates the
change in the number of unemployed in Germany. The growth of the
indicator is a negative factor for the euro, and vice versa, a decrease
in the indicator will have a positive effect on the euro. In February,
the number of unemployed in Germany fell by 10,000, and in March rose by
1,000. Forecast for April: +70,000 unemployed.

###  **09:00 EUR Consumer Price Index. Core Consumer Price Index
(preliminary release)**

 **Consumer Price Index (CPI)** is published by Eurostat and determines
the change in prices of a selected basket of goods and services for a
given period. The index is a key indicator for measuring inflation and
changing consumer preferences. A positive result strengthens the EUR, a
negative result weakens it. In January, CPI increased by 1.4% (in annual
[terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)), in February - by +1.2%, in March - by +0.7%, which indicates a
low inflationary pressure and even a slowdown in inflation. Forecast for
April: +0% (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)). The expected data are below the previous
value, which is already negative for the euro. If they turn out to be
worse than the forecast, then the euro may decline shortly but sharply.
The data better than the forecast and / or the previous value can
strengthen the euro in the short term, despite the low value (the target
level of consumer inflation of the ECB is slightly below 2.0%).

 **Core Consumer Price Index (Core CPI)** determines the change in
prices of a selected basket of goods and services for a given period and
is a key indicator for assessing inflation and changing consumer
preferences. Food and energy are excluded from this indicator for a more
accurate estimate. A high result strengthens the EUR and a low result
weakens it. In January, Core CPI increased by 1.1% (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)), in
February - by +1.2%, in March - by +1.0%. If the data for April turn out
to be worse than the previous value or forecast, this may negatively
affect the euro. If the data turn out to be better than the forecast or
the previous value, the euro will most likely react with the growth of
quotations, but only in the short term. Eurozone inflation remains low,
which is a negative factor for the euro. Forecast for April: +0.7%.

###  **09:00 EUR Eurozone's GDP for the 1st quarter (preliminary
release). Unemployment rate**

GDP is considered an indicator of the general state of the Eurozone
economy. The growing trend of GDP is considered positive for the EUR;
low result weakens the EUR.

Recently, macro data from the Eurozone have been indicating a slowdown
in the growth of the European economy. Amid persistently low inflation,
the risks of a slowdown in economic growth may force the ECB to resume
easing monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).

Against the background of downward pressure from the economic and
political situation in the Eurozone, the balance of risks for the euro
is shifted downward, and its recovery in the short term is not expected.
Coronavirus, which reached Europe, has also become an unforeseen and
strong factor that already has an additional negative impact on the
world and European economies.

According to the forecast of economists, the Eurozone GDP is expected to
decrease by -3.3% in the 1st quarter (-2.8% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) after
growth by +0.1% (+1.0% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) in the previous 4th quarter of
2019.

If the data turn out to be weaker than the forecast, the euro may drop
significantly. Data better than forecast will strengthen the euro in the
short term.

Also at the same time, Eurostat will publish data on the unemployment
rate in the Eurozone in March. Since November 2018, the unemployment
rate in the region has remained below the level of 8%, falling to the
level of 7%. If unemployment rises, the euro will decline. If the data
turn out to be better than the previous value, the euro will strengthen.
A decrease in unemployment is a positive factor for the economy and the
currency, and growing unemployment is a negative factor. Forecast for
March: 7.7% (against 7.3% in February).

###  **11:45** **EUR ECB's decision on the interest rates**

The ECB will publish its decision on the key rate and deposit rate. The
ECB's tough stance on inflation and the level of key interest rates
contributes to the strengthening of the euro; a soft stance and lower
interest rates weaken the euro. In September 2019, the European Central
Bank lowered its key interest rate on deposits by 0.1% to -0.5% and
began buying bonds by 20 billion euros per month, renewing the
quantitative easing program.

At the subsequent press conference, former president of the European
Central Bank Mario Draghi said that the balance of risks for the
economic prospects of the Eurozone "is still shifted in the negative
direction", implying the possibility of additional stimulation if
necessary.

The ECB rate cut in September was the first one since March 2016, and
“until inflation is in line” with the target level, which is just below
2%, the rate will remain low. Now inflation in the Eurozone is stuck
around 1%, and the ECB's new forecasts on rates and the QE program can
be seen as a signal of a tendency to further soften the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).

It is likely that following the meeting of the ECB, the key interest
rate will remain at the same level of 0%. The ECB deposit rate for
commercial banks is also likely to remain at -0.5%.

After Brexit, the escalation of trade conflicts and factors of political
instability in the Eurozone are the main threats to the European
economy.

Speaking earlier in the European Parliament, Christine Lagarde, who in
November became the new president of the European Central Bank, said the
stimulus measures of the ECB monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) continue to have a
beneficial effect on the economy of the Eurozone. “I agree with the ECB
Governing Council that a stimulating monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) will remain
appropriate for a long period of time,” Lagarde said.

An additional factor that could put pressure on the ECB towards further
easing of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) is the coronavirus. The number of cases in the
world exceeded 2.7 million.

In March, the ECB signaled the possibility of easing its [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), and a
representative of the European Central Bank admitted that the bank's
management may lower the already negative interest rates even lower.

###  **12:30 EUR Press Conference of the ECB**

During the press conference, a surge in volatility is possible not only
in the euro quotes, but also in the entire financial market, if the ECB
leaders make unexpected statements. Similar previous interest rate
decisions of the ECB and subsequent press conferences shifted the euro
by 3-5% in a short time. The ECB executives will assess the current
economic situation in the Eurozone and comment on the ECB's decision on
rates.

The soft tone of the statements will have a negative effect on the euro.
And, on the contrary, harsh tone of the speech of the ECB leaders
regarding the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the central bank will strengthen the
euro.

###  **23:50 JPY Tokyo Consumer Price Index (CPI) (ex fresh food)**

This consumer price index published by the Bureau of Statistics of Japan
reflects an estimate of price dynamics obtained by comparing the retail
prices of the corresponding basket of goods and services. Tokyo's CPI,
ex fresh food, which is an important barometer of changes in consumer
trends, came out in March with a value of +0.4% (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)).
Forecast for April: +0.1%. Japan's inflation is still low. A decrease in
the indicator is likely to negatively affect the yen.

During the publication of CPI indices, an increase in volatility is
expected in the yen and the Japanese stock market, especially if the
actual values ​​will significantly differ from the forecast.

###  **Friday, May 1**

European countries celebrate Labor Day. Banks will be closed, and
therefore the trading volumes in the European session will be low,
which, however, does not exclude the possibility of a sharp short-term
increase in volatility in the financial markets, especially when
unexpected [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) is released.

###  **14:00 USD Employment Index (from ISM) in the manufacturing sector
of the US economy. PMI (from ISM) in the manufacturing sector of the US
economy**

The Employment Index, an important indicator of economic conditions in
the United States, is published by the Institute for Supply Management
(ISM) and reflects business conditions in the US manufacturing sector,
taking into account expectations of future production volumes, new
orders, stocks, employment, and supplies. The ISM manufacturing sector
employment index is considered an important leading indicator when the
US Department of Labor compiles an employment report. A high value
strengthens the USD, while a low value weakens it. In March, the value
of the indicator was 43.8. Index growth is a positive factor for USD.
However, under the current conditions of the coronavirus pandemic and
quarantine, a decrease is to be expected, which will negatively affect
the dollar.

PMI in the manufacturing sector of the US economy, published by the
Institute for Supply Management (ISM), is an important indicator of the
state of the US economy as a whole. A result above 50 is seen as
positive and strengthens the USD, below 50 - as negative for the US
dollar. Forecast: 36.7 in April (against 49.1 in March, 50.1 in
February, 50.9 in January). A relative decline in the index below 50 may
negatively affect the dollar. The result below 50 indicates a slowdown
in activity, which negatively affects the quotes of the national
currency.

In the opposite case, and with the growth of the indicator above the
forecast and the value of 50, the dollar will receive support and
probably strengthen.
