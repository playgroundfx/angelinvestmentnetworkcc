## Elliott wave forecast for BTCUSD, ETHUSD, XRPUSD for today

###  **Elliott wave[BTCUSD][1] analysis**

 **![LiteForex: Elliott wave cryptocurrency forecast today. Elliott wave
analysis Bitcoin, Ripple, Ethereum.][2]**

The BTCUSD market is developing a global plain zigzag that is composed
of three sub-waves A-B-C. After the bear impulse wave A completed, the
market has started rising in the correction B. Based on the structure
unfolding, the B correction is a triple zigzag [w]-[x]-[y]-[x]-[z].There
is likely to be developing the bearish correction (b). It may finish at
a level of 6790, next, the price will be moving up in the final impulse
(c) to a level of 7448. This level is the previous high made by wave
[y].

The chart displays the deep correction 4 that is a part of the bear
impulse wave (C). This correction should be developing as a triple
zigzag [w]-[x]-[y]-[x]-[z]. There is now developing the final bullish
zigzag [z] that is composed of the sub-waves (a)-(b)-(c). The impulse
wave (a) may have completed, so the price should be declining in the
correction (b) to a level of 0.181. Next, the price should resume rising
in the impulse (c) to a level around the previous high made by the
zigzag [y], level 0.204. An approximate trajectory of the Ripple future
price movement is outlined in the chart.

###  **Elliott wave[ETHUSD][5] analysis**

There is also developing a long upward corrective wave 4 that is
developing as a triple zigzag [w]-[x]-[y]-[x]-[z]. The sub-waves [w],
[x], [y] and [x], are likely to have completed, and the final zigzag [z]
is now unfolding. In the near future, the short correction (b) should
complete, after that, the market will continue moving up in the (c)
impulse to a level of 201.29. Presumably, after the correction 4
completes, the ETHUSD market should be declining to a level of the
previous low made by the impulse wave 3, a level around 98.67.
