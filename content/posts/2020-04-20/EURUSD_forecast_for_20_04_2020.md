## Donald Trump remembers the benefits of a strong currency

In April, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s see a new reality, the stock indexes are rising
despite the US horrible macrostatistics and corporate reporting. For the
first time since early February, the S&P 500 has been growing for two
consecutive trading weeks, the Dow Jones Industrial Average performed
the best 2-week rally since 1938, and the Nasdaq reduced losses from the
beginning of the year to 3.6%. The desire to buy something at a cheap
price, increase the proportion of the technology companies’ shares in
the portfolios and the trust in the Federal Reserve are stronger than
the recession and the difficult epidemiological situation.

Do not go against the Fed. This rule seems to have been forgotten in
March when the central bank cut the interest rates abruptly and
announced its willingness to buy an unlimited amount of Treasuries and
mortgage-backed securities. Markets have remembered this rule in April.
Black Rock, which manages $6.5 trillion, is going to buy those foreign
assets that will be acquired by the central banks of the countries of
origin of these assets. According to most [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s, it makes no sense
to struggle with the Fed, and, due to a huge monetary stimulus,
corporate profits will rebound in 2021.

If the US stocks were rising earlier due to the combination of
stimulating measures and hopes that the coronavirus outbreak will be
brought under control, then the bull stock markets in the week through
April 17 resulted from the growing confidence in a soon reopening of the
US economy. Many believe in a V-shaped recovery of the US GDP and are
trying to be proactive in buying stocks.

However, Federal Reserve Bank of New York President John Williams said
Friday that even a swift resolution to the coronavirus pandemic is
unlikely to bring a fast recovery to the U.S. economy. “It is going to
take longer to get us back to where we want to be”, he said.
Furthermore, some support programs, including the $350-billion small-
businesses aid program, have almost been exhausted, and the Congress may
oppose boosting the package of stimulating measures.

I should note that, despite the growth of the S&P 500, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s, unlike
earlier, are not willing to sell the greenback. It isn’t now determined
by stock indexes, as the other major currencies are weak. For example,
the [EUR/USD][2] bulls were frightened by the French president, Emmanuel
Macron, who says that the European Union may splinter if it fails to
share the crisis costs; the coronavirus indicated the euro’s flaws. Some
analysts say the €1.5-trillion monetary and fiscal stimulusmay not be
enough. The ECB may increase QE volume.

The greenback was supported by Donald Trump’s speech. Earlier, the US
president used to enumerate the disadvantages of a too-strong dollar and
suggested it should be weakened. Now, he remembers the benefits of the
strong local currency. According to the US president, strong US currency
encourages foreign [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s to invest in US assets. And the USA, having
low, close to zero, borrowing costs, should get use out of it. “The
dollar is very strong,” he said at a press conference on Friday. “And
the dollars – solid dollars are generally very good.” An abrupt change
in Trump’s tone increases the chance that the[ EUR/USD][2] bears can
break out the support at 1.081.
