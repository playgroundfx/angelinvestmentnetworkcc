The BTCUSD [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) timeframe displays the structure of the corrective wave
4 that is composed of three sub-waves [W]-[X]-[Y]. The first two sub-
waves, [W] and [X], have completed as simple zigzags. The market is now
following the sub-wave [Y] that is likely to complete as a double
zigzag. Let us see the structure if this wave in more detail in the
8-hour timeframe.

It is clear that wave [Y] contains the sub-waves (W)-(X)-(Y). Wave (W)
is a bear triple zigzag, the linking wave (X) is an upward double
zigzag. Wave (Y) is yet developing and may complete as a plain zigzag
A-B-C. After the bear impulse A finished, the market has started rising
in the B correction that may complete as a triple zigzag. After that,
the price may start declining in the final impulse C below level 3800,
which is the previous low made by impulse A.

The ETHUSD chart displays the down corrective wave B that has been
developing for more than two years. Wave B is developing as a triple
zigzag[W]-[X]-[Y]-[X]-[Z]. There must be forming the final wave of this
triple zigzag, wave [Z]. Let study this wave in more detail on the H8
chart.

The down wave (C) consists of five sub-waves 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. There
must be developing a deep correction, wave 4, which is unfolding as a
triple zigzag [w]-[x]-[y]-[x]-[z]. The final zigzag [z] is likely to
compete at a level around 201.29, next, the price should be declining in
wave 5 to a level of 98.67. Level 98.67 is the low made by the previous
impulse, wave 3.

The [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) LTCUSD price chart presents the structure of the corrective
wave B that should be unfolding as a triple zigzag [W]-[X]-[Y]-[X]-[Z],
according to its structure. There is likely to be forming wave [Z] that
may complete as a triple zigzag (A)-(B)-(C). Let us study the structure
of wave [Z] on the eight-hour chart.

Wave [Z] is composed of three sub-waves (A), (B) and (C). Wave (A) is a
simple five-wave impulse, the corrective wave B is a bullish double
zigzag W-X-Y. There is now developing the impulse wave (C), wit the
upward correction 4 finishing inside. Correction 4 should complete as a
triple zigzag. This triple zigzag is likely to finish at 47.64, which is
the previous high, after that, the price should be declining in the
final wave 5.

The EOSUSD market continues forming the global simple zigzag
[A]-[B]-[C]. Wave [A] is a simple five-wave impulse, the [B] correction
is a double zigzag (W)-(X)-(Y). Wave [C] is an impulse that is still
developing. The final leg of this impulse must be developing now. Let us
study the structure of wave [C] in more detail in a shorter timeframe.

In the H8 timeframe, there is developing the final leg of the bear
impulse wave [C]. After the correction (4) completed as a flat, the
market has resumed declining in the impulse (5). In the next few days,
the corrective wave 4 may complete as a triple zigzag at a level of
2.90. After that, the price should start declining in wave 5 towards a
level of the previous low made by the impulse wave 3, that is level
