Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 29.04.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

Bitcoin and Ethereum could rise slightly soon. Next, the market could
start declining in a new down wave. The Ripple should be following a
bullish trend.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

After a long-term upward impulse (A) completed, the entire BTCUSD
bullish trend should be complete. The descending impulse 1, composed of
five sub-waves, must have formed at the most recent chart section. Next,
there has started the corrective bullish wave 2, which is a simple
bullish zigzag [A]-[B]-[C]. There is now forming the impulse wave [C] of
this zigzag, it is composed of the sub-waves (1)-(2)-(3)-(4)-(5). There
should have completed the corrective wave (4), and the market could rise
slightly in the impulse wave (5). After wave (5) concludes impulse [C],
the market should start declining in a new bearish wave to a level below
47237.01.

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

 ****

After the powerful bullish impulse [1] completed, there has started the
corrective wave [2] unfolding as a zigzag composed of the sub-waves
(А)-(В)-(С). Wave (B) is a contracting horizontal triangle. After
correction [2] completed, the Ripple price has been rising in the
bullish trend [3]. There have completed sub-waves (1)-(2) and 1-2 of a
smaller degree. In the near future, the market should be going up to a
level of 1.961, the previous high marked by wave [1].

## Elliott wave Ethereum analysis

 ****

The ETHUSD market continues forming a large bullish trend C unfolding as
an impulse 1-2-3-4-5. The sub-waves 1-2-3-4 have completed. Wave 4 is a
zigzag, with wave [C] completed as an ending diagonal inside. After wave
4 finished, the market has started rising in impulse 5 composed of the
sub-waves [1]-[2]-[3]-[4]-[5]. The first three parts of this pattern
have completed, wave [4] has recently started unfolding. When wave [4]
ends, the market will continue rising in a small impulse [5], as it is
outlined in the chart, to a level of 2830.00. Therefore, one could enter
