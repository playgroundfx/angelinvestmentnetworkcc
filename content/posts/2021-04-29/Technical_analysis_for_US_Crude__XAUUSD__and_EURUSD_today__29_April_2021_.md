Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 29.04.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

Yesterday, after the Fed's [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/), the short-term euro uptrend continued.
April 26 high was updated.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

Yesterday, last week's high was updated. The Intermediary Zone 63.40 -
63.14 was also broken out. The priority oil sell pattern with a target
in the lower Target Zone did not yield profits.

Today starts with a new short-term oil uptrend. Its target is to reach
the upper Target Zone 66.20 - 65.69.

In order to reach the Target Zone, traders need to break out the
resistance level of 64.30. If the resistance is held, then the price
will be corrected with the target in the Intermediary Zone 61.90 -
61.64.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

Buy when level 64.30 is broken out. TakeProfit: Target Zone 66.20 -
65.69. StopLoss: 63.45.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

The price didn't break out the gold support level of 1768 and a “false
breakout” buy pattern was formed. Within this pattern, it is possible to
enter a long trade with a target in the Gold Zone 1805 - 1802. The
short-term trend is still up.

To reverse the trend, it is required to break out level 1768 and
consolidate the price below. In this case, look for an entry point to
the sell with the target in the lower Target Zone 1747 - 1742.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

Buy in the zone of 1783 - 1777. TakeProfit: Gold Zone 1805 - 1802.
StopLoss: 1773.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

Yesterday, after the Fed's [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/), the short-term euro uptrend continued.
April 26 high was updated. The Gold Zone 1.2112 - 1.2104 was also broken
out. The next growth target within the trend is the Target Zone 3 1.2200
- 1.2184.

At the moment, the price is correcting and approaching the Additional
Zone 1.2106 - 1.2101. After the Additional Zone test, it will be
relevant to buy euro according to the pattern with the target at the
day's high.

If the Additional Zone is broken out, then a correction towards the
trend border at the level of 1.2058 will occur.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

  1. Buy according to the pattern in Additional Zone 1.2106 - 1.2101. TakeProfit: 1.2146. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. Sell when the Additional Zone 1.2106 - 1.2101 is broken out. TakeProfit: 1.2058. StopLoss: beyond the next local high.
