Central banks build trends. USDJPY, USDCHF, USDTRY, GBPCHF, GBPJPY,
EURCAD, EURMXN and EURRUB forecast as of 0...Dmitri Demidenko

If one of the central banks raises rates, then the attractiveness of
local assets increases and the inflow of capital contributes to the
strengthening of the national currency. Let's discuss how you can take
advantage of this and make up a trading plan for [USDJPY][1],
[USDCHF][2], [USDTRY][3], [GBPCHF][4], [GBPJPY][5], [EURCAD][6],
[EURMXN][7], and [EURRUB][8]

## Quarterly currencies fundamental forecast

There are always leaders and outsiders in any market. The most serious
movements occur when a clearly lagging currency turns into a favorite.
This happened with the US dollar after the Fed officials stopped being
calm and started talking about withdrawing monetary stimulus. At the
same time, stable Forex trends are formed if one of the issuing central
banks intends to tighten monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), while the other, on the
contrary, weakens it. However, the recent example of the Fed shows that
at any moment everything can turn upside down.

Despite the fact that most of the world's central banks continue to
adhere to the opinion that inflation acceleration is temporary, some
regulators prefer not to waste time, but raise rates in order to combat
the CPI growth. Brazil, Mexico, Turkey, Czech Republic, and Russia are
in favor of monetary restriction, China restricts lending, and the UK,
the USA, and Canada are talking about tapering QE programs or preparing
for them. Most likely, one should look for a favorite on which to bet
among the currencies of the above countries.

### Monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of central banks

The opposite situation is in the Eurozone, Japan, and Switzerland.
Despite the proximity of inflation to the ECB's 2% target, Christine
Lagarde and her colleagues predict that in 2022 the underlying effects
will disappear and consumer prices will begin to slow down. In such
circumstances, the question arises, [how to](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-trading-how-to/) replace the emergency asset
purchase program for €1.85 trillion expiring in March next year? The SNB
does not hide its desire to remain in the shadow of the European Central
Bank. Bern is ready to let Frankfurt go ahead in the process of monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) normalization, which makes the franc's position vulnerable.

Bank of Japan officials do not rule out the possibility that deflation
may return. They are not going to abandon the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of targeting
10-year bond yields, at least until the Fed starts raising the federal
funds rate. This circumstance holds back the yen and makes it one of the
main outsiders in Forex not only in 2021 but also in 2022.

A curious situation is emerging in Turkey, where President Recep Erdogan
is using his political influence to force the central bank to loosen
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) despite rising inflation by more than 16%. Dissenting
leaders lose their seats. Two resignations have already taken place, and
if the new head of the central bank follows the lead of the president,
this will worsen the lira's position.

In Russia, following a 125 bps hike in the key rate since March, Elvira
Nabiullina warned that it could increase by another 25-100 bps in July.
In Mexico, after an unexpected monetary tightening, markets began to
anticipate another rate hike in 2021.

Thus, based on divergence in monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), one should pay attention
to [USDJPY][1], [USDCHF][2], [USDTRY][3], [GBPCHF][4], and [GBPJPY][5]
purchases with targets at 113, 0.94, 9, 1.303, and 157.5, as well as to
[EURCAD][6], [EURMXN][7], and [EURRUB][8] sales with targets at 1.44,
22.8, and 85.
