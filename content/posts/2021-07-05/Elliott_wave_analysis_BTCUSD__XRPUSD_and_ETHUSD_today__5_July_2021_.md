Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 05.07.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

The BTCUSD, XRPUSD, and ETHUSD cryptocurrency pairs are forming bullish
waves as leading diagonals, which should finish soon.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

The BTCUSD pair must have completed forming the long-term descending
wave [A] as a five-wave impulse. Next, the market has started moving up
in the initial part of the corrective wave. There should be forming the
first wave of the bullish zigzag, wave (A). Wave (A) could be a leading
diagonal 1-2-3-4-5; it should end soon. The price should go up to a
level of 38100.00, marked by wave [2]. After that, it could start
declining.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 35379.50, TP 38100.00

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

The XRPUSD pair must have finished the first motive wave (W), which is a
part of a large bullish double zigzag. After that, the market has
started forming the beginning of the new bullish zigzag A-B-C. The fist
wave A should be unfolding as a leading diagonal. The diagonal should
end at a level of 0.760. Next, the price should start declining in the
bearish correction B, as is outlined in the chart.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] **** today:

Buy 0.695, TP 0.760

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

The ETHUSD, like the BTCUSD, finished the long-term descending wave A as
an impulse. Next, the market has started forming the beginning of the
bullish correction. There is likely to be forming zigzag [A]-[B]-[C].
The first wave [A] is about to end soon as a leading diagonal. The price
should be growing to a level of 2420.00. Next, there should start
correction [B] as is outlined in the chart.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Buy 2326.04, TP 2420.00
