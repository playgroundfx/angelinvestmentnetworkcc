Where is the gold price ceiling? The actual scenario for the coming
months and yearsMikhail Hypov

## The main factor in gold price growth, key levels, monthly and yearly
trading plan, long-term investment levels

Dear friends,

Gold has set up a new record and has already exceeded the
psychologically important level of 2,000 USD. My latest gold forecast is
[here][1]. Buyers’ targets were reached without expected retracements.
We need to update the scenario and find new targets and key levels for
the next months and years. That’s what we are going to do now!

### Fundamental analysis

First, let’s analyze the fundamental growth factors.

![LiteForex: Monthly and yearly forecast for XAUUSD. Analysis of main
growth factors.][2]

The chart above highlights two periods when the US Congress was
discussing the economic relief package. In the last case, the final
package hadn’t been approved yet, but it was clear that the associated
expenses would be covered by the printing press.

The US dollar index (DXY), marked as a red line, fell amidst that [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/)
as usual. The correlation index - the red histogram - approached minus 1
in the highlighted areas. It indicates an opposite direction of
[XAUUSD][3], marked as a blue line, versus DXY. So, the main gold price
growth drivers are an attempt to avoid devaluation risks and protection
from inflation. Let’s analyze the USD index technically and compare it
with the projected gold price evolution to see if the bullish trend will
continue.

### DXY analysis

### ![LiteForex: Monthly and yearly forecast for XAUUSD. Analysis of
main growth factors.][4]

The whole [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) of the USD index’ evolution is presented in the chart
above. The price has been changing in cycles.

The fall cycles are the following:

  1. Abandoning of the gold standard 
  2. US stock exchange crisis
  3. Dotcom crisis

The fourth cycle hasn’t begun yet. The index’s reversal could have
happened in 2017, not because of the US’ domestic factors but due to the
ECB’s tougher monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). At that time, the euro was constantly
growing stronger against the dollar. However, there were no fundamental
reasons for a collapse, and the index consolidated at 90 - 100 points
instead of starting a new cycle. A fall continuation pattern formed in
the candlestick chart. I marked it with a red circle. A similar
situation was in 74s-77s. If this year’s candlestick closes below 2017’s
candlestick, i.e., 92.29 points, and updates the minimum of 91.011
points, the pattern may be validated. Then, we should expect a new cycle
of the dollar’s devaluation against the major currencies.

growth factors.][5]

A bullish trend line is clearly seen in the monthly chart. Breaking
below this diagonal will be a strong bearish signal for the dollar. The
index chart almost lies on this trend line, so a drop below is only a
question of time.![LiteForex: Monthly and yearly forecast for XAUUSD.

However, the weekly chart of DXY shows support from the trend line. The
second consecutive week closes with a strong shadow below. At the same
time, the index has reached the third support level of the Pivot
indicator. Another signal of a retracement is information from the TD
ROC oscillator. We see this indicator is in the oversold area. All these
signals suggest a probable retracement and consolidation at 93 - 96 in
the coming weeks. The trading channel of 95.50 - 100 points marked as a
white area will resist a further ascending movement.

Thus we may conclude the US index will support the demand for gold in
the long term while a new bearish cycle is forming. Still, the index and
the dollar may consolidate the next month, and [gold][3] may retrace
from its historic highs.

### Technical analysis of gold quotes

My previous review of gold’s global wave structure is available
[here][1].

![LiteForex: Monthly and yearly forecast for XAUUSD. Analysis of main
growth factors.][7]

On 2 July, we found out that [XAUUSD][3]’s price was developing in wave
5 of the super cycle. However, wave 5 was examined according to classic
ratios because the first and the third waves had been forming regularly.
Considering long-term forecasts of DXY’s weakening and the growing risk
aversion trend, we will consider wave 5 to be long now. Following our
new scenario and [Robert Prechter’s ratios][8], we know that wave 5 can
reach 61.8% of the whole wave structure. So, the highest point of the
global wave structure may be located at 2,600 USD.

Now we have to determine how soon XAUUSD can reach that level.

To do so, we will compare the inner structure of [gold][3] price
dynamics with the USD index.

![LiteForex: Monthly and yearly forecast for XAUUSD. Analysis of main
growth factors.][9]

Considering the latest impulse growth, we see that the red pattern is
forming wave 3. XAUUSD’s growth peak reached 1.618 of the first wave,
which is a technically excellent point to start a correction. The
impulse went far beyond the Pivot indicator's limits, which is a signal
of strong overboughtness in the framework of this year. As the second
wave of the red wave structure is flat, according to the [alternation
rule][10], the fourth wave will draw down sharply, and the depth may
reach 50% of the third wave. This level coincides with Pivot R3 level.
In total, it strengthens support at 1,700 USD.

After a deep drawdown, a sharp retracement may be expected. Still, the
fifth wave’s top will hardly exceed the previous peak as the buyers’
main force will focus on clawing back lost positions.

### Forecast for this month

![LiteForex: Monthly and yearly forecast for XAUUSD. Analysis of main
growth factors.][11]

If we compare DXY’s and [XAUUSD][3]’s evolution in the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) chart, we
are likely to see gold correct already this week. The USD index formed a
double bottom and is unable to break the multi-year bullish trend
without serious preparation. The overbought yellow metal is likely to
follow the trend and start the fourth wave of the red
correction.![LiteForex: Monthly and yearly forecast for XAUUSD. Analysis
of main growth factors.][12]

So, the trading plan for August looks like the following:

  * Short positions at the current levels at around 2,030 USD. 
  * Stop Loss above the current highs at 2,075 USD.
  * Take Profit at about 1,900 - 1,925 USD.

Profit/Risk ratio: 2.43. However, considering a strong bullish trend,
the price may break out to 2,140 USD. So, risk per trade shouldn’t
exceed 1% of the deposit!

### Forecast for this year and further on

![LiteForex: Monthly and yearly forecast for XAUUSD. Analysis of main
growth factors.][13]

Getting back to DXY’s global cycles mentioned at the beginning of this
article, we see that XAUUSD is very likely to update its highs the next
3-4 years. The chart above visualizes this scenario of gold’s and USD
index’ evolution. ![LiteForex: Monthly and yearly forecast for XAUUSD.
Analysis of main growth factors.][14]

If the above monthly scenario is realized, the bearish trend of gold in
wave 4 may reach the area of 1,700 - 1,800 USD. These are the most
interesting targets for long-term short positions. In this case, the
profit/risk ratio per trade will exceed 3.5 if stop loss is placed above
2,100 USD.

Those who are thinking of long-term gold investments may check the
levels of 1,700 - 1,500 USD. None of the impulses in the gold markets
has ever done without a 20-40% retracement. It is a [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) fact, and
the current case won’t be an exception.

Good luck and profits, everyone!

Yours,

Michael @Hypov
