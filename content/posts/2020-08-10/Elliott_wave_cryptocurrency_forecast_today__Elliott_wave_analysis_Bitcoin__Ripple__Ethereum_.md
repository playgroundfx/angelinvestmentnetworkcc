The most recent section of the chart displays the final part of a large
uptrend. There is likely to be forming the bullish five-wave impulse
that is composed of the sub-waves (1)-(2)-(3)-(4)-(5). The sideways
correction (4) is currently unfolding. It should complete as a wave flat
A-B-C. Correction B should soon complete as a triple zigzag. Next, the
price can be declining in the impulse wave C, as it is outlined in the
chart.

The XRPUSD market has been forming the linking up wave [X] for a long
time already. Wave [X] is developing a simple zigzag (A)-(B)-(C). The
final motive wave (C) is now unfolding. Wave (C) is developing as a
simple five-wave impulse that is composed of the sub-waves 1-2-3-4-5.
The price is now following the sideways flat wave 4 that should complete
as a triangle. The sub-waves [d] and [e] should soon conclude correction
4. Next, the market will resume rising in wave 5, as it is outlined in
the chart.

The ETHUSD market continues unfolding the upward impulse wave A. Its
fourth element, corrective wave [4] finished not long ago. After that,
the bullish impulse wave [5] has started. The market is now following
the sideways corrective wave (4) that may conclude as a horizontal
contracting triangle. After the two small sub-waves of this triangle, d
and e, complete, the price should be rising in wave (5) to a level of
420.00.
