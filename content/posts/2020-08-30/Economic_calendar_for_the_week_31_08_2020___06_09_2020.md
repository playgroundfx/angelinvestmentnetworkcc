Economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the week 31.08.2020 – 06.09.2020Jana Kane

##  **Review of the main events of the Forex economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the
next trading week (31.08.2020 – 06.09.2020)**

 **Trading on key Forex [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/): next week we expect the publication of
important macro statistics from China, Germany, Eurozone, the US,
Australia, Canada, as well as the results of the meeting of the RB of
Australia.**

The dollar fell sharply last week, while the DXY dollar index lost
another 0.9%, dropping to the lows of more than 2 years ago near the
level of 92.40. Investors wanted to hear the Fed Chairman Jerome Powell
say something that could influence their sentiment, determining the
immediate prospects for the dollar. And Powell did not disappoint.
Speaking at the annual economic forum in Jackson Hole, Powell said that
now the Fed will abandon its [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of preempting inflation. Now the Fed
will keep interest rates low instead of raising them in advance to
contain inflation. This approach is likely to stimulate consumption and
economic growth, but at the same time will put pressure on the dollar
quotes. And since inflation in the United States in recent months and
years has been reluctant to steadily rise to the target level of 2%,
then, most likely, the same trend will continue in the future. This
means that the Fed will not return to the issue of [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) tightening for
a long time, which implies a weak dollar. It may nevertheless remain
resilient if other major global central banks also move towards further
easing of their monetary policies, as well as increasing uncertainty in
the global economy or exacerbating international trade conflicts, when
demand for the dollar as a defensive asset grows.

But for now, the dollar is declining, maintaining negative dynamics and
a tendency to further weakening, which is likely to lead to an increase
in the commodity market and a continued rally in the stock market.

The next week will be transitional between the coming end of August and
the beginning of September and autumn. It will be marked by the
publication of important macro statistics from China, Germany, Eurozone,
the US, Australia, Canada. Investors will also pay attention to the
results of the meeting of the RB of Australia, but their focus will be
on the publication on Friday of monthly data from the US labor market,
which, along with inflation and GDP data, are key for the Fed in
determining the prospects for its monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).

 **Traders should pay attention to the publication of the following
macro indicators:**

 ***during the coming week, new events may be added to the [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) and
/ or some scheduled events may be canceled**

 ****** **GMT time**

###  **Monday, August 31**

###  **01:00 CNY Manufacturing PMI by China Federation of Logistics &
Purchasing (CFLP)**

This is an important indicator of the state of the Chinese economy as a
whole. A result above 50 is seen as positive and strengthens the CNY,
one below 50 as negative for the yuan. Forecast: 48.7 in August (against
51.1 in July and 50.9 in June).

The relative decline in the index and a value below 50 could negatively
affect the CNY. Data below 50 indicates a slowdown in activity, which
negatively affects the quotes of the national currency.

In the opposite case, and if the indicator grows above the forecast and
the value of 50, the yuan will receive support and will probably
strengthen.

###  **01:00 CNY Services PMI by China Federation of Logistics &
Purchasing (CFLP)**

This indicator assesses the state of the services sector of the Chinese
economy. A result above 50 is considered positive and strengthens the
yuan. Forecast: 52.1 in August (against 54.2 in July and 54.4 in June).

Despite the relative decline, the indicator is still above 50, which is
likely to have a positive impact on the yuan quotes.

###  **12:00 EUR Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices  (HICP) in Germany
(preliminary release)**

This index is published by the EU Statistics Office and is calculated on
the basis of a statistical method agreed between all EU countries. It is
an indicator for assessing inflation used by the Governing Council of
the ECB to assess the level of price stability. A positive result
strengthens the EUR, a negative one weakens it.

In May, the HICP index (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) increased by +0.5%, in June by
+0.8%, in July - by 0%. Preliminary forecast for August: +0.4%. The euro
is unlikely to react very positively to the publication of this
indicator. If the data turn out to be better than the forecast, then the
euro may strengthen in the short term. The growth of the indicator is a
positive factor for the euro. The data indicate that inflationary
pressures are still low in Germany. The data is worse than the forecast
and the previous value will negatively affect the euro.

###  **Tuesday, September 1**

###  **04:30 AUD Interest rate decision. The RBA's accompanying
statement**

In March, the RBA made 2 rate cuts, bringing it to the current level of
0.25%, and launched a quantitative easing program. At the same time, for
3-year government bonds of Australia, the target level of yield is set
at 0.25%. The RBA has launched a program to lend to the banking system
in the amount of at least A$ 90 billion and intends to buy bonds for A$
5 billion.

The negative forecasts of economists suggest that the Australian economy
will contract by 6% in 2020, which will be the sharpest annual GDP
contraction since the Great Depression of the 1920s. The unemployment
rate is likely to rise to around 8.5%.

Some economists have talked about Australia entering its first recession
in nearly 30 years, which could turn into a depression.

“We live in extraordinary and difficult times,” said central the head of
the bank Philip Lowe. In his opinion, "further stimulation is needed."
He stated this during a press conference on March 19, when the RBA
lowered the interest rate during an unscheduled meeting.

Philip Lowe has repeatedly stated that the central bank is ready to cut
the rate again if necessary, although the likelihood of introducing
negative rates, in his opinion, is "extremely small."

The main negative factors for the Australian economy are weak wages
growth, a weak labor market and a slowdown in growth. Annual inflation
has remained below the 2-3% target set by the RBA for almost four years.

Unemployment in the country remains above the 5% level for many years,
unwilling to decline. Now another problem is the coronavirus pandemic,
which has already hit the tourism and transport sectors hard. The RBA
also expresses concern that unemployment may rise to 8% or even 10%.

In this regard, we cannot eliminate the possibility that on Tuesday,
September 1, the RBA may again cut the rate, although most economists
believe that the bank will leave the key rate unchanged at this meeting,
at 0.25%, while expressing concerns about the outlook for the global
economy due to the ongoing coronavirus epidemic.

In the accompanying statement, the RBA executives will explain the
reasons for the rate decision. If the RBA signals the possibility of
further easing of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) in the near future, the risks of a
fall in the Australian dollar will increase.

###  **09:00 EUR Consumer price index. Core CPI (preliminary release)**

Consumer Price Index (CPI) is published by Eurostat and measures the
price change of a selected basket of goods and services over a given
period. The index is a key indicator for assessing inflation and
changing purchasing habits. A positive result strengthens the EUR, a
negative one weakens it. In January, the CPI index increased by 1.4% (in
annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)), in February - by +1.2%, in March - by +0.7%, in April -
by +0.3%, in May - by +0.1%, and in July - by +0.4%, which indicates low
inflationary pressure and even a slowdown in inflation. Forecast for
August: +0.2% (annualized). If the data turns out to be worse than
forecast, then the euro may fall sharply in the short term. The data
better than the forecast and / or the previous value may strengthen the
euro in the short term, despite the low value (the target level of the
ECB's consumer inflation is just below 2.0%).

Core Consumer Price Index (Core CPI) determines the change in prices of
a selected basket of goods and services for a given period and is a key
indicator for assessing inflation and changes in consumer preferences.
Food and energy have been excluded from this indicator to provide a more
accurate estimate. A high result strengthens the EUR, while a low result
weakens it. In January, Core CPI increased by 1.1% (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)), in
February - by +1.2%, in March - by +1.0%, in April and May - by +0.9%,
and in July - by +1.2%. If the data for August turn out to be worse than
the previous value or forecast, it may negatively affect the euro. If
the data turn out to be better than the forecast or the previous value,
then the euro is likely to react with an increase in quotations, but
only in the short term. Inflation in the Eurozone remains low, which is
a negative factor for the euro. Outlook for August: +1.0%.

###  **14:00** **USD ISM Manufacturing PMI**

The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) Manufacturing PMI is an
important indicator of the health of the American economy as a whole. A
result above 50 is seen as positive and strengthens the USD, one below
50 as negative for the US dollar. Forecast: 54.0 in August (against 54.2
in July, 43.1 in May, 41.5 in April, 49.1 in March, 50.1 in February). A
relative decline in the index could negatively affect the dollar.
However, the value of the index itself is above 50, which may support
the dollar in the short term. Data above 50 indicates an acceleration in
activity, which has a positive effect on the quotes of the national
currency. If the indicator falls below the forecast and the value of 50
may drop sharply.

###  **Wednesday, September 2**

###  **01:30 AUD Australia GDP (Q2)**

Report of the Australian Bureau of Statistics on the country's GDP,
which is the main indicator of the state of the Australian economy, for
the 2nd quarter. Strong report will strengthen the AUD. Weak GDP report
will negatively affect the AUD. Forecast: -0.3% (against -0.3% in Q1
2020, +0.5% in Q4, +0.4% in Q3 2019). The decline in the indicator is a
negative factor for the AUD. If the data turns out to be worse than
forecast, the AUD will decline even more.

###  **06:00 EUR Retail sales in Germany**

Retail sales is the main indicator of consumer spending in Germany
showing changes in retail sales. A high result strengthens the euro, and
vice versa, a low result weakens it. Forecast: -3.3% (+3.0% yoy) in July
against -1.6% (+5.9% yoy) in June, +13.9% and +3.8% ( in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/))
in May.

###  **GBP Inflation report (the exact time has not been announced
yet)**

The Governor of the Bank of England and members of the Monetary Policy
Committee of the Bank of England will speak in parliament with comments
on the current economic situation and economic outlook. At this time,
the volatility in trading on the pound may rise sharply. Apart from GDP,
one of the main benchmarks for the Bank of England regarding the
prospects for monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) in the UK is inflation. If the tone of the
report is soft, the British stock market will gain support and the pound
will decline. Tough rhetoric of the Bank of England representatives
regarding inflation control implying an increase in the interest rate in
the UK will lead to the strengthening of the pound.

###  **Thursday, September 3**

###  **01:30 AUD Trade balance**

This indicator measures the relationship between Australia's export and
import volumes. Growth in exports from Australia leads to an increase in
the trade surplus, which has a positive impact on the AUD. Forecast for
July: A$ 8.80 billion (previous A$ 8.202 billion). The growing trade
surplus is likely to have a positive impact on the Australian dollar.

###  **09:00 EUR Retail sales in the Eurozone**

Retail sales is the main consumer spending indicator that shows the
change in retail sales. A high result strengthens the euro, and vice
versa, a low result weakens it. Forecast for July: +5.9% and -0.5% (YoY)
against +5.7% (+1.3% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) in June and -3.1% (in annual
[terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) in May. It is difficult to predict the euro's reaction to the
publication of these values, since the data suggests that although
retail sales declined in July on an annualized basis, they rose compared
to the previous months (March-April), when strict quarantine measures
were in force in Europe.

###  **14:00 USD ISM Services PMI**

This indicator assesses the state of the service sector in the US
economy. The services sector (in contrast to the manufacturing sector)
has practically no impact on the country's GDP.

In July, this indicator came out with a value of 58.1. A result above 50
is seen as positive for the USD. However, a relative decline in the
index could negatively affect the dollar in the short term. Outlook for
August: 57.1, which is likely to positively affect the USD overall.

###  **14:00 GBP Speech by the Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey**

Participants in financial markets are expecting that Andrew Bailey, who
became the head of the Bank of England on March 16, 2020, replacing Mark
Carney, will clarify the situation regarding the future [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the UK
central bank. Volatility during his speech usually rises sharply in the
pound trading and in the London Stock Exchange FTSE if Andrew Bailey
gives any hints of tightening or easing of the Bank of England's
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). He will probably also touch on the state and prospects
of the British economy, which has been badly affected by the coronavirus
pandemic and is on the verge of Brexit, which can still happen without a
deal.

If he does not touch upon the issues of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), the reaction to
his speech will be weak.

###  **Friday, September 4**

###  **00:30 AUD Retail Sales Index**

The Retail Sales Index is published monthly by the Australian Bureau of
Statistics and measures total retail sales. The index is often
considered an indicator of consumer confidence and reflects the health
of the retail sector in the near term. A rise in the index is usually
positive for the AUD; a decrease in the indicator will negatively affect
the AUD. The previous value of the index (in June) was +3.3% after
falling by -17.7% in April. If the data for July turns out to be weaker
than the previous value, the AUD may sharply decline in the short term.
Forecast: +3.3%.

###  **12:30 USD Average hourly wages. Non-farm Payrolls. Unemployment
rate**

The most important indicators of the state of the labor market in the
United States in August. Forecast: 0% (against +0.2% in July, -1.2% in
June, -1.0% in May, +4.7% in April) / +1.55 million (against +1.763 in
July , +4.8 million in June, +2.509 million in May and -20.687 million
in April) / 9.9% (against 10.2% in July, 11.1% in June, 13.3% in May and
14 , 7% in April), respectively.

In general, the indicators cannot be described as positive, but they are
understandable due to mass layoffs in American companies and the closure
of offices and shops due to the coronavirus. At the same time, the data
show a gradual improvement in the US labor market after its collapse in
previous months at the beginning of the year. Prior to the coronavirus,
the US labor market remained strong, signaling the stability of the
American economy and supporting the dollar.

It is often difficult to predict the market reaction to the publication
of indicators. Many indicators for previous periods are subject to
revision. Now it will be even more difficult to do this, because the
economic situation in many other large economies is no better. In any
case, when data from the US labor market is published, a surge in
volatility is expected in trading not only in USD, but throughout the
financial market. The most cautious [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s might choose to stay out
of the market during this time.

###  **12:30 CAD Unemployment rate in Canada**

Statistics Canada is to publish data on the country's labor market for
August.

Unemployment has risen in Canada in recent months amid massive business
closings due to coronavirus and layoffs. Unemployment rose from the
usual 5.6% - 5.7% to 7.8% in March and to 13.7% in May. If unemployment
continues to rise, the Canadian dollar will decline. If the data is
better than the previous value, the Canadian dollar will strengthen. A
decrease in the unemployment rate is a positive factor for the CAD, an
increase in unemployment is a negative factor. Unemployment is expected
to be 11% in August (after 10.9%, 12.3%, 13.7%, 13.0% in previous
months).
