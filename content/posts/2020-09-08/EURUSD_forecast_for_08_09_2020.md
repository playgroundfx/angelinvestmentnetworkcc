EUR/USD forecast: Euro is close to painDmitri Demidenko

## Fundamental Euro forecast for today

### The EUR/USD uptrend may cause problems to the euro area

How far will the ECB go? The [EUR/USD][1] correction down signals that
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s expect the central bank to weigh on the euro exchange rate at
its September meeting. However, Forex analysts suggest that ECB power is
limited. The euro rally mostly results from the weakness of the US
dollar. Although some members of the Governing Council believe that the
euro is strengthening because of the robust growth of the euro-area
economy, the majority believes that the Fed’s is cheating on other
regulators. The Fed’s shift to the average inflation targeting must
weaken the greenback.

The euro area must pay for the best euro rally since 2014. It should
result in the inflation downturn, weigh on the euro-area exports, and
worsen the financial performance. According to Legal&General Investment
Management, a 10% strengthening of the currency reduces the profits of
European companies by 3%, American ones - by 2%. The euro-area is close
to pain. If the euro trade-weighted exchange rate is at the same level
as now, it is not very bad. If it goes higher, it will become a big
problem.

What could the ECB do? The interest rate cut down form the current
~~0~~.5% will hit the bank system. A boost in the QE will hardly be any
good to the economy amid the current ample liquidity in the market. The
members of the Governing Council note that the asset purchase program is
efficient during the market turmoil, but then, it seems to be useless.
Is it a verbal intervention? The effect of the speech lasts for a day or
two. After that, the market again focuses on monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). So, if
Christine Lagarde tries to press the euro down, she will hardly succeed.
Moreover, if the ECB president speaks about such topics, other central-
bankers could follow her example. Not only central banks may resort to
the verbal interventions, but also Donald Trump, who already has had
such experience.

Trump is preparing for the presidential election. He claims that the US
economy experiences “the fastest recovery in US [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/)”. He promises to
impose taxes on the US companies that move their production lines
outside the US and sell the products to the Americans. Donald Trump
raises the prospect of “decoupling” the US economy from China. Trump has
also said the US would hold China accountable for the devastation
wrought by the coronavirus pandemic. The US president is also tracking
the US stock indexes. Here, he might be right. Since 1928, when the [S&P
500][3] is positive in the three months before the US presidential
election, incumbent presidents, or candidates from the controlling
party, have won nearly 90% of elections.

In August, the US stock market was 7% up, however, September is
[historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/)ly one of the worst months for the [S&P 500][3]. The stock
index was down in 54% of cases by 0.96% on average. In the years of the
presidential election, the index was 0.3% down in September. This month
is also weak for the bulls. If the US stock market continues declining,
the EUR/USD will also run down. Ahead of the ECB meeting, the pair may
start consolidation. However, if the [EUR/USD][1] breaks out the support
levels at 1.178 and 1.176, it will be likely to drop to figure 17
bottom.
