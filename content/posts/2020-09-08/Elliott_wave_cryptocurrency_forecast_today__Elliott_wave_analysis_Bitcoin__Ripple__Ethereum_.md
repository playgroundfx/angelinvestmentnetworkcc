The BTCUSD market is forming the down wave [W] as a zigzag that is
composed of the sub-waves (A)-(B)-(C). Wave (A) is a bear impulse, wave
(B) is a simple zigzag-shaped correction, wave (C) is also an impulse.
The price is now rising in correction 4, which is unfolding as a double
zigzag [w]-[x]-[y]. Wave [y] of 4 should soon end, and the market will
continue declining in wave 5 towards level 9700, as it is outlined in
the chart.
