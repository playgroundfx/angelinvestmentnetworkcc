Yen has a joker. Forecast as of 17.08.2021Dmitri Demidenko

Based on factors such as the different GDP rates and monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of
the Fed and the Bank of Japan, then [USDJPY][1] sellers have no chance
to succeed. Nevertheless, the yen is strengthening, and there is an
explanation for this. What is it? Let us discuss the Forex outlook and
make up a trading plan for [AUDJPY][2], [EURJPY][3] and [USDJPY][1].

## Monthly Japanese yen fundamental forecast

At a time when humanity is shifting from offensive to trench war against
a pandemic and facing the threat of environmental disaster, the
increased demand for safe-haven assets should not be surprising.
Apocalyptic forest fires, floods and droughts in Greece, Canada, Turkey,
China, Argentina, the United States, along with the spread of the Delta
variant across the planet, are supporting the [USDJPY][1] bears. The
pair is moving sharply towards the lower border of the consolidation
range of 108.8-110.9, [indicated in the previous article][4], against
the background of disappointing statistics on the US and China, causing
anxiety about the fate of the global economy.

There is no need to delude ourselves, believing that the catalyst for
the yen strengthening was the growth of Japan's GDP by 1.3% against the
forecast of 0.7% YoY. The economy expanded due to strong external demand
for exports and private consumption, but if Japan's main competitors
grew rapidly in the second quarter, the country was only trying to get
off its knees. The United States has already reached the pre-pandemic
level. The Japanese can only dream about it.

### Dynamics of Japan's GDP

If to take into account the divergence in economic growth, monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), or US exclusivity, then the [USDJPY][1] bears will not have a
single chance. However, they have a joker to beat opponents' trump
cards. Uncertainty around COVID-19 and the threat of an environmental
disaster keep Treasury yields under pressure. Differential rates on the
US and Japanese debt do not allow the confident greenback to strengthen
against the yen.

Due to Donald Trump's tax reform and Joe Biden's fiscal stimulus, the
Treasury's outstanding debt has grown by 50% since the end of 2017 and
reached $21.7 trillion. Even taking into account the forecast of the
United States Senate Committee on the Budget to reduce the budget
deficit from $3 trillion to $1.2 trillion this year, the figure will not
decrease. It needs low borrowing rates to service it, so the Fed will
not rush to normalize monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).

### Treasury outstanding debt dynamics

If to recall the first decline in the issue of Treasury bonds in the
last 5 years, which some [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s have already called a supply crisis,
Treasury yields are unlikely to go up sharply. The situation is
aggravated by the tense epidemiological and ecological situation.
Investors did not take on trust the rapid rebound in the GDP of the US,
the eurozone and other countries in the second quarter after the
problematic first. According to research by S&P Global, cash and short-
term liabilities on the balance sheets of corporations around the world
are at a record high of $6.84 trillion. This is 45% higher than the
5-year average.

Unless companies are increasing spending, one can hardly expect the same
impressive earnings reports as in the second quarter. The rate of the
[S&P 500][5] rally will sooner or later decrease, and the correction
will be a strong argument in favor of selling [AUDJPY][2] and
[EURJPY][3] in the direction of 77.1 and 127. The [USDJPY][1] pair is
likely to maintain its tendency to consolidate in the range of
108.8-110.9.
