Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 17.08.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

Gold trades yielded profits in the Additional Zone 1771 - 1770 which
serves as a strong support.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

Yesterday, oil broke out the Intermediary Zone 66.69 - 66.42. The short-
term trend reversed down. Now the lower Target Zone 63.96 - 63.42 serves
as the target for sales.

Now oil is trading in correction. After yesterday's breakout of the
Additional Zone 67.01 - 66.88, it can be assumed that the correction
will reach the trend key resistance 68.51 - 68.24.

Today it is possible to look for purchases from the zone of 66.89 -
66.07 with the target at level 68.24, as well as enter sales if level
66.07 is broken out. The zone of 63.96 - 63.42 will serve as the target
for sales.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

  1. Open buy positions according to the pattern in 66.89 - 66.07. TakeProfit: 68.51 - 68.24. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. Sell when the Additional Zone 66.21 - 66.07 is broken out. TakeProfit: Target Zone 63.96 - 63.42. StopLoss: beyond the next local high.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

Gold trades yielded profits in the Additional Zone 1771 - 1770 which
serves as a strong support. As a result, the short-term trend continued,
and buyers closed the position with a Take Profit. Target Zone 2 1780 -
1775 has also been broken out, indicating the most probable continuation
of the trend with a target in the Gold Zone 2 1800 - 1798.

I suggest looking for new purchases on correction at strong supports:
Additional Zone 1781 - 1780 and Intermediary Zone 1770 - 1768. The
latter serves as the border of a short-term uptrend. The local high of
the day can be considered as the first target.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

  1. Buy according to the pattern in Additional Zone 1781 - 1780. TakeProfit: 1791.7. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. Buy according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 1770 - 1768. TakeProfit: 1791.7. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

The EURUSD traders have tested the Additional Zone 1.1760 - 1.1756,
following the correction down in the intraday uptrend. Buyers should
consider an opportunity to enter purchases at good prices with the
target at the high of August 13. To enter a trade, there should be a
signal according to your trading strategy.

If the price breaks out the Additional Zone 1.1760 - 1.1756, one could
consider entering sell trades with a target at 1.1709.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

Buy according to the pattern in Additional Zone 1.1760 - 1.1756.
TakeProfit: 1.1802. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.
