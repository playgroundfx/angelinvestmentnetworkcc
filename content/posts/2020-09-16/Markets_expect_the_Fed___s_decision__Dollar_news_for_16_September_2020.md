Fed is on thin ice. EURUSD forecast for 16.09.2020Dmitri Demidenko

[EUR/USD][1] should react to the Fed’s meeting, monitor the market. At
the end of the article, I will offer trading signals and a plan to trade
the [EUR/USD][1] today and this week.

## Fundamental US dollar forecast for today

Everyone has their own truth. In 2018-2019, financial markets were
shaken by trade wars. China accused the USA of protectionism; the USA
claimed that China had been playing unfairly for years and had to take
responsibility. A third party was needed to settle the conflict and rule
which of the countries was right. That was the WTO, which has finally
delivered its verdict. The World Trade Organization ruled that the USA
violated international [regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/)s by imposing tariffs on more than $234
billion of Chinese exports.  Such a decision just a year ago would have
been interpreted as Beijing’s victory and dropped the US dollar. In
2020, however, it is seen as China’s paper win now. The USA won’t cancel
tariffs, and so, the [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) will hardly affect the USD.

The WTO ruling will add problems to the Democrats if the democratic
candidate wins the election. Joe Biden will have to choose whether to
recognize the decision of the World Trade Organization and thus ease the
policies towards China or to ignore it and continue Donald Trump’s
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). Biden’s position will influence ratings, and so, it could affect
the greenback’s short-term outlook.

The US presidential election is one of the uncertainty sources that must
be considered in the Fed’s projections. Investors expect the Federal
Reserve to revise up its forecasts for unemployment (9.3%) and GDP
(-6.3%) for 2020. In August, the unemployment rate was down to 8.4% and
it is likely to continue decreasing. Based on the US positive domestic
data, the US economy is recovering faster than it was earlier expected.
Nonetheless, the Fed’s positive projections will be a reason to buy the
greenback. According to Toscafund Asset Management, the only way to spur
the inflation rate to grow above 2% is to weaken the US dollar.

### Dynamics of inflation expectations and Fed’s interest rate

Thus, Jerome Powell should focus on the other problems, the presidential
election, and the lack of agreement for the boost of the fiscal
stimulus. He, however, should not sound too grim, as too much negative
can crash the US stock indices. The same effect is to be delivered by
the FOMC expectations to hike the federal funds rate in 2023, which is
the market is not prepared for. Investors bet on the Fed’s monetary
tightening in 2024.

Markets want the Fed to outline the rules of the new [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the
average inflation targeting. According to JP Morgan, if the US central
bank doesn’t meet the market’s expectations, giving a clue on the
further actions, it could lose a part of the reputation build in the
previous months. In my opinion, the US dollar should benefit in this
case. If the Fed wants to weaken the dollar and loses the reputation,
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s will be encouraged to against and buy the greenback.

### [EUR/USD][1] trading plan today

I believe that the Fed doesn’t have a clear strategy to set back the
bulls on the local currency as the ECB has. The [EUR/USD][1] is quite
likely to go down. The [previous trading ideas][2] are still relevant.

Remember, one could sell the [EUR/USD][1] at the breakout of the support
levels of 1.1795 and 1.1765 or buy if the price breaks out the
resistance at 1.192.
