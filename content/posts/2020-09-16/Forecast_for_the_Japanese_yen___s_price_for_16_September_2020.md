Four reasons for buying yen. Forecast for 16.09.20Dmitri Demidenko

Ahead of the Fed’s and Bank of Japan’s meetings, the Japanese yen is
certainly worth discussing. Enjoy your popcorn and remember to check out
the trading signals and trading plan for [USDJPY][1] and [EURJPY][2] for
the nearest weeks at the end of this article.

## Fundamental forecast for yen for today

Yoshihide Suga’s unconditional victory in the party race to become
Japan’s next Prime Minister, the US-China trade war’s revival and the
upcoming presidential elections in the USA redrew [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s’ attention
to the yen. [USDJPY][1]’s quotes have been falling for three days in a
row and got close to the level of 105. Rumour has it that the Bank of
Japan may get angry and intervene if that level is broken. The situation
around [EURJPY][2] is interesting too.

If Shinzo Abe’s dismissal shocked the financial markets, the information
about Yoshihide Suga’s appointment calmed them down. Let me remind you
that Yoshihide Suga is Abe’s supporter and one of the authors of the
“three arrows” strategy. The new Prime Minister isn’t going to put
pressure on the BoJ in order to change monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). He believes that
there’s no need to raise taxes in the next 10 years, and that economic
growth must improve the country’s financial state. He plans to shake up
some sectors and bureaucratic mechanisms, but at the beginning of his
term, he’ll need to recover GDP.

A clear political context is a boon for a national currency. The fact
that Japan chose its PM, while the US has yet to choose its president,
is beneficial to [USDJPY][1] bears. Still, their main trump is the
divergence in the Fed’s and BoJ’s policies: the Fed’s response to
recession was so fierce that the fall of the real US bond yields
weakened the greenback and would probably continue weakening it.

The yen is growing on the WTO’s ruling that US tariffs on Chinese
imports are illegal. Beijing approved of that. Washington got angry. I
doubt that the conflict will escalate before the elections. However,
it’s obvious that the trade war is a long-lasting subject no matter who
takes the US president’s chair. In 2019, global [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s thought it was
the main factor in market pricing. In 2020, the trade war dropped to the
4th line: the pandemic, November’s US elections and payment default
risks have become the number one priority topics.

I think the trade war subject has been undeservedly neglected. During a
pandemic, imports and exports usually reduce proportionally, and the
trade balance remains unchanged. It’s true of Canada, Japan, Britain and
Germany.  Alas, the US foreign trade deficit is growing and the Chinese
one is reducing. China’s industrial sectors are recovering faster, and
Beijing may face another round of clashes after the US election.

### Weekly trading plan for [USDJPY][1] and [EURJPY][2]

Trading wars were favourable to the yen in 2018-2019, but its fans have
other advantages this time too.  I don’t think the BoJ will interfere if
[USDJPY][1] breaks support at 105. So, we can open short positions.
Opening shorts in [EURJPY][2] at the breakout of 124.6-124.65 looks
interesting too.
