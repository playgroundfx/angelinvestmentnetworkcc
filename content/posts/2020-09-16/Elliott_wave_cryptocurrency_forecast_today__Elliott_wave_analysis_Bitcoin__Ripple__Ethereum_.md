Elliott wave [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) forecast for Bitcoin, Ripple and EthereumRoman Onegin

##  **Elliott wave forecast for BTCUSD, ETHUSD, XRPUSD for today**

###  **Elliott wave[BTCUSD][1] analysis**

After the upward impulse wave A finished, there has started a corrective
pattern unfolding as a double zigzag [W]-[X]-[Y]. The down zigzag-shaped
wave [W], composed of three major sub-waves (A)-(B)-(C), looks complete.
The market is now rising in the linking wave [X] that could finish as a
simple zigzag. Sub-waves (A) and (B) have completed, and the market is
now moving up in the final impulse wave (C). The market should be rising
to a level of 11480, where the linking wave [X] will reach 61.8%
Fibonacci level of the [W] zigzag.

###  **Elliott wave[XRPUSD][2] analysis**

 ****

The XRPUSD market is forming the down double zigzag (W)-(X)-(Y). The
bear wave (W) finished as a simple zigzag. Next, the market has started
rising in the linking wave [X] that is composed of the sub-waves A-B-C.
Wave A is a leading diagonal, correction B is a standard zigzag.
Correction B is likely to have completed, so, the price will be rising
in impulse C to a level of 0.278. At this level, the linking wave (X)
will be 50% of the wave (W). This ratio is highly likely to be reached.

###  **Elliott wave[ETHUSD][3] analysis**

 ****

The ETHUSD market completed the large upward wave (Y). Next, a new
downtrend started. There has started a down impulse wave A that is
composed of five legs, sub-waves [1]-[2]-[3]-[4]-[5]. There is now
forming the bullish zigzag [A]-[B]-[C], where sub-waves [A]-[B] have
completed, and the [C] impulse is yet unfolding. Correction (4) should
have finished within the [C} impulse. So, the price should be rising in
wave (5) to a level of 418.00. At this level, the size of the corrective
wave B will be 61.8% of the A impulse, according to Fibonacci
retracements.
