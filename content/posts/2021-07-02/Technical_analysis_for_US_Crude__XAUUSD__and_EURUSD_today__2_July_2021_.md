Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 02.07.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

The euro price is acting according to yesterday's forecast: it is
dropping towards the lower Target Zone 1.1800 - 1.1781.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

Yesterday, WTI oil reached the Gold Zone 2 75.03 - 74.76. The price
didn't break out the zone, which did not allow buyers to continue the
uptrend with the target at Target Zone 3 77.94 - 77.41.

A correction is now developing. Within the correction, the traders are
testing the Additional Zone 74.37 - 74.24. The AZ is a strong support
level, in which, first of all, it is reasonable to look for new
purchases according to the trend. The buy target will be yesterday's
high.

If the Additional Zone is broken out during today's trading session, it
will be possible to sell oil in correction with the target at the
Intermediary Zone 73.04 - 72.78.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

  1. Buy according to the pattern in Additional Zone 74.37 - 74.24. TakeProfit: 75.65. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. Sell when the Additional Zone 74.37 - 74.24 is broken out. TakeProfit: Intermediary Zone 73.04 - 72.78. StopLoss: beyond the next local high.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

Yesterday, the gold broke out the Intermediary Zone 1775 - 1773. Traders
did not provide a sell pattern, instead, they reversed the short-term
downtrend. Now the target for purchases is the upper Target Zone 1800 -
1795.

Also yesterday, the Additional Zone 1771 - 1770 was tested. This led to
new purchases, the target of which is level 1780. If this level is
broken out, the price will move towards level 1794.

If level 1780 is held, a test of support 1768 will take occur.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

The euro price is acting according to yesterday's forecast: it is
dropping towards the lower Target Zone 1.1800 - 1.1781 within a short-
term downtrend. Euro sales took place in the Additional Zone 1.1885 -
1.1881 according to the Price Action pattern. Sales should be stopped at
the moment because yesterday's low has been updated.

to the pattern at strong resistances. The Additional Zone 1.1883 -
1.1879 and Intermediary Zone 1.1932 - 1.1923 serve as the strong
resistances. The target is the day's low and the Target Zone 1.1800 -
