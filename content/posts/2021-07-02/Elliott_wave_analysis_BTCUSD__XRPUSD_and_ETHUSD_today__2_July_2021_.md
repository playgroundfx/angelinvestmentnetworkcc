Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 02.07.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

The cryptocurrency market should be declining next week.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

The BTCUSD market continues forming the fifth wave of the long-term
impulse wave [A]. Wave (5) is composed of sub-waves 1-2-3-4-5. The first
four parts must have completed. Therefore, there should be developing
wave 5. It should end at a level of 28750.00. It is the low marked by
the bearish impulse wave 3. One could enter sell trades in the current
situation.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Sell 33139.00, TP 28750.00

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

The XRPUSD market is forming the final leg of the zigzag-shaped wave
(W). In the final impulse wave C, there is unfolding the bearish impulse
(5) of a smaller degree, it is composed of sub-waves 1-2-3-4-5. The
corrective wave 4 seems to have completed, and the market is moving down
in the descending wave 5. Wave 5 should end at a level of 0.500, the
previous low. One could enter sell trades in the current situation.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] **** today:

Sell 0.642, TP 0.500

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

The ETHUSD market, like the BTCUSD, is forming the final leg in the
bearish impulse wave A. The long-term correction (4) must have completed
as a bullish double zigzag in impulse [5]. Therefore, there is unfolding
the final wave (5), which should end at a level of 1700.00, which is the
previous low marked by wave (3). One could enter sell trades in the
current situation.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Sell 2049.97, TP 1700.00
