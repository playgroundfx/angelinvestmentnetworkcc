USDCAD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 02.07.21 – 09.07.21Alex
Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions above the level of 1.2253
with a target of 1.2545 – 1.2710.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
1.2253 will allow the pair to continue falling to the levels of 1.2000 –
1.1850.

 **Analysis:** Wave (С) of 4 of a larger degree continues developing in
the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) timeframe, with the third wave 3 of (C) formed inside. The
upward correction is developing as the fourth wave 4 of (С) in the H4
timeframe, with wave а of 4 completed inside. In the H1 time frame, wave
с of 4 must be unfolding. If the presumption is correct, the pair will
continue to rise to the levels of 1.2545 – 1.2710. The level of 1.2253
is critical in this scenario as a breakout will enable the pair to
continue rising to the levels of 1.2000 – 1.1850.
