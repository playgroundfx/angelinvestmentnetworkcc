USDCHF: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 02.07.21 – 09.07.21Alex
Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions from corrections above the
level of 0.9056 with a target of  0.9476 – 0.9678.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
0.9056 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of 0.8923
– 0.8754.

 **Analysis:** Presumably, a descending first wave of a larger degree
(1) of 5 formed and an ascending correction is now developing as a
second wave (2) of 5 in the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) timeframe. In the H4 time frame, wave
A of (2) was formed and wave B of (2) finished developing. Apparently,
wave С of (2) started developing in the H1 time frame, with the first
wave of smaller degree i of C forming inside. If this assumption is
correct, the pair will continue rising to the zone of 0.9476 – 0.9678.
The level of 0.9056 is critical in this scenario. Its breakout will
allow the pair to continue falling to the levels of 0.8923 – 0.8754.
