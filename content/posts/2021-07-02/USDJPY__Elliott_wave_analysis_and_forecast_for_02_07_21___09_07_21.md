USDJPY: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 02.07.21 – 09.07.21Alex
Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions from corrections above the
level of 110.37 with a target of 113.50 – 115.00.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
110.37 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of 107.42
– 106.75.

 **Analysis:** Presumably, a descending correction of a larger degree
finished forming as wave B, and wave С started developing, with the
first wave (1) of С forming inside. In the H4 timeframe, there is
forming the third wave of a smaller degree 3 of (1), with wave i of 3
formed, a downside correction completed as wave ii of 3, and wave iii of
3 developing inside. Apparently, wave (iii) of iii is forming in the H1
time frame. If this assumption is correct, the pair will continue to
rise to  113.50 – 115.00. The level of 110.37 is critical in this
scenario as the breakout will enable the pair to continue declining to
the levels of 107.42 – 106.75.
