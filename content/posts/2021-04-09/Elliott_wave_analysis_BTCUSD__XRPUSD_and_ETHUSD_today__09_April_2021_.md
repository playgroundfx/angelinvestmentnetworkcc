Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 09.04.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

All three cryptocurrencies covered in the article should be soon rising
in impulse waves.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

The BTCUSD market is forming the impulse wave [5], with wave 5, composed
of sub-waves [1]-[2]-[3]-[4]-[5] of a smaller degree, developing inside.
The market must have completed the corrective down wave [4] as a simple
zigzag (A)-(B)-(C). Therefore, the price should be rising in sub-wave
[5] of a smaller degree towards the level of 61800.00, which is the
previous high made by wave 3 of a larger degree. One could enter
purchases in the current situation.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 58185.50, TP 61800.00

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

The XRPUSD continues forming the upward impulse, which started after the
triangle (A)-(B)-(C)-(D)-(E) had completed. So far, there have formed an
impulse wave (1) and a small corrective wave (2). There is unfolding the
impulse sub-wave (3). The market may have completed the corrective down
wave 4, so the price should be soon rising in wave 5 to a level of
1.230. It is relevant to enter long positions with the target profit at
level 1.230.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] today:

Buy 1.029, TP 1.230

## Elliott wave Ethereum analysis

The ETHUSD market is forming the final part of the upward impulse wave
C. There is now developing sub-wave (5) of impulse [5]. Wave (5) is
composed of the sub-waves 1-2-3-4-5. The market must have finished the
corrective wave 4 as a zigzag composed of three sub-waves [A]-[B]-[C].
Therefore, the price should be soon rising in sub-wave 5 to a level of
2280.00. It is relevant to enter long positions in the current
situation.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Buy 2073.59, TP 2280.00
