trading in a short-term downtrend. The trend's target is to test the
Target Zone 57.13 - 56.62. According to the previous analysis, the best
scenario for work today is to hold sales entered in the zone of good
sell prices 60.45 - 59.42.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

An important event regarding gold happened yesterday. The March high was
updated around level 1755. The Gold Zone 1755 - 1752 was also reached as
part of a short-term uptrend.

Now, major traders are closing purchases while the gold is correcting.
Prices are approaching the mirror level of 1745. The Additional Zone
1746 - 1744, which is responsible for the intraday trend, and serves as
strong support, is around ​​the abovementioned mirror level.

Holding the zone and forming a buy pattern will allow the gold to test
the level of 1757. After a breakout of the zone and price consolidation
below, the prices will go into a deep correction with a target at the
border of the short-term uptrend 1736 - 1734.

above the Target Zone 1.1880 - 1.1864. The next trend target is the Gold
Zone 1.1952 - 1.1944.

Now the euro is correcting and testing the Additional Zone 1.1887 -
