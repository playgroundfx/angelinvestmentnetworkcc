USDJPY: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 09.04.21 – 16.04.21Alex
Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 110.94 with a target of 107.71 – 106.75.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
110.94 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 112.50 –
114.00.

 **Analysis:** The descending correction of larger degree finished
forming as wave B, and wave С started developing, with the first wave
(1) of С forming inside, in the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) timeframe. In the H4 timeframe,
there is developing the third wave of a smaller degree 3 of (1), with
wave i of 3 unfolding inside. Apparently, the descending correction is
forming as wave ii of 3, with wave (a) of ii developing inside, in the
hourly timeframe. If the presumption is correct, the pair will continue
declining to the levels of 107.71 – 106.75. The level of 110.94 is
critical in this scenario as the breakout will enable the pair to
continue rising to the levels of 112.50 – 114.00.
