GBPUSD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 09.04.21 – 16.04.21Alex
Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 1.3917 with a target of 1.3572 – 1.3158.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
1.3917 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 1.4021 –
1.4237.

 **Analysis:** Presumably, the first wave of larger degree (1) finished
developing, with wave 5 of (1) formed inside, in the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) timeframe. A
downward correction started developing as wave (2) in the H4 time frame,
with wave A of (2) forming inside. Apparently, the fifth wave of smaller
degree v of A is forming in the H1 time frame, with wave (i) of v
unfolding inside. If the presumption is correct, the pair will continue
to drop to the levels of 1.3572 – 1.3158. The level of 1.3917 is
critical in this scenario as the breakout will enable the pair to
continue rising to the levels of 1.4021 – 1.4237.
