USD/CAD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 09.04.21 – 16.04.21Alex
Geuta

 **Main scenario** **:** consider short positions from corrections below
the level of 1.2643 with a target of 1.2300 – 1.2200

 **Alternative scenario** **:** ****breakout and consolidation above the
level of 1.2643 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of
1.2989 – 1.3308.

 **Analysis** **:** Daily time frame: wave (С) of 4 of larger degree
continues developing, with the first wave 1 of (C) forming inside. The
fifth wave v of 1 is forming on the H4 time frame, with wave (v) of v of
smaller degree developing inside. The third wave iii of (v) appears to
have formed on the H1 time frame, a local correction is completed as
wave iv of (v), and wave v of (v) is forming. If the presumption is
correct, the pair will continue to drop to the levels of 1.2300 –
1.2200. The level of 1.2647 is critical in this scenario as the breakout
will enable the pair to continue rising to the levels of 1.2989 –
1.3308.
