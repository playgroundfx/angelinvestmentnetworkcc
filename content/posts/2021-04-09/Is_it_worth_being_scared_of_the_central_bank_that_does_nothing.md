Fed is a silent dog. Forecast as of 09.04.2021Dmitri Demidenko

Is it worth being scared of the central bank that does nothing

## Fed passed the resistance test in March. Will there be new challenges
in April? Friday humor

The dog doesn’t have to bark to serve its Master. The dog may just look
scary, glaring angrily. In spring 2021, the Fed looks like a dog that
doesn’t bark. It doesn’t respond to the US bond market's challenge,
doesn’t discuss the [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of the US QE tapering, and repeats the mantra
that the federal funds rate will be held at the current level at least
till 2023. In March, financial markets didn’t believe in the Fed's
silence, which, according to Jerome Powell, serves the US economy well.
However, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are forced to accept the Fed’s passive attitude in
April.

In early spring, the Treasury yields rally and the weak US domestic data
resulted from the bad weather made the US stocks jump up and down. In
April, the situation has radically changed. Strong reports on the
employment and PMI, in addition to the drop in the bond yields, allowed
the [S&P 500][1] to hit a new all-time high, the 19th record close in
2021. The confidence in the best US GDP rise over the past forty years
and the fact that they won’t have to pay for the party as much as
earlier expected create a favorable environment for the stock indexes.
Fed plays the primary role in this process, acting as the shepherd.

Were the Treasury sellers discouraged? It's easy to be a brave tiger,
but try to be a brave rabbit. It is a Japanese proverb. If big money
does not want to go against the Fed, then what about individual
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s? Market expectations signal a federal funds rate hike in late
2020, followed by another 75-bps hike until the end of 2023. Aren’t they
too confident, taking into account the Fed’s willingness to remain
passive for a long time? Of course, the US GDP can well expand by 6.5%
in 2021. However, there are still eight million jobs less compared to
the pre-pandemic employment level. Until the US employment fully
recovers, the Fed won’t introduce any changes to the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).

Furthermore, the Treasuries attract more and more foreign buyers at the
current levels. The Bank of Japan controls the local bond yields, and
the ECB boosts asset purchases under the PEPP to clamp down on the
European bond yields. Asia and Europe make up the demand for the US
Treasuries, which prevents from as massive sell-offs as there were in
March. As wise men say, trust in turmoil but keep your powder dry.

It is stupid to underestimate the power of fools gathered together. The
Fed scared away the treasuries sellers, but they can well go ahead after
a pause. The resumption of the Treasury yields rally will lure [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s
back to the US dollar, breaking the stock market uptrend. After all, is
it worth being scared of a silent dog? The dog may not be as dangerous
as it looks. Will the US bond sellers start another challenge for the
Fed? The answers to these questions will determine much, including the
[EURUSD][2] trend.
