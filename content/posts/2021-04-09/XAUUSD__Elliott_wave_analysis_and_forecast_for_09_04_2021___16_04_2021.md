XAUUSD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 09.04.2021 –
16.04.2021Alex Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions from corrections above the
level of 1676.88 with a target of 1817.95 – 1851.32.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
1676.88 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of
1650.00 – 1620.09 **.**

 **Analysis:** The ascending third wave (3) of a larger degree formed
and, presumably, the descending correction has formed as wave (4) in a
[daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) timeframe. Wave С of (4) seems to have finished in the four-hour
timeframe, with wave v of C completed inside. Presumably, the fifth wave
(5) has started developing in the hourly timeframe, with the inceptive
first wave of a smaller degree i of 1 of (5) unfolding inside. If the
presumption is correct, the pair will continue rising to the levels of
1817.95 – 1851.32. The level of 1676.88 is critical in this scenario, as
the breakout will enable the pair to continue declining to the levels of
1650.00 – 1620.09.
