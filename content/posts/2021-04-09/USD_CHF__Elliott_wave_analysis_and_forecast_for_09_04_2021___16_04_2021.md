USD/CHF: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 09.04.21 – 16.04.21Alex
Geuta

 **Main scenario** **:** long positions will be relevant above the level
of 0.9150 with a target of 0.9505 – 0.9590.

 **Alternative scenario** **:** ****breakout and consolidation below the
level of 0.9150 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels
of 0.9073 – 0.8873.

 **Analysis:** Presumably, the descending first wave of larger degree
(1) of 5 finished developing on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame, with wave 5 of (1)
formed inside. An ascending correction started developing as wave (2) on
the H4 time frame, with wave A of (2) forming inside. On the H1 time
frame, apparently, the third wave of smaller degree iii of А finished
forming, and local correction started unfolding as wave iv of A. If this
assumption is correct, the pair will continue to rise to 0.9505 – 0.9590
after the local correction comes to its end. The level of 0.9150 is
critical in this scenario. Its breakout will allow the pair to continue
falling to the levels of 0.9073 – 0.8873.
