EUR/USD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 09.04.21 – 16.04.21Alex
Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions from corrections above the
level of 1.1704 with a target of 1.2024 – 1.2104.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
1.1704 will allow the pair to continue falling to the levels of 1.1600 –
1.1489.

 **Analysis:** Daily time frame: presumably, the first wave of larger
degree 1 of (3) has formed, and a downside correction is forming as wave
2 of (3). Apparently, wave a of 2 is developing on the H4 time frame
with wave (c) of a forming inside. On the H1 time frame, presumably,
wave (b) of 2 started forming, with smaller wave a of (b) forming as
part of it. If the presumption is correct, the pair will resume rising
to the levels of 1.2024 – 1.2104. The level of 1.1704 is critical in
this scenario. Its breakout will allow the pair to continue falling to
the levels of 1.1600 – 1.1489.
