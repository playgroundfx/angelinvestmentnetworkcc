Euro buys the rumor. Forecasts as of 09.04.2021Dmitri Demidenko

The euro should have sunk amid the growing number of infections in
Europe, confusion with the vaccines, lockdowns, and double-dip
recession. However, the [EURUSD][1] is rising steadily. What are the
reasons? Let us discuss the Forex outlook and make up a trading plan.

## Weekly euro fundamental forecast

Do not play against the Fed. This truth is as old as the world, but it
is still relevant. In March, financial markets tested the US central
bank for strength, pushing up the yield on US Treasuries. Having made
sure that Jerome Powell and his fellow central bankers remain calm,
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s took a step back. The greenback lost its primary advantage,
and the [EURUSD][1] has jumped above level 1.19.

The FOMC officials’ dovish stance pushed the [S&P 500][2] to a new all-
time high, the 19th record close in 2021. The US treasury yields went
down, weakening the US dollar. Jerome Powell noted that the March jobs
report was impressive but not strong enough to start tapering the
monetary assistance, and there should be several months of this kind of
reports. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard believes that monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) changes should not even be discussed until the pandemic is over,
and  San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly noted that the US economic
recovery is still very far away, and the Fed will wait until that
happens. __

The US central bank is not willing to change the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), no one
wants to go against the Fed, and the market begins to do what it usually
does in such cases - it buys the rumor. The[EURUSD][1] rally looks
unnatural amid the rising number of COVID-19 infections, Angela Merkel's
calls for stricter isolation, and the vaccine confusion in Europe, but
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are simply buying the rumor. The rumor about euro-area
economic recovery amid soon lifting of lockdowns and GDP rebound.
Germany’s factory orders data prove that the German economy has adjusted
to the pandemic.

Of course, the [S&P 500][2] cannot set records every day forever, and
the US economic strength suggests that the Treasury yields will resume
growing. Therefore, [EURUSD][1] should not grow as fast as in early
April for several weeks or months in a row. There are serious obstacles
to the euro rally, but the market usually buys what it believes in. Now,
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s believe in the vaccination progress in the EU, in the European
Recovery Fund, and in the restoration of the euro uptrend.

The higher the US stock indexes climb, the more analysts talk about
bubbles. As of late February, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s had borrowed a record $814
billion against their portfolios—up 49% from a year. It is the fastest
annual increase since 2007. The same situation in 2007 subsequently led
to the [S&P 500][2] crash, followed by the economic crisis.

### Weekly [EURUSD][1] trading plan

Most likely, the current recovery will not be as long as the previous
one, and the US economy will slide down into a recession again in 5-7
years. However, the stock market continues growing, and the euro is
going to enter a new trading range. If the [EURUSD][1] bulls break out
the resistance of 1.193-1.1935, the price will consolidate in the range
of 1.185-1.2. If the resistance is not broken out, the consolidation
range will be 1.18-1.195.
