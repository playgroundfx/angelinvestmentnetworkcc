Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 29.09.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

Bears are going ahead, the [cryptocurrency price](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/cryptocurrency-price/)s should continue
declining.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

The BTCUSD market continues declining in the new bearish wave unfolding
as an impulse. The hourly timeframe displays the structure of sub-wave
1, which is an impulse, and the structure of the corrective wave 2
completed as a zigzag (A)-(B)-(C). The Bitcoin price is to continue
falling in impulse 3 to a level below 39500.00. I recommend entering
sell trades.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Sell 42105.50, TP 39500.00

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

The XRPUSD market is forming a new impulse down wave as an element of a
larger corrective wave. After the first two sub-waves 1 and 2 completed,
the market continued falling in the third wave, unfolding as an impulse.
There should have completed corrective wave [2] as a zigzag (A)-(B)-(C).
The Ripple price should continue declining in the bearish wave [3] to a
level below 0.805.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] **** today:

Sell 0.915, TP 0.805

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

The ETHUSD market is forming the new bearish wave, like other
cryptocurrencies covered in the article. There should be forming a
descending impulse. The market is now forming the beginning of the third
wave, with sub-waves [1] and [2] completed inside. The Ethereum price
should continue falling in impulse [3] to a level below 2643.00. One
could enter short trades in the current situation.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Sell 2893.83, TP 2643.00
