Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 29.09.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

Since yesterday, oil has been trading in the correction and broke out
the Additional Zone 75.22 - 75.10.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

Since yesterday, oil has been trading in the correction and broke out
the Additional Zone 75.22 - 75.10. The price then reached key support of
the short-term uptrend Intermediary Zone 73.95 - 73.69. Now the price is
trading inside the support, without showing any reaction from buyers.

Watch the Intermediary Zone test today. If the price doesn't break out
the support, and a buy pattern is formed, then enter a long trade
according to the trend with the target at level 76.41. If the support is
broken out, the short-term trend will reverse down. In this case,
consider oil sales with a target in the lower Target Zone 71.40 - 70.89.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

Buy according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 73.95 - 73.69.
TakeProfit: 76.41. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

Gold is trading in a correction to a short-term downtrend. Now the price
is testing the Additional Zone 1739 - 1738, which serves as the strong
resistance. Until the price breaks out the resistance, it is profitable
to look for sales according to the pattern with the target in the Gold
Zone 1725 - 1723.

If the Additional Zone is broken out, the intraday trend will reverse
up. In this case, the price will tend to grow to the Intermediary Zone
1750 - 1748. After reaching the IZ, the fate of the short-term trend
will be decided.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

Sell according to the pattern in Additional Zone 1739 - 1738.
TakeProfit: Gold Zone 1725 - 1723. StopLoss: according to the pattern
rules.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

The euro is consolidating below the resistance level of 1.1687. The
trend remains down. The Gold Zone 1.1645 - 1.1636 serves as the target
for sales. Today I recommend considering sales at the current prices
(1.1687 - 1.1680) with a stop beyond the resistance level.

If the price breaks out the resistance level 1.1687 upside, a correction
to the Additional Zone 1.1716 - 1.1712 will begin. Also, look for sales
according to the pattern in the Additional Zone.

The border of the downtrend is at the level of 1.1749.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

Sell from the level of 1.1687. TakeProfit: Gold Zone 1.1645 - 1.1636.
StopLoss: 1.1702.
