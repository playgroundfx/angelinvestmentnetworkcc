Forex in October: markets are back to normal life. Forecast for AUDJPY,
NZDJPY and AUDCADDmitri Demidenko

Key events of mid-autumn will be Congress decisions on the debt ceiling
and additional fiscal stimulus, as well as the US jobs report. Let's
discuss the reaction of the G10 currencies to these events and make up a
trading plan for [AUDJPY][1], [NZDJPY][2] and [AUDCAD][3].

## Monthly G10 currencies fundamental forecast

What is happening at the end of September is a rehearsal of the October
events. The return of the markets to normal in the form of higher bond
yields and lower stock index values is a result of [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s'
understanding that the US economic recovery is complete. It is time to
move to normal GDP growth rates and normal monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). Without QE
and zero rates. However, if the shock of the recession is in the past,
this does not mean that financial markets are immune to other shocks.
The inability to resolve the issues of the public debt ceiling and new
fiscal stimulus could be the spark that ignites the flame.

The key events of October will be the decisions of the Congress, as well
as the US jobs report. According to Jerome Powell, super-strong
employment statistics are not required to push the Fed to taper QE in
November. If there is no default, then the seasonal dynamics of the
world's major currencies may be the key to the formation of strategies.

The best performance in the middle of autumn has the proxy currencies of
China, which are the Australian and New Zealand dollars. From 1975 to
2020 AUD and NZD strengthened against the greenback in 27 and 25 cases
out of 46, respectively. These currencies are among the leaders in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)
of medians, while outsider positions of the CAD and the Norwegian krone
signal that the September oil rally may end in October.

Strong euro in mid-autumn should not mislead traders. In the period from
2014 to 2020, [EURUSD][4] prices against the background of divergence in
the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the ECB and the Fed (the situation is similar to
the current one) fell by the end of the month in seven cases out of
eight.

The leadership of China-related commodity currencies may be confirmed
again in October 2021. The People's Bank has pledged not to allow a
collapse in the Chinese real estate market, so Evergrande's problems are
unlikely to affect the confident pace of the country's economy, which
the World Bank expects to accelerate to 8.5% in the current year. China
is the main trading partner of Australia and New Zealand, so strong GDP
growth is favorable for their currencies. On average, in favorable
periods, the Aussie strengthened by 2.3%, and the Kiwi by 2.4%.

The commodity monetary units are supported by the steady growth of the
commodity market. According to FactSet, the Commodities Index posted the
fastest growth in three decades in September. This has a positive effect
on the [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of trade and prospects for strengthening the AUD and the
NZD. Investors are betting that carbon-constraining policies will lead
to lower extraction of raw materials and higher prices. Let's not forget
that lockdown lifts in Australia are fraught with GDP acceleration in
the fourth quarter.

Assuming that the US default will not happen, and debt rates continue to
rise, returning to normal levels, it will be profitable for traders to
buy [AUDJPY][1], [NZDJPY][2] and [AUDCAD][3].
