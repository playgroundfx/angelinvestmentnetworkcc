EURUSD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 15.10.21 – 22.10.21Alex
Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 1.1747 with a target of 1.1287 – 1.1161.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
1.1747 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 1.1909 –
1.2269.

 **Analysis:** Daily chart: the first wave of larger degree 1 of (3) is
formed, and a downside correction continues forming as wave 2 of (3),
with wave c of 2 unfolding as part of it. Apparently, the third wave of
smaller degree (iii) of c is developing on the H4 chart. Supposedly,
wave iii of (iii) is formed on the H1 chart, and a local correction is
coming to its end in the form of wave iv of (iii). If the presumption is
correct, the pair will continue to drop to the levels of 1.1287 –
1.1161. The level of 1.1747 is critical in this scenario. Its breakout
will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 1.1909 – 1.2269.
