Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 15.10.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

Bitcoin and Ethereum must have completed impulse sub-waves, and the
prices should be declining in corrective sub-waves.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

The BTCUSD market is forming corrective wave [B] composed of sub-waves
(A)-(B)-(C). There is developing the final sub-wave (C) as a simple
impulse 1-2-3-4-5. The market must have completed the impulse sub-wave
3, so the price should be declining in corrective wave 4. Wave 4 could
retrace wave 3 by 38.2%, so it should end around the level of 52170.00.
After the price reaches this level, it should resume rising in sub-wave
5, as outlined in the chart.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Sell 59150.00, TP 52170.00

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

The XRPUSD market is forming the bearish double zigzag W-X-Y, with the
first sub-wave completed, and the second sub-wave, linking wave X,
unfolding inside. Wave X must be unfolding as a simple zigzag
[A]-[B]-[C]. Impulse [A] and correction [B] have completed, and the [C]
impulse is still developing. The Ripple price should soon reach level
1.276, forming sub-wave (5). At this level, wave X will retrace the W
wave by 76.45%.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] **** today:

Buy 1.126, TP 1.276

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

The ETHUSD market is forming the final part of the large corrective wave
B composed of three sub-waves [A]-[B]-[C]. There is forming the final
leg, sub-wave [C], as an impulse (1)-(2)-(3)-(4)-(5). The impulse sub-
wave (3) must have completed, so the price should be declining in the
corrective sub-wave (4). Wave (4) should retrace wave (3) by 50% and
finish at a level of around 3300.00. Next, the market will resume rising
in the final sub-wave (5).

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Sell 3835.95, TP 3300.00
