USDCAD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 15.10.21 – 22.10.21Alex
Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 1.2500 with a target of 1.2310 – 1.2250.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
1.2500 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 1.2647 –
1.2773.

 **Analysis:** A descending correction appears to have formed as the
fourth wave 4 of larger degree on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) chart, with wave (С) of 4
completed and wave 5 unfolding inside. H4 chart: wave 1 of (1) of 5 is
formed, and a downward correction is developing as wave 2 of (1) of 5,
with wave c of 2 unfolding as part of it. Apparently, the first wave of
smaller degree (i) of c and a local correction (ii) of c are formed, and
the third wave (iii) of c is presumably completed on the H1 chart. If
the presumption is correct, the pair will continue to drop to the levels
of 1.2310 – 1.2250 once correction (iv) of c is completed. The level of
1.2500 is critical in this scenario as a breakout will enable the pair
to continue rising to the levels of 1.2647 – 1.2773.
