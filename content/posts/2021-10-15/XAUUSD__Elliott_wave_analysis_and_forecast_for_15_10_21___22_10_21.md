XAUUSD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 15.10.21 – 22.10.21Alex
Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions from corrections above the
level of 1749.22 with a target of 1915.00 – 2075.27.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
1749.22 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of
1673.63 – 1602.20.

 **Analysis: Daily chart:** an ascending third wave of larger degree (3)
is formed, a descending correction developed as the fourth wave (4), and
the fifth wave (5) appears to be unfolding. H4 chart: apparently, the
first wave of smaller degree 1of (5) is formed, a corrective wave 2 of
(5) is completed, and wave 3 of (5) started unfolding. On the H1 chart,
a local correction finished developing as wave ii of 3, supposedly, and
wave iii of 3 started to form, with wave (iii) of iii developing as part
of it. If the presumption is correct, the pair will continue to rise to
the levels of 1915.00 – 2075.27. The level of 1749.22 is critical in
this scenario as a breakout will enable the pair to continue declining
to the levels of 1673.63 – 1602.20.
