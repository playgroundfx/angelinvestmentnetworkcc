USDJPY: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 15.10.21 – 22.10.21Alex
Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions from corrections above the
level of 112.30 with a target of 115.00 – 116.00.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
112.30 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of 110.83
– 109.012.

 **Analysis: Daily TM:** apparently, a descending correction of larger
degree finished forming as wave B, and wave С started developing, with
the first wave (1) of С forming inside.  The third wave of smaller
degree 3 of (1) continues developing on the H4 chart, with wave i of 3
formed, a correction completed as wave ii of 3, and wave iii of 3
forming inside. Apparently, wave (iii) of iii is developing on the H1
chart. If this assumption is correct, the pair will continue to rise to
115.00 – 116.00. The level of 112.30 is critical in this scenario as its
breakout will enable the pair to continue declining to the levels of
110.83 – 109.012.
