USDCHF: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 15.10.21 – 22.10.21Alex
Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions from corrections above the
level of 0.9193 with a target of 0.9506 – 0.9685.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
0.9193 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of 0.9103
– 0.9018.

 **Analysis:** Daily chart: presumably, a descending first wave of
larger degree (1) of 5 is formed and an ascending correction is now
developing as second wave (2) of 5. Wave C of (2) continues developing
on the H4 chart. Wave i of C is formed, a corrective wave ii of C is
completed, and wave iii of C is unfolding as parts of wave C of (2).
Apparently, the third wave of smaller degree (iii) of iii finished
developing and a corrective wave (iv) of iii was formed on the H1 chart.
If the presumption is correct, the pair will continue to rise in wave
(v) of iii to the levels of 0.9506 – 0.9685. The level of 0.9193 is
critical in this scenario. Its breakout will allow the pair to continue
falling to the levels of 0.9103 – 0.9018.
