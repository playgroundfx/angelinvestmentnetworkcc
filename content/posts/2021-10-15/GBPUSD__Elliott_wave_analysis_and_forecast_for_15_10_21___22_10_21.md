GBPUSD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 15.10.21 – 22.10.21Alex
Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 1.3909 with a target of 1.3157 – 1.2821.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
1.3909 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 1.4050 –
1.4241.

 **Analysis:** Daily chart: the first wave of larger degree (1) is
formed, and a downside correction continues forming as wave (2). H4
chart: waves A of (2) and B of (2) are formed, and wave C of (2) is
developing. On the H1 chart, the third wave of smaller degree iii of C
appears to have formed, and a local correction is nearing completion as
wave iv of C. If this assumption is correct, the pair will continue to
fall to 1.3157 – 1.2821 after the local correction comes to its end. The
level of 1.3909 is critical in this scenario as a breakout will enable
the pair to continue rising to the levels of 1.4050 – 1.4241.
