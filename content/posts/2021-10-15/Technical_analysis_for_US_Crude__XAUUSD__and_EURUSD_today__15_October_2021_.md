Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 15.10.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

Gold price has corrected to the support zone 1791 - 1788.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

The short-term oil trend is up. The Gold Zone 82.64 - 82.38 serves as
the growth target. It is profitable to consider new purchases on
correction at strong supports: Additional Zone 80.46 - 80.33 and
Intermediary Zone 79.19 - 78.93.

To enter trades, wait for the pattern formation in the zones indicated
above. The first target for purchases will be the day's high at 81.61.

Don't consider oil sales at the moment. To enter short trades, a trend
reversal by breaking out the Intermediary Zone is required.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

Buy according to the pattern in Additional Zone 80.46 - 80.33.
TakeProfit: 81.61. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

Gold price has corrected to the support zone 1791 - 1788. This zone
serves as the border of the intraday uptrend. It is profitable to
consider new gold purchases at this support zone. To enter purchases,
the price must return to level 1791.

If the support zone 1791 - 1788 is broken out downside, the price will
continue the downward correction with the target at the Intermediary
Zone 1781 - 1776.

The Intermediary Zone serves as the short-term uptrend's key support. So
when it is reached, it is profitable to look for purchases according to
the pattern with the target at level 1800.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

  1. Open buy positions according to the pattern in 1791 - 1788. TakeProfit: 1800. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. Open buy positions according to the pattern in 1781 - 1776. TakeProfit: 1800. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

The short-term euro trend is up. Yesterday, the price corrected to the
zone of ​​1.1587 - 1.1583. The test of the support zone was followed by
buyers' reaction and they reached the Intermediary Zone 1.1621 - 1.1583
again.

If the Intermediary Zone is broken out upside with the price
consolidation at the US trading session, then the Target Zone 1.1718 -
1.1700 will become the new target for purchases. In this case, consider
euro purchases on correction at strong supports.

To sell the euro, the breakout of the Additional Zone 1.1580 - 1.1576 is
required. In this situation, the trend will reverse down, and the target
for sales will be the level of 1.1525.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

Wait for the breakout of the Intermediary Zone 1.1621 - 1.1612, then buy
on retest. TakeProfit: Target Zone 1.1718 - 1.1700. StopLoss: 1.1590.
