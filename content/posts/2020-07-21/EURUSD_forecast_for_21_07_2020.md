EUR/USD forecast: Euro sets ambitious targetsDmitri Demidenko

##  **Fundamental Euro forecast for today**

### There should be great changes in the euro-area bond market

When in 2017 the euro surged by 14% against the US dollar, its main
growth drivers were the victory of Emmanuel Macron in the presidential
elections in France, the leading pace of the euro-area GDP growth over
the US growth, and Mario Draghi's hints at normalizing of the ECB
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) in Portuguese Sintra. The eurosceptics in Paris were
defeated, which laid the foundation for the [ EUR/USD][1] uptrend. The
current situation has a lot in common with that occurred 3 years ago,
which suggests an optimistic outlook for the euro future.

Following five days of bitter debates, the French-German emergency
stimulus plan has been approved by the EU. The grants are limited to
€390 billion, cheap loans will be €360 billion, the debt will be repaid
from the EU budget by 2058, and almost a third of the attracted
resources are planned to be used to combat climate change. The Frugal
Four managed to reduce the proportion of grants and the frugal nations
are willing to strictly control the use of grants.

The euro-area financial markets have been supported by the agreement
reached by the EU countries. Italy-Germany 10-year yield spread has been
the narrowest since March. The stock indexes have been up amid the [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/)
about the agreement on the grants.

In my opinion, the agreement on the French-German recovery plan is more
important than Emmanuel Macron’s victory in 2017. Yes, the eurosceptics
were defeated in both cases, and the euro area is again united, however,
the issue of joint bonds is a breakthrough for the entire European debt
securities market. The volume of the triple-A assets in the euro-area
bond market will increase to €1.4 trillion. Treasuries will have a
strong competitor. Besides, the ECB and the EU support for the euro-area
peripheral countries will make their papers really appealing for
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s.

The currency market and the equities market also face radical changes.
European stock indices have been trading at a discount compared to their
US peers for a long time, also because [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s considered the risk of
the euro area breakup. Now, the [EuroStoxx][3], the [DAX][4], and other
European stock indices should be growing. Besides, the capital inflow to
the euro-area financial markets should support the euro strengthening.
At the same time, the euro’s share in the world’s central banks’ FX
reserves should be also increasing. Furthermore, the current account
surplus suggests the Pictet Asset Management opinion about the
undervaluation of the[ EUR/USD][1] looks quite reasonable.

There are more parallels with 2017. In 2020-2021, the euro area can well
outperform the USA in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of the GDP growth, and its rapid economic
recovery will not require the ECB to expand QE. The talks about an early
end European QE sound like Mario Draghi’s suggestions in Portugal.
History not only repeats itself but often rhymes. That is why I should
increase my[ December forecast][5] for the[ EUR/USD][1] from 1.16 to
1.17 at the end of 2020. In 2021, the euro can well rise above $1.2.
