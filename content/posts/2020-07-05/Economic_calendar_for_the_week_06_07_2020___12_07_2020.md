Economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the week 06.07.2020 – 12.07.2020Jana Kane

##  **Overview of the main events of the Forex economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the
next trading week 06.07.2020 to 12.07.2020**

 **Trading on key Forex [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/): we are expecting the publication of
important macro statistics from the US, China, Canada, as well as the
results of the RBA meeting.**

US labor market data released last Thursday exceeded economists'
expectations. The US Department of Labor reported that the number of
jobs in June increased by 4.8 million, while unemployment in the country
fell to 11.1%, which exceeded the forecasts of economists (+3.0 million
new jobs and 12.3% unemployment, respectively ) At the same time, even
taking into account the improvement, the unemployment rate is still high
by [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) standards, and there are 15 million less jobs in the US
labor market than in February.

Now, with the release of labor market data, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s will see if
employment growth leads to higher consumer spending, which accounts for
about two-thirds of US GDP.

All three major US stock indexes ended the week with an increase of 3.2%
or more (on Friday the stock market was closed due to Independence Day).

In the coming weeks, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s will monitor the actions of the Federal
Reserve and American politicians in connection with smoldering
international trade conflicts and the need for additional measures to
stimulate the economy against the backdrop of new outbreaks of
coronavirus.

One way or another, the dollar remains a safe haven, and interest rates
in the United States remain (albeit at a fraction of a percent) still
higher than in most other developed economies.

The next week will not be full of important macro statistics. Of the
most significant events for the coming week is the meeting of the
Reserve Bank of Australia and its decision on the interest rate.
Investors will also pay attention to the publication of important macro
data from the US, China, and Canada.

 _ **Traders should pay attention to the following significant
macroeconomic data expected next week:**_

 *** during the coming week new events may be added to the [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) and
scheduled events may be canceled**

 ****** **GMT time**

###  **Monday, July 6**

###  **14:00 USD Employment Index (from ISM) in the services sector. PMI
(from ISM) in the services sector of the US economy**

This is an important indicator of economic conditions in the United
States published by the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) that
reflects business conditions in the US services sector, taking into
account the expectations of new orders, stocks, employment, and
supplies. The ISM Employment Index in the services sector is considered
an important leading indicator when the US Department of Labor compiles
an employment report. A high value of the index strengthens the USD, and
a low value weakens it. In April, this indicator came out with a value
of 30.0, and in June - with a value for May 31.8. Despite relative
growth, a result below 50 is seen as a negative factor for the USD. A
relative decline in the index may also negatively affect the dollar in
the short term. Forecast for June: 30.7.

PMI in the services sector assesses the state of the services sector in
the US economy. The services sector data (unlike the manufacturing
sector) have practically no effect on the country's GDP. The growth of
the indicator and the result above 50 are considered as a positive
factor for USD. At the same time, a relative decrease in the indicator
or data worse than the forecast may have a short-term negative impact on
the dollar.

Forecast for June: 48.9 (against 45.4 in May, 41.8 in April). Despite
relative growth, a result below 50 is seen as a negative factor for the
USD. A relative decline in the index may also negatively affect the
dollar in the short term.

###  **Tuesday, July 7**

###  **04:30 AUD Interest rate decision. RBA's accompanying statement**

In March, the RBA made 2 rate cuts, bringing it to its current level of
0.25%, and launched a quantitative easing program. 3-year Australian
government bonds have a target yield of 0.25%. The RBA has begun a
program of lending to the banking system in the amount of at least 90
billion Australian dollars and intends to buy bonds worth 5 billion
Australian dollars.

Negative forecasts of economists suggest that the Australian economy
will decline by 6% in 2020, which will be the sharpest annual decline in
GDP since the great depression of the 1920s. The unemployment rate is
likely to rise to about 8.5%.

Some economists have started talking about Australia entering its first
recession in nearly 30 years, which could turn into depression.

“We live in extraordinary and difficult times,” said the head of the
central bank Philip Lowe. In his opinion, “further stimulation is
needed.” He said this at the press conference on March 19, when the RBA
lowered the interest rate during its unscheduled meeting.

Philip Lowe has repeatedly stated that the central bank is ready to
lower the rate again if necessary, although the likelihood of
introducing negative rates, in his opinion, is "extremely small."

The main negative factors for the Australian economy are weak wages
growth, a weak labor market and a slowdown in growth. Annual inflation
has remained below the target range of 2-3% set by the RBA for almost
four years.

Unemployment in the country has remained above 5% for many years,
reluctant to decline. Now the coronavirus pandemic was added to the
above-mentioned negative factors, which already hit the tourism and
transport sector painfully. The RBA also expresses concern that
unemployment could rise to the level of 8%, or even 10%.

In this regard, we cannot eliminate the possibility that on Tuesday July
7 the RBA may again reduce the rate, although most economists believe
that the bank will leave the key rate unchanged at this level at 0.25%,
while expressing concern over global economic outlook with the ongoing
epidemic of coronavirus.

In an accompanying statement, the RBA leaders will explain the reasons
for the decision on the rate. If the RBA signals a possibility of
further easing of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), then a further fall in the Australian
dollar will become inevitable.

###  **Wednesday, July 8**

No important macro statistics planned to be released.

###  **Thursday, July 9**

###  **01:30 CNY Consumer Price Index (CPI)**

The National Bureau of Statistics of China will present data reflecting
the dynamics of consumer prices in China in May. A rise in consumer
prices could trigger an acceleration in inflation, which could force the
People’s Bank of China to take measures to tighten fiscal [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). The
increase in consumer inflation may cause the yuan to rise in price, a
low result will put pressure on the yuan.

China's economy is the second largest in the world after the American
one. Therefore, the publication of important macroeconomic indicators of
this country has a significant impact on world financial markets,
primarily on the position of the yuan, other Asian currencies, the
dollar, commodity currencies, as well as on Chinese and Asian stock
indices. China is the largest buyer of commodities and a supplier to the
global commodity market of finished products of a wide range.

In January 2020, the growth of the consumer inflation index was +1.4%
(+5.4% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)), and in May CPI index decreased to -0.8% (+2.4%
in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)).

Deterioration of macroeconomic indicators, including a decline in
consumer inflation, could negatively affect the yuan and commodity
currencies such as Canadian, Australian, and New Zealand dollars. This
is more true for the Australian dollar, since China is Australia's
largest trade and economic partner.

According to the forecast, a decrease in the consumer price index is
expected in June, but on a smaller scale: by -0.5%. At the same time,
the growth of the index in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/), as expected, amounted to +2.7%
in June. The growth of the consumer inflation index will positively
affect the yuan, as well as commodity currencies, primarily the
Australian dollar. However, a relative decrease in CPI may negatively
impact them.

###  **Friday, July 10**

###  **12:30** **CAD Unemployment rate in Canada**

Statistics Canada will release data on the country's labor market for
June.

Unemployment has grown in Canada in recent months amid massive closure
of enterprises due to coronavirus and layoffs. Unemployment rose from
the usual 5.6 - 5.7% to 7.8% in March and 13.7% in May. If unemployment
continues to rise, the Canadian dollar will decline. If the data turn
out to be better than the previous value, the Canadian dollar will
strengthen. A decrease in unemployment is a positive factor for the CAD,
an increase in unemployment is a negative factor.
