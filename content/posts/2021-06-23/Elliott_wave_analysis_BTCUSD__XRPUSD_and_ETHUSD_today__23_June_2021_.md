Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 23.06.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

The XRPUSD market must have completed forming a descending zigzag, and
the price should be following a new bullish trend in the next few weeks.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

The BTCUSD market continues forming a down impulse wave (A) composed of
five sub-waves 1-2-3-4-5. The long-term corrective wave 4 has recently
completed as a double zigzag. There is unfolding the final wave 5, which
could be a regular impulse composed of sub-waves [1]-[2]-[3]-[4]-[5].
Correction [4] should end soon, and the price will start declining in
wave [5]. The market could go down to a level of 26060.00. At this
level, wave 5 will be 50% of wave 3.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Sell 33970.00, TP 26060.00

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

The XRPUSD market must have finished forming the down impulse wave C,
which concluded the global zigzag. Therefore, there is unfolding the
inceptive part of a new bullish wave of a larger degree. The market
could be forming an upward impulse wave composed of sub-waves
(1)-(2)-(3)-(4)-(5). The first two sub-waves (1) and (2) look complete,
and there is developing sub-wave (3). Wave (3) should end at a level of
around 0.783, where correction 4 completed earlier.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] today:

Buy 0.591, TP 0.783

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

Ethereum continues forming the down impulse wave A. The first sub-waves
of this large wave have already completed. There is developing the final
wave [5] as a five-wave impulse (1)-(2)-(3)-(4)-(5). The bearish impulse
wave (3) must have completed, and the market turned up, rising in
correction (4). Therefore, the Ethereum price should be rising in wave
(4). next, the price will resume declining in wave (5) to a level of
1700.00, where wave (3) finished earlier.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Sell 1967.88, TP 1700.00
