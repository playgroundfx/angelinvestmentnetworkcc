## Main Factors That Affect JPM Stock Price in 2021 & Beyond

Factors such as earnings reports, internal conditions, industry [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/),
and global capital markets’ trends affect the whole stock market. In
this section, we will highlight the factors that affect shares of
JPMorgan Chase & Co. in particular.

### Interest Rates

Although we mentioned that global market trends affect the whole equity
market, the global economic situation affects JPMorgan Chase & Co.
significantly. That's why we should talk about it particularly.

Global market uncertainties lead to falling rates. The rates hurt banks
because they affect the spread between the sum that a lender pays out to
depositors and the sum that banks collect from borrowers. The interest
paid by giant banks to depositors isn't huge; loan yields' drop signals
a plunge of a key driver of the industry's profit.

A continuation of the coronavirus pandemic could lead to a decrease in
the stock value. In addition, other global events, including Brexit,
trade wars, governments' issues, and signs of recession, will lead to a
stock depreciation.

### Strong Reports

Earnings reports are another trigger for price movements. If you scroll
down the article, you will see how the price was [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/)ly affected
by revenue reports.

The bank has a strong position in the market. JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s
efficiency and focus on capital strength can be described by the
"fortress balance sheet" term invented by CEO Jamie Dimon. It's the
largest US bank by assets. Positive earnings reports will boost the
stock rate.

### Investments

The company is going to invest $12.5 billion in technology this year. As
the firm provides financial services, investments in the technology
industry provide a boost for the company's growth.

### Acquisitions

The company has plans to acquire new businesses to increase its market
coverage. The focus will be set on the asset management business. In the
case of a profitable acquisition, the stock value will increase.

How much will JPM stock be worth in 10 years? The [website](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/website-for-forex-trading/) doesn't submit
such a long JPMorgan Chase stock forecast as long-time predictions are
affected by many factors that can fully change the rate course. As a
result, there is no guarantee that such a long-term JPM stock price
forecast will come true.

## Price History of JPM Shares: Timeline

Why do we consider price performance? Because [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) data can
provide clues on the future price direction and explain why the price
moved in a certain way in the past. Even last month's stock movements
can help predict future prices.

The overall bullish trend started in 2015. However, we will have a look
at a few past years as the recent [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) data is more important for
the JPM stock forecast.

In 2018, the company performed well, posting 12, 13, 14, and 15
consecutive earnings growth over the [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) year. In March, the
company’s stocks set an all-time high near $118.

That year, the stocks mostly traded sideways. Then, a sharp rise
happened in July. JPM shares increased by over 10% as the bank reported
better-than-anticipated quarterly earnings and raised its dividend.

The most significant decline occurred in December. Why were JPM stocks
going down? As we mentioned above, the company depends highly on the
economic situation in the world. At the end of 2018, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s worried
about the shutting down of the system and a recession.

Only by September 2019, stocks managed to return to the average levels
of 2018. In April 2019, the rate surged around 15% due to the company's
strong first-quarter results; the firm experienced broad-based growth.

During 2019 the stocks were under pressure due to the US-China trade
dispute. Yet the company's shares managed to peak at a record high in
October after the parties signaled a resumption of negotiations.

Later, the company reported strong growth throughout the three quarters.
Return on equity was at a good level of 15%, returns on tangible equity
were even higher. Both indicators showed profitability across the
business. Overall, the company grew by 42.8%.

The coronavirus pandemic didn't allow the company’s shares to stay high.
On March 9, 2020, JPMorgan Chase slid about 14%, which turned out to be
the worst fall since March 2009. The plunge was caused by a dramatic
plunge of oil prices and bond yields. Investors worried that the sharp
decline due to the start of the coronavirus pandemic could cause a
recession. During a month between the middle of February and the middle
of March, the price plunged from $137 to $83.

The stocks started recovering only at the end of the year. However, the
uptrend has been continuing. On June 4, 2021, the price set a new all-
time high of $166.44. Improving global market conditions is the reason
for the bull case.

## Is Investing in JPMorgan Chase & Co. a Good Idea?

According to AI Pickup LLC, the price will rise within the next 10
years. However, the source is not as optimistic as Wallet Investor. AI
Pickup LLC believes the stocks will be rising until 2024. From 2024 to
2025, the price will be falling. The bullish trend will resume only in
2026. However, the bearish market sentiment will pull the price down in
2030.

JPMorgan Chase & Co. is affected by global market conditions. Being the
largest US bank, the firm can't avoid high price volatility. If the
coronavirus pandemic disappears, [JPM stocks][2] will have a higher
chance to appreciate. Until then, the shares will be under constant
pressure. Anyway, JPM shares are among the top stocks for investing.
