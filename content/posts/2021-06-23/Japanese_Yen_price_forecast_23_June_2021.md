Yen is losing ground. Forecast as of 23.06.2021Dmitri Demidenko

When divergences in economic growth and monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) help your
opponents, your success is likely to be short-term. Let us discuss the
Forex outlook and make up a [USDJPY][1] trading plan.

## Monthly Japanese yen fundamental forecast

The focus on accelerated GDP growth, and the Fed, which is ready to
allow the economy to overheat, made the Japanese yen the main outsider
of the year. Unsurprisingly, the flight of [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s due to the Fed's
hawkish stance has turned the Japanese currency into the main
beneficiary of the events taking place after the June FOMC meeting.
However, a few days later, the [USDJPY][1] price rises again, signaling
that it is too early to abandon reflationary trading.

The [USDJPY][1] uptrend is based on divergences in economic growth and
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), as well as hopes for maintaining an increased risk
appetite, pushing Japanese [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s to invest in US securities. Indeed,
while the United States and Europe are successfully tackling the
pandemic thanks to successful vaccinations, Japan is among the laggards.
This is evidenced not only by lockdowns but also by the outstripping
dynamics of business activity in the manufacturing sector over the
service sector. This is typical for the early period of economic
recovery.

Inflation in Japan has risen above zero for the first time in many
months, but compared to the United States, it is at an early stage. It
is not surprising that the Fed officials are starting to think about
curtailing QE and raising rates in 2023. The BoJ won't face this for a
very long time, and different rates of monetary restriction contribute
to the [USDJPY][1] growth.

### Dynamics of Japanese inflation

The chances of congressional adoption of Joe Biden's fiscal stimulus
program have diminished significantly, but at the same time, the
likelihood of a corporate tax hike has gone down, which is good [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) for
the US stock market. Moreover, Wall Street experts forecast 64% YoY
growth in corporate income in the second quarter. The calculation base
is extremely low, as it falls on the recession. However, the figure is
up 8% compared to 2019, which is positive [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) for the S&P 500, global
risk appetite, and [USDJPY][1] bulls.

The Fed expects strong economic growth in 2021 (+7%), and further
inflation acceleration should lead to an increase in the yield on
10-year Treasury bonds. Reflationary trading remains in place, which
increases the risks of a USDJPY uptrend recovery. The yen has taken
advantage of the market's confusion about the Fed's short-term
intentions, but it remains an outsider in Forex in the medium and long
term.

### Monthly [USDJPY][1] trading plan

In my opinion, you shouldn't give up strategies that work. [In early
June][2], I recommended entering USDJPY long trades when the price
rebounds from the support at 109.2. [A week ago][3] I advised to add up
to them in case of a successful breakout of the resistance at 110.4. I
believe that the [USDJPY][1] has good chances to continue rising in the
direction of 112.5 and 114, so the previously formed positions should be
held.
