Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 23.06.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

Oil is trading in a short-term uptrend below the resistance level of
73.20.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

Oil is trading in a short-term uptrend below the resistance level of
73.20. If this level is broken out, the trend will continue, and the
price will move towards the Gold Zone 2 75.03 - 74.76. If the resistance
level of 73.20 is held, then the Micro-zone 72.62 - 72.55 will be broken
out and the price will reach the Additional Zone 71.96 - 71.83.

Today, it is reasonable to buy oil according to the 1-2-3 pattern,
provided that level 73.20 is not tested. If the trade is closed with the
stop loss, switch to sales with a target in the Additional Zone.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

  1. Buy according to the pattern in Micro-zone 72.62 - 72.55. TakeProfit: 73.20. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. Sell when Micro-zone 72.62 - 72.55 is broken out. TakeProfit: Additional Zone 71.96 - 71.83. StopLoss: beyond the next local high.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

The gold short-term downtrend continues. The trend key resistance is at
level 1794. Look for sales according to the pattern in the zone of 1794
- 1783 with the target at the 18 June low.

An alternative scenario implies price growth and breakout of the
resistance level of 1794. In this case, the trend will reverse up, and
the target will be the upper Target Zone 1810 - 1805.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

Sell from the zone of 1794 - 1783. TakeProfit: 1766. StopLoss: 1790.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

The euro has reached the Intermediary Zone 1.1944 - 1.1935 as part of
the correction to the short-term downtrend. Now observe the sellers'
reaction and look for a sell pattern. If the pattern is found, for
example, a “false breakout”, sell the euro with a target in the Gold
Zone 2 1.1826 - 1.1817.

Alternative option: a breakout of the Intermediary Zone will lead to a
trend reversal up and the price will reach the upper Target Zone 1.2041
- 1.2023.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

Sell according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 1.1944 - 1.1935.
TakeProfit: Gold Zone 2 1.1826 - 1.1817. StopLoss: according to the
pattern rules.
