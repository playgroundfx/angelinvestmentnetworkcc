Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 15.07.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

The BTCUSD market must have started forming the final leg of the double
zigzag. The ETHUSD market should start growing in the bullish impulse.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

The BTCUSD market has started forming the upward correction [B] as the
bullish double zigzag. There must have completed the motive wave (W) as
a simple zigzag and the bearish linking wave (X) as a triple W-X-Y-X-Z.
There should be unfolding the initial part of the motive wave (Y). The
price should be rising to a level above 36640.00, the previous high made
by wave (W). One could enter purchases in the current situation.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 32699.00, TP 36640.00

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

The XRPUSD market is forming the double zigzag W-X-Y. There is
developing the X wave as a triple zigzag, composed of five major sub-
waves: motive waves [W], [Y] and [Z], and two linking waves [X] and [X].
The final motive wave [Z] is to be unfolding. The market should be
declining in the [Z] wave to a level of 0.560. At this level, wave X
will retrace the W wave by 76.4%. One could enter sell trades in the
current situation.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] **** today:

Sell 0.614, TP 0.560

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

The ETHUSD market must be forming the upward corrective wave B, which is
the sub-wave of the large bullish zigzag A-B-C. Wave B is unfolding as a
standard three-wave zigzag [A]-[B]-[C]. The down corrective wave [B]
completed, the market turned up and started rising. There must have
started forming the final impulse wave [C]. The market should be rising
to a level above the high of 2407.00.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Buy 1979.33, TP 2407.00
