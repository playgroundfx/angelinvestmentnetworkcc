Tesla Stock Forecast & Price Prediction: 2021 and BeyondJana Kane

Tesla stock (NASDAQ:[TSLA][1]) has been on fire for a long time. Its
share price rose by 695% during 2020, making Elon Musk the richest
person in the world.  The Tesla Motors stock value is included on major
US indices, such as NASDAQ and the S&P 500 Index.

[Tesla][2] is the undisputed leader in electric vehicles (EVs) anyway.
It remains to be seen whether this will still be the case in the coming
years in a market where many other brands are also strongly producing
their own EVs. One thing is certain: electric cars are the future and a
fast-growing segment of car sales, which is evident from the Tesla share
forecast.

The article covers the following subjects:

The ticker symbol “TSLA” stock is slated to become the most talked-about
stock of 2021 and perhaps also in 2022. TSLA is probably the most
pressed symbol on any investment platform. The Tesla share price
forecast has risen so much that some [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are afraid of heights. Is
this right? Or are they just missing an opportunity out of a thousand?
We’ll take a look at it in this Tesla stock price prediction and
financial outlook.

## A Short History of Tesla

Tesla first went public in 2010, offering its 13.3 million [Tesla
shares][2] for just $17 per share. Now here's the fact; at the time of
writing this post (February 14, 2021), Tesla's stock is valued at over
$800! This represents an increase of about 50x in a short period of time
of just 10 years! With a market cap of approximately $800 billion, there
is no doubt that Tesla is the world's largest automaker by value, even
outperforming giant premium brands such as Toyota and General Motors.

While the entire world suffered from the economic effects of COVID-19,
Tesla reported a sharp 71% increase in vehicle production in the fourth
quarter compared to the same quarter last year. Most people thought
Tesla's goal of producing 500,000 vehicles by 2020 was nearly
impossible. The California carmaker almost managed to reach its target
by producing 499,647 cars by 2020.

2021 doesn’t seem to be so positive for Tesla stocks. Although the
shares reached an [all-time high][3] on January 26, 2021, when the
closing price was $883.09, since then the price is only declining. The
stock has decreased by over 10% year-to-date in the first half of 2021.
For example, the S&P 500 index is up by more than 15%, Ford has
increased by around 80%  and GM rose  by 50%. The current price of Tesla
stock (NASDAQ:[TSLA][1]) is $650.64.

The decline is caused by a change in [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) sentiment. They re-invest
funds from high-growth stocks into value and cyclical stocks due to the
signs of economic reopening.

However, the company does everything possible to push its stock price.
For example, Tesla plans to grow aggressively, expanding deliveries by
more than 50% each year over a multi-year horizon. Production facilities
in Berlin and Texas, expected to be open by the end of  2021 or at the
beginning of 2022, and the introduction of the Cybertruck, Tesla’s new
pickup, are likely to boost near-term growth.

## Tesla Stock Price Today

On the chart below you can always track the current price, updated
online. Also, it’s possible to do technical analysis, using various
indicators (for instance, stock trading volume) and tools that will save
you time.



## Tesla Stock Forecast: Price Predictions by Experts

According to the 12-month price forecast based on opinions of 26
analysts, the average projection is $650.92, maximum forecast is
$1,200.00, and minimum forecast is $137.00.

As for analyst recommendations, 8 analysts out of 28 still recommend
strong buy, 3 analysts are for buy, 14 analysts are not sure about the
future price direction and recommend holding stocks, 1 expert gives
advice to sell, and 2 analysts are for strong sell.

### Ryan Brinkman, JP Morgan

Ryan Brinkman at JP Morgan kept the strong sell rating but raised the
price target to $160 from $155. This prediction is very pessimistic for
Tesla shares.

### Patrick Hummel, UBS

Patrick Hummel at UBS is also negative about Tesla’s future price.
Although he targets a price of $660, it’s below the previous forecast of
$730, the rating is to hold.

### Jed Dorsheimer, Canaccord Genuity

Jed Dorsheimer at Canaccord Genuity is more optimistic about estimated
stock growth. Although the average price target was set below the
previous forecast ($812 vs. $974), the analyst maintains a strong buy
rating.

### Colin Langan, Wells Fargo

### Dan Levy at Credit Suisse

Dan Levy at Credit Suisse sets the expected price at $800, but says to
hold the stocks. Thus, Tesla stocks may be not the best investment.

Some even think that these predictions may ultimately be conservative.
There were many doubts when Tesla announced last year that it wanted to
deliver half a million vehicles. By 2020, the company had produced
509,727 vehicles and delivered 499,550. It just barely missed its
somewhat daring prognosis.

In conjunction with its recent earnings report, Tesla communicated the
following: “Over the next few years, we expect an average annual growth
of 50% in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of vehicle delivery. In some years, we can grow faster,
which is expected to be the case in 2021.” If that forecast gets even
close to reality, the Tesla stock forecast could go much higher.

No share [rose in value][4] as much in 2020 as Tesla's did. CEO Elon R.
Musk did not do any harm. Thanks to his Tesla shares, he can now call
himself the richest man in the world.

## Tesla Stock Technical Analysis

We'll start our [Tesla][5] stock technical analysis with the
determination of global trends and key levels on the one-month time
frame.

There has been a strongly marked bullish trend since mid-2019. Local
lows and highs are growing. Even September's 5-for-1 stock split didn't
affect the general bullish pattern, although the chart registered a bad
fall. Trading activity's growth confirms Tesla stock's solid bullish
potential. The chart above shows that trading volumes are high and
continue growing.

Now let's determine the key levels. The nearest support value is the
level of 380 US dollars. Last year, the chart approached that level many
times but never consolidated below it.

The nearest resistance level is at February 2020's local low of 968 USD.
Crossing that level would break the psychological barrier of 1,000 USD
and indirectly confirm the projected growth potential.

### TSLA stock forecast for next three months

To have a more accurate forecast of the price's future movement, let's
conduct a technical analysis of [TSLA][5]'s weekly price chart.

The MACD, RSI, and [Bollinger Bands](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/bollinger-bands.html) indicate that TSLA shares are trading
sideways in the chart above.

The indicators' values marked with blue circles indirectly confirm those
signals.

  * [Bollinger Bands](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/bollinger-bands.html) narrowed to their extreme values, which also indicates a flat market. The price [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) hasn't seen a tapering that big since the end of 2019.

  * RSI is near zero, and there aren't any preconditions for it to move to overbought/oversold zones.

  * MACD has been flatting for a whole year as well. If the zero line is crossed from below, we may have a powerful signal of a further uptrend.

So, Tesla's projected trading range for the next three months is between
the trend line and the resistance level (green line): the low is 475
USD, and the high is 1,000 USD.

There might be a breakout of the resistance level at 1,000 USD in an
alternative scenario. In that case, a new target will be the previous
local high at 2,318. However, based on the technical analysis we have
just done, the alternative scenario is unlikely to be realized in the
nearest three months.

### What will be the price of TSLA shares in 2021?

To make a realistic forecast for Tesla stocks for each month of 2021,
let's analyze the TSLA [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) chart by drawing projections of an expected
price range using [Bollinger Bands](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/bollinger-bands.html).

The market is expected to be flatting and probably approaching the trend
line until the end of summer 2021. The stock's estimated value will go
from 480 USD to 790 USD. Next, there might start bullish sentiment, and
the chart might continue developing in the direction of the main trend.
A breakout of the key level of 968 and consolidation above 1,000 USD
will mean the uptrend continues. That may happen at the end of 2021.

The table below provides minimum and maximum values of Tesla's expected
price for each month.

The Economy Forecast Agency is not so optimistic about the next year.
The price will also rise, but more slowly. The closing price for
December 2022 is $1,213. Still, 2023 seems to be more promising for
Tesla stocks, according to the source. Although the [website](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/website-for-forex-trading/) provides
forecasts only for the first seven months of 2023, the projected stock
price for the end of July is 1,630 US dollars.

Coin Price Forecast is more optimistic about the future of [Tesla
shares][9]. However, the outlook was reviewed significantly. The source
doesn’t expect the stock rate to skyrocket to $10,000. The change in the
projection is based on the weak stock performance in the first half of
2021.

At the beginning of 2025, the price will be near $2,000 ($1,934). By the
year’s end the rate will reach $2,367. In the middle of 2027, the price
will cross a psychological level of $3,000. By the end of 2030, the
price will be at $3,650. Although the growth in value is not
significant, a small uptrend is better than a downtrend.

Billionaire [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) Ron Baron [believes][11] Tesla, Inc (the company)
could be worth $1.5 trillion by 2030.

Please note that such long-term forecasts are very approximate, are
considered speculation, and are never reliable investment advice, as
they are updated on a [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) basis.

## How Has the Price of Tesla stock Changed Over Time?

In order for analysts to make a realistic and reliable Tesla stock
prediction, it's essential to look back at how the commodity performed
during the previous years of its existence. Below is a NASDAQ chart that
shows how the Tesla stock value has changed since the company was
founded. Notice the major price explosion around 2020!



As the most significant price fluctuations started in 2020, we will
consider the events that affected the price from 2020 to 2021.

In February 2020, the price rallied over 100% since the beginning of the
year. However, there were no specific factors that should have boosted
the price to such highs. In January, the company reported strong
quarterly earnings data. As a result, stocks increased 13% in after-
hours trading.

Another factor that could have pushed the price up was price targets set
by analysts. For example, when Argus Research updated its price target
to $808 on February 3, the stock rate skyrocketed 19%. Shares also
reacted to the opinion of billionaire [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) Ron Baron who
claimedTesla’s revenue could reach $1 trillion in the next decade. In
the end, the shares jumped 13%.

After the coronavirus came into effect, the stocks lost value. The price
was again below $100. However, the downtrend soon ended . The robust
bullish trend lasted from the beginning of April until September 1.

On August 31, the company held a 5-to-1 split. As a result, the closing
price reached its then highest level of $498.32. However, on September
8,Tesla shares suffered their largest loss since going public. The
plunge could be caused by the [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) that the S & P 500 index didn’t
include Tesla stocks in the index. The market was shocked. From then
until the middle of December 2020, the stocks traded sideways.

In the new year Tesla stocks started with a new high. As a result, Tesla
Inc. became the world's most valuable carmaker. On January 26, the
shares set an all-time high of $883.09.

The rally finished in the beginning of February. Analysts named several
reasons. Firstly, the company had a weak earnings report. Critics
considered it as proof that the company couldn’t make money building and
selling cars. Increased competition could become the second reason for
the stock decline. Tesla’s competitors set ambitious targets for EV
sales. The third reason may be hidden in the case with its cheapest
version of its Model Y and its best-selling Model 3 cars. The company
cut their price by $2,000 each. In a week, the "standard range" version
of the Model Y disappeared from Tesla's site. The company didn’t provide
comments.

Since the beginning of March, the price has been moving sideways without
significant ups and downs.

## Factors That Can Affect the Tesla Stock Price

The price of a share mainly depends on the attitude of the [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s to
the issuing company. Among the most important factors that will
influence a stock's price are expectations about the company's results.
The demand for Tesla shares on the stock exchange depends on the
analysts' predictions about the company's profit (or loss).

A company can also increase its value in the market through the assets
it owns. Just think of, for example, a patent, a real estate portfolio,
a sales exclusivity. Innovation also plays an important role in the
success of a company.

Stock market predictions and prices are also influenced by the level and
expected evolution of interest rates. After all, at low interest rates,
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s will dare to take more risks to obtain higher returns and find
their way to the stock exchange more easily.

The sector in which a company operates is also a factor that can cause
its price to fluctuate. A healthy company in a sector in difficulty will
be negatively impacted by the image of the sector on the market. We are
thinking here of the financial values ​​that have become much less
credible after the crisis in 2008. And the value of Tesla shares on the
stock exchange can also rise or fall due to a radical change that the
sector is experiencing. A new product that is released or new habits
that consumers adopt are factors that can determine the evolution of a
share's value. Another great opportunity is the consolidation of a
sector. A company that acquires other companies in the same sector can
establish itself as a market leader and occupy a dominant position
there.

In a broader context, the general evolution of the markets can increase
or decrease the value of a security. In gloomy markets, as we have known
them during the financial crises of 2008 and 2011, even healthy and
promising values ​​were sucked into a downward spiral when there was
fundamentally nothing wrong with them. In periods of euphoria, the
entire market takes part in the increase without being economically
justified.

Major economic and political trends can also trigger panic or calm on
the stock market and sweep an entire market up or down due to favorable
or troubling macroeconomic fundamental occurrences. A country's fiscal,
budgetary and especially monetary measures are more likely to reassure
or worry [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s.

Consumer habits can also play a role in the potential evolution of a
stock price, as with the Tesla stock prediction. Some opportunities are
cyclical. Certain sectors that have had to implement restructuring can
get out of a cycle of less growth due to more consolidation. Other
opportunities are more structural. This is the case, for example, for
companies active in education. As emerging countries transition from a
predominantly agricultural culture to an industrial and service economy,
there is a structural need to improve the educational system. There may
then be a strong demand for these companies on the stock exchange.

Some companies are also more sensitive than others to the evolution of
the currency. A company that derives a large part of its turnover from
exports will experience a rise or fall in the currencies on its
turnover, profitability, and stock market price.

As we can see, the stock market price will therefore depend on internal
factors: balance sheet structure, profitability, earnings expectations,
the share of turnover in exports, capacity to innovate, position in the
market relative to competitors, assets. But this evolution will also
depend on external factors: the political and macroeconomic situation,
as well as the evolution and the perception of the sector in which the
company operates. All these factors must, therefore, be correctly
approached and analyzed by the [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/).

## What Is the Future Price of Tesla Stocks? Are Tesla Stocks a Good
Investment?

[Tesla][2] was one of the few companies operating in 2020 that managed

electric vehicle manufacturer is a huge brand in today's world. The
company specializes in manufacturing "future cars" that do not require

its earnings quarter after quarter. Tesla has grown into the largest
producer of high-tech cars in the world. Anyone dealing with the
industry in one way or another knows the name of the company. If it
continues like this with Tesla, there is no doubt that its shareholders
will make huge profits in the future. So, what is the Tesla (TSLA) stock

During the frenzied pandemic times of 2020, it is nearly impossible to
believe that while other companies struggled to stay in the market,
Tesla's stock rose nearly 700%! This means that if you had invested
$10,000 in Tesla in 2019, your investment would have become over 80,000
by 2021! It sounds crazy, right? Well, these numbers are nothing yet.
The company says it plans to increase its production by nearly 50% in
2021.

Such an increase means that shareholders get even more profit from Tesla
shares. The company generated a whopping $31.5 billion in total revenue
in 2020, which was more than enough to push its total value above $800
billion. Having numbers like that means the company has tremendous
potential to take on Apple and Google as it aims to hit $1 trillion very
soon!

However, buying Tesla stock now may not be the best decision. The weak
trend at the beginning of the year and low analyst forecasts make us
think about waiting for the end of 2021. If you’re wondering “should I
invest in Tesla?”. It's worth considering stock trading. Do it with a
reputable exchange/broker. A good example of this is LiteForex. A great
