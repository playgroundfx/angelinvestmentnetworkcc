Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 16.04.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

All the three cryptocurrencies covered in the article should be
declining in prices over the next few days.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

There is developing the large ending diagonal 5, with the fourth wave
unfolding within. The bearish corrective wave [4] is likely to end a
simple zigzag (A)-(B)-(C). The zigzag-shaped correction (B) may have
completed, and the price should be declining in the (C) impulse. The
market is likely to be declining to a level of 57670.00. At this level,
wave [4] will be 50% of the upward wave [3]. One could enter short
trades in the current situation.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Sell 62070.00, TP 57670.00

* * *

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

The XRPUSD market has completed a strong impulse wave (3). Next, the
market has turned down and started declining in the corrective wave (4).
This correction could be unfolding as a regular zigzag A-B-C. The
zigzag-shaped wave B may have completed, so the market should be
declining in the final impulse sub-wave C. The entire correction (4)
could end at a level of 1.412, where wave (4) will be 38.2% of impulse
(3).

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] today:

Sell 1.694, TP 1.412

* * *

## Elliott wave Ethereum analysis

The most recent chart section displays the final part of the upward
impulse C. The C impulse must have finished, as its final impulse sub-
wave looks complete. Therefore, there is developing a new bearish trend
now. The price should be declining to a level below the previous low of
2096.00, made by correction [4]. One could enter sell trades in the
current situation.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Sell 2435.70, TP 2096.00
