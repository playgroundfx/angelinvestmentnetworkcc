XAUUSD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 16.04.21 – 23.04.21Alex
Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions from corrections above the
level of 1722.83 with a target of 1817.95 – 1851.32.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
1722.83 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of
1675.55 – 1650.00.

 **Analysis:** The ascending third wave of larger degree (3) formed on
the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame, and a descending correction developed as wave (4),
supposedly. Wave С of (4) appears to have formed on the H4 time frame,
with wave v of C completed as part of it. Supposedly, the fifth wave (5)
started developing on the H1 time frame. The first counter-trend wave of
smaller degree i of 1 of (5) and corrective wave ii of 1 of (5) are
completed as parts of the fifth wave (5). If the presumption is correct,
the pair will continue to rise to the levels of 1817.95 – 1851.32. The
level of 1722.83 is critical in this scenario as the breakout will
enable the pair to continue declining to the levels of 1675.55 –
1650.00.
