EURUSD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 16.04.21 – 23.04.21Alex
Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions from corrections above the
level of 1.1704 with a target of 1.2104 – 1.2238.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
1.1704 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of 1.1600
– 1.1489.

 **Analysis:** presumably, the first wave of larger degree 1 of (3) has
formed on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame, and a downside correction is forming as
wave 2 of (3). Wave a of 2 appears to have developed on the H4 time
frame, with wave (c) of a formed inside. Apparently, wave b of 2 started
forming on the H1 time frame, with wave (a) of b of smaller degree
formed inside. If the presumption is correct, the pair may be expected
to continue rising to the levels of 1.2104 – 1.2238. The level of 1.1704
is critical in this scenario. Its breakout will allow the pair to
continue falling to the levels of 1.1600 – 1.1489.
