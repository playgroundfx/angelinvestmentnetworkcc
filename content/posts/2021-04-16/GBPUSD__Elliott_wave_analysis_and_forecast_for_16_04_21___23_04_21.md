GBPUSD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 16.04.21 – 23.04.21Alex
Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions from corrections above the
level of 1.3660 with a target of 1.3947 – 1.4017.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
1.3660 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of 1.3572
– 1.3158.

 **Analysis:** Daily time frame: presumably, the first wave of larger
degree (1) finished developing, with wave 5 of (1) formed inside. A
descending correction started developing as wave (2) on the H4 time
frame, with wave A of (2) formed inside. Apparently, wave B of (2)
started developing on the H1 time frame, with wave a of B forming
inside. If this assumption is correct, the pair will continue to rise to
1.3947 – 1.4017. The level of 1.3660 is critical in this scenario as its
breakout will enable the pair to continue declining to the levels of
1.3572 – 1.3158.
