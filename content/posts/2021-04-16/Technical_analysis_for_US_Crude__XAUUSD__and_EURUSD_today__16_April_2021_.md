Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 16.04.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

Yesterday, the oil purchase in the Margin Zone 62.25 - 62.12 yielded
profit.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

Yesterday, the oil purchase in the Margin Zone 62.25 - 62.12 yielded
profit. As a result, the previous day's high was updated. Now the bulls
are trying to consolidate the price above the medium-term resistance
level of 63.26 - 62.75. If successful, the next target will be the Gold
Zone 65.55 - 65.30.

Today, it is profitable to look for new WTI oil purchases on correction
at strong supports. The current high can be used as a target.

If the price breaks out the support level of 62.50, a sell reversal
pattern will appear, which can be used to sell oil with the target at
the border of the short-term uptrend 61.37 - 61.11.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

Open buy positions according to the pattern in 62.86 - 62.50.
TakeProfit: 63.80. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

The trading recommendation to buy the gold above the level of 1748
worked out. All targets of the short-term uptrend have been met. The
price closed above the Gold Zone 1755 - 1752 at the US trading session.
This means that the next trend target is Target Zone 2 1782 - 1777.

It is reasonable to look for new purchases according to the pattern in
the zone of 1757 - 1755 and in the trend key support 1744 - 1742.
Yesterday's high 1767 can be used as a target to take a part of the
profit.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

  1. Open buy positions according to the pattern in 1757 - 1755. TakeProfit: 1767. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. Buy according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 1744 - 1742. TakeProfit: 1767. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

Yesterday, the euro price returned below the level of 1.1970. The
traders have reached the Additional Zone 1.1953 - 1.1949, which is
responsible for the intraday uptrend's border. Until the price breaks
out the zone, it is profitable to consider the euro purchases with the
target at level 1.1986.

As soon as the Additional Zone is broken out, it will be possible to
sell the euro with the target at the trend border 1.1913 - 1.1905. In
this case, it is reasonable to place a stop loss above the next local
high.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

  1. Buy according to the pattern in Additional Zone 1.1953 - 1.1949. TakeProfit: 1.1986. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. Sell when the Additional Zone 1.1953 - 1.1949 is broken out. TakeProfit: Intermediary Zone 1.1913 - 1.1905. StopLoss: 1.1973.
