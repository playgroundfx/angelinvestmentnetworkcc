Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 25.05.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

Yesterday, the short-term oil trend reversed up by breaking out the key
resistance 64.43 - 64.16.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

Yesterday, the short-term oil trend reversed up by breaking out the key
resistance 64.43 - 64.16. Now traders' target is to test the upper
Target Zone 67.34 - 66.81.

It is reasonable to look for oil purchases on the correction in the zone
of 64.92 - 63.33. It is most profitable to wait for a pattern to appear
in the beforementioned zone and enter a long trade with the first target
at today's high.

It is too early to talk about sales. To open short trades, it is
necessary to reverse the trend down again by breaking out the level of
63.33.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

Open buy positions according to the pattern in 64.92 - 63.33.
TakeProfit: 66.11, Target Zone 67.34 - 66.81. StopLoss: according to the
pattern rules.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

The short-term gold uptrend continues. Yesterday, the price consolidated
above the Gold Zone 1878.5 - 1876.2 at the US trading session. The next
growth target is Target Zone 2 1903 - 1898.

Now the gold price is correcting and testing the support zone 1878 -
1872. It is profitable to consider purchases in the beforementioned
support zone with the first target at level 1888.

The trend border is at the level of 1863. If the bears manage to break
it out, the short-term trend will reverse down, and the target for sales
will be the lower Target Zone 1844 - 1839.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

Open buy positions according to the pattern in 1878 - 1872. TakeProfit:
1888, Target Zone 2 1903 - 1898. StopLoss: according to the pattern
rules.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

Yesterday, the short-term euro uptrend continued, and the price tested
the Target Zone 1.2245 - 1.2227. Now, traders are preparing to break out
the resistance level of 1.2239. If successful, the next target will be
Gold Zone 1.2324 - 1.2315.

To sell the euro, a trend reversal down is required. To do this the
traders need to break out the Intermediary Zone 1.2157 - 1.2148 and
consolidate the price below.
