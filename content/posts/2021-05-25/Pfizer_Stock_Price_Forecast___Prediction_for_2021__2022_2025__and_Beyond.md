Pfizer Stock Forecast: Is It a Great Stock to Buy?Jana Kane

Investors have been eyeing Pfizer stocks ever since the company began
shipments and became part of a mass vaccination program. Some puzzled by
the market’s treatment of Pfizer, having expected the prices to
skyrocket. So far, the shares have had a slow-and-steady status rather
than spectacular surges.

 ****

Still, the company’s future outlook seems bright, making [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s
wonder whether they should jump in right now. Will Pfizer’s stock go up?
Find out in this Pfizer stock price forecast!

The article covers the following subjects:

## About the Pfizer Stock

[Pfizer][1] (NASDAQ: PFE) traces its origins to 1849, but it finally became a publicly-traded company in 1942, nearly a century after its founding. The $5.9 million IPO was one of the largest of that year, with shares valued at a price of $24.75 apiece. On the very first day, the company reached the market cap of $12.4 million.

At the time of its incorporation, the chemical enterprise was valued at
$2 million. Today, the market cap has reached $215 billion, and it’s
still one of the largest manufacturers and distributors of
pharmaceuticals, agricultural and animal health products, pharmaceutical
chemicals, nutritional products, and items for personal, household, and
industrial use.

Currently, Pfizer is a component of the following U.S. stock market
indices:

## Main Factors That Drive Pfizer (PFE) in 2021 & In the Future

There is no clean equation that tells us exactly where the [Pfizer stock
price][1] will go, or any stock price, for that matter. That said, we
can pinpoint a few things about the forces that move PFE stock.

### Everything Vaccine-Related

An 11-figure revenue outlook in 2021 is not far-fetched. Although, it
depends on how quickly Pfizer can produce and distribute its COVID-19
vaccine. Plus, there are many indirect factors that may change the
Pfizer stock forecast:

  * Long-term safety profile of COVID-19 vaccines;

  * Duration of immunity;

  * Effectiveness compared to the Moderna and other vaccines, especially if Pfizer’s vaccine works better;

  * Risk of variants that can evade vaccine-induced immunity;

  * Untested COVID-19 vaccine regimens.

### Research and Development Potential

Pfizer keeps its pipeline of experimental first products and early
commercial-stage drugs full. This is a crucial fundamental factor in the
PEE stock prediction. In the last few months alone, the company made
many exciting announcements, including:

  * Extension of review of Abrocitinib’s new application for the treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis;

  * Application for Tanezumab as a treatment of osteoarthritis pain;

  * Initiation of phase 2 study for a Lyme disease vaccine candidate;

  * Pivotal Phase 2 MagnetisMM-3 trial of BCMA-CD3 bispecific antibody Elranatamab (PF-06863135) in multiple myeloma.

All of these combined make a compelling argument in favor of projected
growth.

### Cash Flows

After spinning off assets from its Upjohn unit into Viatris, Pfizer
expects cash flow from its slimmed-down operations to reach at least $10
billion in 2021. This will give them more chances to invest in potential
new sources of revenue.

Pfizer’s stockholders automatically receive distributed shares of the
Viatris stock, but Pfizer is doing great even without big cash
injections from Viatris. More importantly, the sales from its COVID-19
vaccine are not the only important contributor to the total revenue. So,
the situation with cash flow and earnings seems solid.

### Manufacturing Capacity

Pfizer’s vaccine is limited by the manufacturing capacity of the company
and its partner, BioNTech SE. The company stated that it would scale up
production in response to strong demand and increased revenue for the
quarter. BioNTech added new manufacturing lines at the Lonza facility,
located in Visp, Switzerland, and greenlighted other changes to the
manufacturing processes.

### Pfizer Index Inclusion

There is a phenomenon called the index inclusion effect. It implies that
after being included in a stock index, the increased demand for the
stock from index [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s may increase its value. So, if other indices
like the ones we mentioned earlier add the company to the list, it will
be reflected in the Pfizer share price prediction. ****

## Pfizer Price in 2021: Forecasts From Experts

Below are five projections on the Pfizer stock future from prominent
analysts and firms.

### Geoffrey Porges, SVB Leerink

 ****

[Geoffrey Porges][2] recently shared his Pfizer stock price forecast for
2021, where he maintained his “Hold” rating and lowered his price target
from $44 to $40. This was a reaction to the [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) that the experimental
pain medication developed by Pfizer and Eli Lilly may be less likely to
gain approval.

### Elmar Kraus, DZ Bank

[Elmar Kraus][3] sees growth potential as he raised his rating from
“Buy” to “Strong Buy,” setting the PFE price target at $41. This is a
projected 6.30% upside from the current price at the time of writing.

### Vamil Divan, Mizuho

The PFE stock forecast from [Vamil Divan][4] has both good and bad price
projections. On the one hand, he maintains his “Strong Buy” rating, and
on the other hand, he lowered the price target from $44 to $42.

### The Goldman Sachs Group

[Pfizer][1] has been assigned a $41.00 price objective by stock analysts
at The Goldman Sachs Group. And the firm currently doesn’t see much
growth, having a “Neutral” rating on the biopharmaceutical company’s
stock.

### Berenberg Bank

The mention in our analyst recommendations is Berenberg Bank. They
reiterated a “Neutral” rating while also issuing a $38.00 price target
on shares of Pfizer in their research note.

bullish trend. Based on the technicals, as well as the fact that Pfizer
is scaling up manufacturing and increasing sales, the long-term price
target can be set at 55 USD.

up? [Gov Capital][5] shared their Pfizer stock price forecast for 2022.
According to this source, the stock will lay low at the beginning of
next year and make a big leap in mid-spring. ****

The drastic surge in PFE stocks’ value in the spring may be caused by
the company’s increased capacity ([3 billion doses of the vaccine][6])
and authorization for vaccination of younger kids ([6 months to 11
years][7]).

## Pfizer Price Forecast for 2023

[Gov Capital’s][5] PFE forecast for 2023 is full of surprises — future
prices might be falling in the first few months and an explosive
increase (possibly caused by an expected spike in sales).

Again, the source expects a sudden rise in PFE’s value. This may be
explained by the EU buying more doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech in 2023 —
[1.8 billion][8].

## What Will Pfizer Stock Be Worth in 2025-2030?

This Pfizer stock forecast for 2025 is provided by [Digital Coin
Price][9]. Contrasting it to the Gov Capital’s prediction for 2023, the
values provided for 2025 are nothing but a natural progression (as long
as all developments go according to plan).

Kind reminder: Pfizer stock projections for 2030 is only an estimated
assumption. With forecasts so far into the future, accuracy is limited.
Even the Pfizer stock 5-year forecast should be taken with a degree of
skepticism. That’s why conservative [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s may have a preference for
indices like S&P 500 rather than try to pick the stock performance
winners.

## Pfizer’s Stock Price Changes Over Time

Having checked the Pfizer predictions, let’s take a look back to gain
some perspective. Below is the timeline of some of the most notable
events (in recent price [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/)):

  * October 2016: A public health emergency Zika — stock price at $28.

  * 2017: Lackluster financial results — $31-$34.

  * February 2018: Millions paid to resolve co-pay allegations — close to $32.

  * November 2018: Announcement of plans to raise the list prices of 10% of its portfolio — $43

  * July-August 2019: Poor decision to spin off its generic drug business — from $40 to $32. 

  * March 2020: WHO declares COVID-19 a Pandemic — the stock quote fell to $27.

 ****

  * May-June 2020: Safety study of four different COVID-19 vaccine variations — from $36 down to $30 and back to $36.

  * July 2020: Two vaccine candidates winning regulatory approval from the FDA — a rise to $37.5.

  * November: Pfizer and BioNTech announce the vaccine’s success.

  * December of the same year: The FDA issued the first emergency use authorization (EUA) for the vaccine — $42.5.

  * February 2021: Unfulfilled earnings expectations — $33. 

  * March-April 2021: Operation Warp Speed and plans to increase output — $38.

## Is Pfizer a Good Long-Term Investment?

Pfizer doesn’t draw long-term [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s by quick pops and drops but
rather solid stock performance over the years versus months or even
days. Overall, the Pfizer share forecast confirms that the company is a
top pick for those seeking profit from a pharma giant.

This Pfizer stock outlook by [Coin Price Forecast][11] is adamant that
Pfizer’s stock is a good one.
