Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 25.05.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency

All the three cryptocurrency pairs covered in the article should be
forming bullish zigzags in the near future.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

The BTCUSD market has recently completed wave 2, and the price continued
to decline. There could be unfolding the initial part of a new impulse.
The market must have completed the impulse down wave [1], and the price
is rising in the bullish correction [2]. Wave [2] could be a regular
zigzag (A)-(B)-(C), as it is outlined in the chart. This zigzag should
end at a level of 48300.00, where wave [2] will retrace wave [1] by
61.8%.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:



Buy 38219.00, TP 48300.00

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

The XRPUSD market is forming the initial part of a large double zigzag.
Wave (W) is composed of three major sub-waves A-B-C. Impulse A and
correction B have completed. Correction B is a double zigzag. The
descending impulse wave C must have also completed. The market is
rising; the first impulse sub-wave A of the linking wave (X) could have
completed. An approximate trajectory of the Ripple future price movement
is outlined in the chart. The price could soon rise to a level of 1.187.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] today:



Buy 0.971 TP 1.187

## Elliott wave Ethereum analysis

After the upward impulse wave C completed, the market has started moving
down, forming the initial par of the bearish impulse. The first bear
impulse wave 1 seems to have completed as an impulse. Next, the marker
has formed the first sub-wave [A] of the zigzag-shaped correction. There
should be unfolding correction [B] and impulse [C] soon, as it is
outlined in the chart. The Ethereum price could go up to a level of
2991.00, where wave 2 will retrace wave 1 by 50%.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Buy 2539.76, TP 2991.00
