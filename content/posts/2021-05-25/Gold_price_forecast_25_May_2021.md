Gold needs explanation. Forecast as of 25.05.2021Dmitri Demidenko

What will happen to the gold price? Will it grow due to inflation, or
will it fall due to accelerated global economic growth? To answer this
question, you need to understand the situation better. Let us analyze
the gold outlook and make up a trading plan

## Monthly gold fundamental forecast

For decades, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s have been taught that gold is a hedge against
inflationary risks, so it responds to fluctuations in consumer prices.
In fact, gold is reacting to the Fed's statements about inflation. If
the central bank considers it a threat, it is time for the [XAUUSD][1]
bulls to give in, if not, they will continue to dominate the market. In
this regard, the FOMC's dovish stance contributed to the return of the
gold price to the zone of ​​4-month highs.

Most of the problems in financial markets are instigated due to
misunderstandings. A banking corporation, Julius Baer, claims that the
acceleration of global economic growth will reverse the gold uptrend.
Capital Economics, for the same reason, expects the precious metal to
reach $1,600 an ounce at the end of the year. The [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) of the world
GDP acceleration is the story of the weak US dollar, which creates
growth drivers for [XAUUSD][1]. Well, at least UBS calls inflation,
growth of Treasury yields, and a strengthening greenback as the reasons
justifying the $1600 price. This is closer to the truth than
accelerating global economic growth.

Capital inflows into gold-focused [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/)s in May after three months of
outflows, as well as speculative net longs rising to their highest
levels since January, indicate that gold bears are now in the minority.

Since the beginning of the year, the fall of cryptocurrencies' prices
has made the gold move from the red to the green zone. Bitcoin was one
of the most efficient tools for investment throughout 2020 and the first
four months of 2021. It was called an alternative to gold as a hedge
against inflationary risks. However, when Elon Musk spoke about the harm
of Bitcoin to the environment, Chinese officials tightened their [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
towards miners, and central banks began to express disapproval, BTC
began to decline, negatively affecting other assets. As a result,
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are selling Bitcoin-focused [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/)s and returning money to gold
[ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/)s.

In my opinion, the situation with a slower than expected recovery of the
US labor market and accelerating inflation is ideal for gold. It makes
the Fed think that the recovery of the US economy after the pandemic and
recession will be difficult, so it is too early to abandon monetary
stimulus. This fact puts pressure on both bond yields and the US dollar,
encouraging the [XAUUSD][1] bulls. Ultimately, traders must understand
that gold prices do not depend on inflation, but on what the Fed's
officials think about inflation.

### Monthly gold trading plan

A falling greenback price and stabilized Treasury yields create the
preconditions for further growth of [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/) holdings and speculative net
longs. The update of the May high is likely to contribute to the
continuation of the gold rally in the direction of the [previously][2]
indicated targets of $1905 and $1955. I recommend holding and adding up
to long positions on the corrections.
