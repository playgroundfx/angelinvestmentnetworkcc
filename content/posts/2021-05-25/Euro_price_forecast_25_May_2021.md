Euro believes in itself. Forecast as of 25.05.2021Dmitri Demidenko

The Fed’s unwillingness to make any adjustments to monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) due
to the temporary nature of the surge in inflation in the US encourages
the [EURUSD][1] bulls to go ahead. Let us discuss the Forex outlook and
make up a trading plan.

## Monthly euro fundamental forecast

Trust but verify. If markets believe in the Fed's words about the short-
term nature of excessively high inflation, stock indexes rise, while
Treasury yields and the US dollar fall, as a temporary surge in consumer
prices should not induce the central bank to withdraw monetary stimulus.
And vice versa, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s' doubts result in the tests of the Fed’s
determination in the form of sell-offs of stocks and bonds, which allows
the greenback to strengthen. At the end of May, financial markets want
to trust Jerome Powell and his colleagues.

The [EURUSD][1] bulls draw the price back above figure 22 base amid
dovish comments of FOMC officials. Governor Lael Brainard, Atlanta Fed
President Raphael Bostic, and St. Louis’s James Bullard said they would
not surprised to see the inflation spike in coming months as the
pandemic recedes, but much of those PCE gains should prove to be
temporary.

Such a trend of US inflation, coupled with research by the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York, according to which the Federal Reserve balance
may grow from the current $7.9 trillion to $9 trillion in 2023,
encourage [EURUSD][1] bulls to go ahead. Even if the Fed finishes QE,
its assets will continue to grow through reinvestment of funds received
at bond redemption. The central bank is not going to leave the bond
market, which presses down the Treasury yields, contributing to the fall
in the USD index.

I should note that the euro has its own growth drivers. For example, the
euro-area securities become more popular. Since the beginning of the
year, [EuroStoxx 50][2] has grown by 13%, surpassing the result of the
[S&P 500][3], which has not happened since 2017. In 2017, the euro was
14% up versus the US dollar.

### Dynamics of stock indexes

The primary drivers of the European stock indexes rally this year are a
large number of undervalued European companies, whose revenues will grow
in response to the victory over the pandemic; fewer fears about
inflation surge in the euro area than in the United States; maintaining
of the ECB's ultra-easy monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/); accelerated vaccination;
positive forecasts for the euro and, finally, expectations that the
euro-area GDP will exceed the forecasts. The growing appeal of the euro-
area assets results in the capital inflow to the European financial
market, which supports the [EURUSD][1] bulls.

### Monthly [EURUSD][1] trading plan

Of course, the Forex situation could change at any moment. However, as
long as [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s believe the Fed and the euro has its growth drivers,
the [EURUSD][1] uptrend is likely to continue. If the price breaks
through May’s highs, the euro should continue the rally towards $1.23
and $1.24, so one could add up to the longs entered earlier.
