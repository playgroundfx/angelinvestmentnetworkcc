Litecoin Price Predictions: How It could go in 2021 and BeyondJana Kane

Litecoin cryptocurrency was up by more than 140% in 2020, despite a
recent drawdown that reduced the asset to about $50 per LTC. The
Litecoin price has been through a lot from its launch – going up and
down. Its price started at about $3 per LTC and has gone through a
number of bubble cycles or "alt seasons."

These contributed to a significant rise in the price before a minor
correction occurred. These price corrections do nothing to counter
Litecoin's strong price trajectory. As for the long-term Litecoin
prediction, the outlook suggests that Litecoin's potential is extremely
high. Eventually, Litecoin closed 2020 at $126.23 (on Coinmarketcap).
Will the price of Litecoin go up this year and in the years to come?
Let's find out!

The article covers the following subjects:

## A Bit of Litecoin History

Litecoin ([LTC][1]) is a so-called digital peer-to-peer currency
integrated into open-source software. Technically, the Litecoin project
is very similar to the Bitcoin system. Litecoin production and
transmission are based on an open-source encryption protocol. There is
no central control. With this in mind, all transactions, balances, and
expenses are managed by a peer-to-peer network. Litecoin is created on
the basis of a cryptological hash function, which in turn generates
blocks. Litecoin can be exchanged for Bitcoin and fiat money. The
processing in question usually takes place via online exchanges
([cryptocurrency exchange](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/best-cryptocurrency-exchange/)s).

Litecoin was created by a former Google employee, Charlie Lee, in 2011.
The cryptocurrency was created based on the Bitcoin protocol but differs
in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of the hash algorithm used. Furthermore, it also differs in
hard caps, block transaction times, and some other factors. Litecoin was
released via an open-source client on GitHub on October 7, 2011. On
October 13, 2011, 5 days later, the Litecoin network went live.

Lee's goal was to create a light version of Bitcoin with Litecoin.
Developers have always stated that you can consider Litecoin to be the
silver version of Bitcoin. Litecoin differs from Bitcoin in the
prioritization of the transaction confirmation rate, which is
approximately 2.5 minutes per block. However, the reality is that
Litecoin users will have to wait up to about 30 minutes for their
transaction to be processed due to network congestion.

## Why Is Litecoin an Attractive Investment Asset?

Litecoin is especially faster at handling payments than Bitcoin and is
an excellent, proven complementary alternative. It's a very cheap,
super-safe highway for making payments - especially when it comes to
micro-transactions, like, for example, when paying for a cup of coffee.
In addition, the Litecoin community is working on the implementation of
all kinds of new fintech gadgets that are actually intended for Bitcoin.
Litecoin is now working on the implementation of the lightning network
protocol and applications for [smart contract](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/smart-contract-on-blockchain/)s and privacy (including
confidential transactions & MimbleWimble). Litecoin is certainly light
and cheap, but above all in good hands with fantastic ambitions.
Litecoin has a bright future as a classic and reliable altcoin.

Most [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s see Bitcoin as gold and Litecoin as silver. Litecoin was
developed as an alternative to Bitcoin and developed as a lightweight
that solved some shortcomings of Bitcoin. It is a classic altcoin with
more than 6 years of experience and development behind it. Software
updates and new tech can be easily added to Litecoin.

As with Bitcoin, there is also a built-in scarcity. In total, only 84
million Litecoin can be mined. Litecoin can be considered a much cheaper
and faster alternative. In fact, Litecoin is underestimated relative to
other cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is slower and more expensive to use
compared to Litecoin.

The fact that Litecoin is fast and cheap has advantages, especially
since people in third world countries without bank accounts can still
get Litecoin cheaply and quickly.

### Why is Litecoin going up?

Litecoin is a superior alternative to fiat money when compared to
Ethereum. Ethereum was not developed as money, but it can certainly be
used as such. You could rather consider Ethereum to be crypto gas.

In addition, Ethereum is a much more difficult concept to grasp than
Litecoin. Litecoin is just digital p2p money with a built-in scarcity
that actually works faster as a transaction medium. This makes adoption
much easier and does not require much knowledge. Simply install the
wallet app on your smartphone, and you will have your own Swiss Litecoin
bank account with which you can actually conduct transactions almost
immediately. As the popularity and price of Bitcoin increase and,
therefore, the transaction costs rise, cheaper and faster alternatives
will be sought. This is Litecoin, baby.

## Other Interesting Facts

Litecoin has made a lot of progress and has even been included as a
means of payment in Venezuela's mainstream international payments
system. Via the Remesas remittance platform, foreigners can send
Litecoin to family members and friends in Venezuela who receive Bolivars
in their local bank account through Remesas. A commission of 15% is
charged, which means that the government in Venezuela secretly collects
Litecoin.

Another interesting fact is that the Litecoin Foundation has a 9.9%
share in the German WEG bank. The Litecoin Foundation has received this
as a donation from the Swiss [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) company TokenPay. Together they
have almost a 20% share in this conservative German bank, mainly for
real estate [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s. Litecoin can thus be recognized in the long-term
as a possible cryptocurrency for buying real estate in Germany? But we
digress, so let's not dive too deep into the matter, look at the price
[history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/), and see how the coin develops.

## Litecoin Price Analysis

Despite it not being a bullish period for cryptocurrencies until around
October 2020, Litecoin has performed reasonably well compared to its
competitors. Charlie Lee is clearly doing really well; he finally
introduced confidential transactions (CT). Like the privacy coins ZCash
and Monero, LTC’s confidential transactions will prevent replaceability,
scalability, and privacy issues.

The acceptance rate is also quite high. Very recently, the Litecoin logo
was even advertised on the UFC mat during a famous fight. It was a real
eye-catcher. Furthermore, a new shopping center in Singapore with an ATM
that accepts both Bitcoin and Litecoin has been installed. LTC price
prediction is very optimistic in the opinion of experts.

Experts expect the Litecoin future to be bright in 2021 due to all
integrations and partnerships. In addition, the Litecoin community is
very active, with all the upcoming developments. They will, of course,
keep the enthusiasts informed. There is a clear potential that Litecoin
will rise further and is certainly a tough competitor for the other
cryptos.

If Litecoin can break above its current price and hold on in the long-
run, the LTC forecast says it will finally retest its all-time high. The
maximum height for the Litecoin /US dollar rate is likely to remain
below $300 for much of the next year. What will Litecoin do in the next
5 years?



## Litecoin Price Predictions for 2021 by Crypto Experts

The cryptocurrency market is very volatile, which means that predicting
reliable prices of cryptocurrencies is indeed one of the most difficult
things to do. Let’s have a look at some recent expert publications
regarding their statement and LTC prediction and its market price. They
may give us food for thought about Litecoin coin review:

TradingBeasts predicts a downward correction from June. The average
price won't hit $300. Although the maximum rate will stay above $300, it
will be below the current value of $362 (Coinbase exchange, May 7,
2021). The minimum price will fluctuate near $240.

Wallet Investor always has been frank and conservative in predicting all
cryptocurrencies. They have again come out with conservative Litecoin
price predictions.

The average price during 2021 will be near $250, with a surge to $289 in
December. The highest rate will be below the current rate, reaching $350
only at the end of the year. Since June, the minimum price will fall
below $200. Although it will try to break this threshold up during the
rest of 2021, the attempts will be weak.

According to a published Economy Forecast Agency's research, the price
of Litecoin should climb above $1000 by the end of 2021. The study
states that Litecoin is good for investment in the long run. Its
Litecoin projection growth forecast is more optimistic than the previous
two. It might be overestimating how much power Litecoin has.

Coin Price Forecast platform has the rosiest outlook on the LTC/USD
rate. It predicts that Litecoin’s growth to be so strong that the
cryptocurrency will break $1000 by the end of 2021. In the middle of the
year, the price will be already at $651. We can say that it's an overly
optimistic projected growth. Still, no one can know what will happen
tomorrow. Maybe the Economy Forecast Agency and Coin Price Forecast
[website](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/website-for-forex-trading/)s' analysis will make sense.

## Litecoin Technical Analysis

To provide a realistic Litecoin future price forecast, I will start the
LTC technical analysis with the study of the [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) data of the[
LTC/USD][2] rate movements in the long term. Let us analyze the monthly
timeframe.

Let us define the global trend first. Litecoin, like the rest of the
cryptocurrency market, has been developing the bullish trend since March
2020.

There is the monthly chart of the Litecoin to US dollar price. Blue dots
mark the most significant trade volume in 2019–2020.

The earliest surge in the trader activity, which occurred in May 2019,
corresponds to the extended green candlestick. Its high forms a strong
resistance level at $146, marked with the green line. In December 2020,
the market price didn’t break it out.

In January, the Litecoin price was testing the level and broke it out
upside. In February, the LTC coin consolidated above. According to the
LTC/USD analysis, level 146 USD is a strong support zone currently.

### LTC price prediction for next three months

I should also take into account [Bollinger Bands](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/bollinger-bands.html) to perform a profound
LTC/USD analysis.

The local high in January 2021 is much higher than the upper band; next,
the price bounced off. A similar situation occurred in 2019, during the
previous growth wave. This is a typical signal that the coin is
overbought. Over the three weeks, the signal has appeared once again,
and Litecoin has already started a corrective price movement, which
could continue in the short-term outlook.

To present an LTC prediction for the next three months, let us analyze
the LTCUSD price fractals in the Litecoin trend [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/). The above chart
displays similar bullish fractals with three peaks. After the upward
price movement finished, a deep correction started, according to the
price [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/).

I have conventionally divided this market movement into three stages:

  * Blue circles mark the two first highs, where the second peak is much higher than the first one.

  * Green circles mark the final wave of the uptrend.

  * Red circles mark a smooth correction composed of seven waves.

The final wave of the green circle seems to have completed. It is clear
from the Fibonacci grid applied to the third wave.

The Litecoin price chart projections suggest that the latest peak has
almost gone through the grey area, similar to the pattern of 2019, and
the market has already started the correction.

Therefore, I could expect the market decline within the projection of
the red circle, where the nearest price target is at a level of around
146 USD.

### Monthly Litecoin price forecast for 2021

Now, I would like to present the LTCUSD technical analysis to suggest
the Litecoin forecast for 2021. I will use the study of the price
fractals in 2018 and 2019, trendline analysis, and [Bollinger Bands](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/bollinger-bands.html).

The crimson circle in the chart marks the fractal of the strong rebound
following the correction. Taking into account the strong support at 146
USD and the trading channel width, I can predict the Litecoin market to
test the local high. After that, the correction is likely to continue.

The next strong support zone, [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/)ly confirmed in 2017, 2018 and
2020, is between 80 and 100 dollars. The market is likely to retest
these levels in 2021.

Based on the [Bollinger Bands](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/bollinger-bands.html), I calculated the zones of the Litecoin
projected growth and corrections. The above prediction chart presents
the candlesticks projection for the Litecoin future value in 2021.

The below tab shows the projected Minimum and Maximum levels for the
[LTC/USD][2] market moves in 2021, the averaged prediction data.

The [LTCUSD][2] price technical analysis is presented by [Mikhail
Hypov][3].

[Here, you can find [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) Litecoin short-term forecasts][4] and trading
signals based on the Elliott wave analysis.

## Weekly Elliott wave Litecoin analysis as of 31.05.2021

On the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) timeframe, the crypto-pair LTCUSD is forming a simple
zigzag A-B-C, with bullish wave C completed as part of it lately. That
wave developed as an impulse consisting of five sub-waves
[1]-[2]-[3]-[4]-[5]. So, the market is building the first part of a new
bearish trend. It will most likely develop as a simple zigzag
[A]-[B]-[C]. Let's have a detailed look at the last segment of the H8
timeframe.

We see the market moving in a downward direction. It might have started
to form a zigzag consisting of sub-waves [A]-[B]-[C]. Impulse wave [A]
must have finished forming. A bullish corrective wave [B], which may
form as a simple zigzag (A)-(B)-(C), is unfolding at the moment. The
first two parts of that correction probably have already been completed,
and impulse (C) has just started developing. So, we may prepare for a
price rise in wave (C) to 265.00. Correction [B] will be 50% of impulse
[A] at that level.

### Weekly [LTCUSD][2] trading plan structure:

Buy 173.83, TP 265.00

## Litecoin Price Prediction for 2022

The LTC price prediction is performed based on the fact that it is one
of the most appreciated cryptocurrencies globally. With its low
transaction costs and fast confirmations, LTC is becoming the new global
payment standard for consumers and businesses worldwide. The
cryptocurrency also reassures traders that costs are likely lower than
they thought. The processing fees are far less than those incurred by
credit cards and other forms of payments. Even the integration is free.

As Litecoin is steadily gaining more popularity, the acceptance ratio
might also increase. It is already high compared to the other newcomers.
Let's have a look at the predictions of crypto experts.

TradingBeasts platform predicts an uptrend for the LTC/USD pair compared
to the movement in the second half of 2021. The average price is
anticipated to climb above $300 in February. Since then, it will keep
rising. The maximum value can break above $400 in the second half of the
year. The lowest rate will hold below $300.

The [website](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/website-for-forex-trading/) is highly pessimistic about the Litecoin price in 2022. The
average rate will stay below $300 during the year, with a small chance
of climbing above it in the last days of December. The maximum price
will fluctuate near $350 in the first half of 2022. After, the downtrend
will start. Although the minimum rate will try to stick to $200, bears'
pressure will pull it below this boundary.

Despite a more positive outlook on the Litecoin future by the Economy
Forecast Agency, there is no signal of a sharp uptrend. The price will
be highly volatile and won't set new highs.

Coin Price Forecast sticks to its optimistic projections. The price of
LTC will continue rising in 2022. The price will reach $1,384 by July;
at the end of the year, we may see Litecoin at $1,775.

## Litecoin Price Prediction for 2023

Litecoin price forecasts vary a lot. High volatility and a lack of
consistency between analysts make long-term predictions more uncertain.
Still, we can't avoid price predictions for 2023 as they may help long-
term [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s.

TradingBeasts believes Litecoin can keep rising in 2023. The average
price will be able to break above the $400 level. Although it's not a
significant increase compared to the current rate, the overall uptrend
is a good sign for Litecoin [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s. The maximum price will overcome
the $500 level in October.

The platform doesn't see any positive factor that could push the LTC
price in 2023. The downtrend will continue, and the average price will
stay below $300. Even in times of significant spikes, the maximum rate
won't hit $400. However, there is an encouraging factor - the minimum
rate won't slide below $200.

Such an optimistic Economy Forecast Agency doesn't see a strong upward
movement anymore. The downtrend will prevail, and the price may end 2023
year at $732.

What can change Coin Price Forecast's opinion about a bright LTC future?
We think nothing can do that. The [website](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/website-for-forex-trading/) believes the cryptocurrency
will skyrocket to $2,217 at the end of 2023. In the middle of the year,
it will move near $1,866.

## Long-Term Litecoin Price Prediction: 2025-2030

The third halving for Litecoin is set to take place in May 2023. In
doing so, block rewards would be halved to 6.25 LTC. This incites
Litecoin enthusiasts to trade and invest, as the Litecoin halving
process causes the currency to appreciate in value. Litecoin could even
excel above its competitors to become one of the most traded
cryptocurrencies. As of now, the rewards per block are [12.5 coins][6]
and will decrease to 6.25 coins per block post halving.

What could Litecoin be worth in 10 years? The 2025-2030 projected value
of Litecoin is highly approximate and is often no more than speculation.
Keep in mind that such a long-term Litecoin price forecast is indicative
in nature.

Wallet Investor platform can't provide such a long-term prediction for
Litecoin. Still, it has forecasts for 2025 and 2026. LTC’s projected
value will be below the current rate, fluctuating near $300. Even the
maximum price won't gain momentum to hit $400. The minimum rate will
stay above $200. As a result, LTC will mostly move sideways.

The Agency has a forecast for the first half of 2025. In 2025, Litecoin
has more chances to set new highs. The LTC/USD pair will be near $1,000
by July 2025.

would recommend that you follow Litecoin [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) and network updates that
could affect the LTC price.

## How Has the Price of Litecoin Changed Over Time?

The Litecoin price today is $183.30. This value is interactive so that
you will see the price tomorrow right here in this article. On the
current CoinMarketCap [ranking](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/crypto-exchange-ranking/)s, Litecoin ranks #10, with a market cap of

important not just to look ahead but also to look back at the [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/)
price performance of Litecoin. The current Litecoin price is quite
promising. Below you'll see how Litecoin performed over the years of its
existence:



## Is Litecoin a Good Investment?

Litecoin, buy or sell? The Litecoin price should remain a sought-after
asset for the coming year as well. In the past three months alone, the
currency is up 120 percent. Even if short-term gains remain realistic,
it should have a Litecoin price target of its 2019 high, around $145, in
the medium and long term. Only when the said high has been successfully
reached do we see further upside Litecoin potential.

The coronavirus pandemic is likely to remain at the heart of the markets
in 2021. In response to the massive support of central bankers from the
world's major central banks, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are increasingly looking for a
hedge to counter value risk. Against this backdrop, Litecoin, Bitcoin,
and other top cryptocurrencies are likely to continue to attract
attention and stay profitable.

If Litecoin can break above its current price and hold on in the long-
run, the Litecoin forecast says it will finally retest its all-time
high. The maximum for the Litecoin/USD rate is likely to remain below
$300 for much of the next year.

Below is a prediction chart for 2021. One feasible LTC chart, based on
