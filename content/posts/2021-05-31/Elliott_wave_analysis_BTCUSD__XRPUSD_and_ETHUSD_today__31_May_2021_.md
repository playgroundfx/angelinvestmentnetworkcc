Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 31.05.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

Most likely, cryptocurrency pairs began to build bullish waves, which
can take the form of impulses. Let's consider the situation for each
pair separately.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

It is expected that Bitcoin has begun to build the initial part of the
bear impulse, which will consist of sub-waves [1] - [2] - [3] - [4] -
[5]. It seems that the first sub-wave [1] in the form of an impulse has
already come to an end. Then the formation of a corrective wave [2] as
an upward simple zigzag (A) - (B) - (C) began. The middle part of this
zigzag, that is, wave (B), seems to have taken the form of a double
zigzag W-X-Y. Shortly, the price may rise within the bullish impulse (C)
to the level of 44500.00. At this level, wave [2] will reach the
Fibonacci level of 50% of wave [1].

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 35406.00, TP 44500.00

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

Most likely, at the XRPUSD market, the down wave (W) was completed,
which took the form of a simple A-B-C zigzag. There should be unfolding
the ending part of the zigzag wave of the linking (X), since its first
two sub-waves A and B look complete. Thus, if the assumption is correct,
then in the near future the price may move in an upward direction within
an impulse wave C to the level of 1.153, where wave (X) will reach the
Fibonacci level of 38.2% of wave (W).

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] today:

Buy 0.922 TP 1.153

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

A similar situation is developing in the ETHUSD market concerning
Bitcoin. Now the initial part of the bear impulse is unfolding, as part
of which the first part, which is sub-wave 1, was completed. This wave
has taken an impulse form. Most likely, a bullish correction [2] is
currently unfolding, which is taking the form of a simple zigzag [A] -
[B] - [C]. It seems that the market has completed the formation of a
double zigzag [B], so expect an impulsive rise in wave [C] in the
direction of the level of 3340.00. At this level, wave 2 will be 61.8%
of wave 1.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Buy 2341.16, TP 3340.00
