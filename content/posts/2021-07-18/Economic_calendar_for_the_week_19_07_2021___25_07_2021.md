Economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the week 19.07.2021 – 25.07.2021Jana Kane

##  **Review of the main events of the Forex economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the
next trading week (19.07.2021 – 25.07.2021)**

 **Trading on key Forex [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/): next week we expect the publication of
important macro statistics from Germany, Australia, the US, Eurozone,
the UK, Canada, as well as the results of the meetings of the central
banks of China and the Eurozone on monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) issues.**

The dollar continues to strengthen little by little despite the efforts
of the head of the Fed Jerome Powell. Speaking in Congress Wednesday and
Thursday, he said the central bank will not rush to cut monthly asset
purchases and that the economy is "still far" from the Fed's targets.
Nevertheless, Powell acknowledged that inflation is growing faster than
expected, and if it goes beyond the acceptable limits, monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
will have to be tightened ahead of schedule.

He said that the recent rise in consumer prices has pushed inflation out
of the short-term target zone “slightly” above 2%, and this is “a shock
to the system ...”. “Of course we are not happy with this,” Powell said,
noting that Fed officials are closely monitoring inflation expectations
to see if they need to reconsider their position.

Worries about how long inflation will last, how it will affect future
earnings and the stock market, given the growing likelihood that the
Federal Reserve may begin phasing out stimulus policies ahead of
schedule, and worries about the spread of the coronavirus worsen
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) sentiment and support the US dollar. The DXY dollar index
closed last week with a gain of +0.57%, and the potential for its
further growth remains. It is increasingly difficult for Fed leaders to
contain the strengthening of the dollar against the backdrop of rising
inflation, which has shown record growth rates over the past 29 years.
Sooner or later, they will have to start curtailing the stimulating
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).

Next week, financial market participants will pay attention to the
publication of important macro statistics from Germany, Australia, the
US, the Eurozone, the UK, Canada, as well as the results of the meetings
of the central banks of China and the Eurozone on monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
issues.

 ***during the coming week, new events may be added to the [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) and
/ or some scheduled events may be canceled**

 ****GMT time**

###  **Monday, July 1** **9**

No important macro statistics planned to be released.

###  **Tuesday, July 20**

###  **01:30 CNY The People's Bank of China interest rate decision**

Since May 2012, the People's Bank of China has been steadily cutting
interest rates in support of Chinese manufacturers. The last time the
bank lowered the rate in April 2020 (by 0.20% to 3.85% at the moment).

In 2020, in the context of international trade conflicts and a slowdown
in the global economy, the world's largest central banks took the path
of easing their monetary policies in order to support national economies
and increase the competitiveness of goods exported from these countries.

The People's Bank of China is also in line with this process. The
depreciation of the yuan has become especially relevant in the last 2
years, when the confrontation between the two most powerful economies in
the world began. One of the measures to mitigate the negative
consequences of increased duties on the import of Chinese goods into the
United States was the depreciation of the national currency of China.
This measure was intended, among other things, to maintain the same
volumes of imports of Chinese products to the United States, which would
cost American buyers less due to the difference in the rates of the
national currencies of the United States and China.

The coronavirus has become an additional strong negative factor.

At this meeting, the People's Bank of China will probably keep the
interest rate at the same level of 3.85%, although a rate cut is also
possible.

Nevertheless, if the People's Bank of China makes unexpected statements
or decisions, volatility may increase in the entire financial market.
Investors will also be interested in the bank's assessment of the
consequences of the coronavirus for the Chinese economy and its [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
in the near future in this regard.

###  **01:30 AUD Minutes of the July meeting of the RB of Australia**

This document is published two weeks after the meeting and the decision
on the interest rate. If the RBA positively assesses the state of the
labor market in the country, the rate of GDP growth, and also shows a
hawkish attitude towards the inflation forecast in the economy, the
markets regard this as a higher probability of a rate hike at the next
meeting, which is a positive factor for the AUD. The bank's soft
rhetoric regarding above all inflation puts pressure on the AUD.

Market participants believe that the RBA will not raise interest rates
until 2024, as promised by central bank officials. Wages continue to
rise slowly, and household debt has risen to an all-time high, which
also puts higher interest rates in the longer term.

"The economic recovery will be uneven and unstable," and "unemployment
may remain high for a long time," said the leaders of the RBA after one
of the last meetings of the bank, promising that "the rate will not rise
until the Central Bank sees progress in moving towards full employment
and stable inflation rates in the 2-3% range”.

According to the head of the RBA Philip Lowe, "there are no serious
arguments in favor of tightening monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) in the short term." In
his opinion, "some time will pass before interest rates are raised."

Nevertheless, if the published minutes contain unexpected information
regarding the issues of the RBA's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), the volatility in the
AUD quotes will increase.

###  **08:00 EUR Eurozone Bank Lending Study**

The study conducted by EU financial experts on the state of the bank
lending system is carried out 4 times a year. The main goal of the study
is to obtain expanded information on the conditions of bank lending in
the Eurozone.

The obtained data are used by the ECB management when making decisions
on the bank's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). This report may cause increased
volatility in the euro quotes and on the European stock market at the
time of its publication, if it contains unexpected conclusions regarding
the [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of lending to businesses and households in the Eurozone.

###  **23:50 JPY Bank of Japan Monetary Policy Committee meeting**

At this meeting, the Bank of Japan's Monetary Policy Committee will once
again summarize the results of last week's meeting of the Bank, analyze
the economic situation in Japan and give indications on possible future
prospects for the Bank of Japan's financial [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).

If the tone of the minutes of the meeting indicates the firmness of the
intentions of the Bank of Japan regarding monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) in the
country, it will negatively affect the Japanese stock market and
strengthen the yen. Conversely, a soft rhetoric about the bank's
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) prospects will contribute to the weakening of the yen
and the growth of the Japanese stock market.

###  **Wednesday, July 21**

###  **01:30 AUD Retail Sales Index**

The Retail Sales Index is published monthly by the Australian Bureau of
Statistics and measures total retail sales. The index is often
considered an indicator of consumer confidence and reflects the health
of the retail sector in the near term. A rise in the index is usually
positive for the AUD; a decrease in the indicator will negatively affect
the AUD. The previous value of the index (for May) was +0.4%. If the
data turns out to be weaker than the previous value, the AUD may sharply
decline in the short term, however if it's above the previous values,
the AUD is likely to strengthen.

###  **Thursday, July 22**

Japan celebrates Marine Day. The banks in this country will be closed,
due to which the trading volumes during the Asian session will be
reduced.

###  **11:45 EUR ECB's decision on rates**

The ECB will publish its decision on the key rate and on the deposit
rate. The ECB's tough stance on inflation and key interest rates
contributes to the strengthening of the euro, while a soft stance and
rate cuts weaken the euro. In September 2019, the European Central Bank
lowered its key interest rate on deposits by 0.1%, to -0.5%, for the
first time since March 2016, and began buying bonds worth 20 billion
euros a month, renewing the so-called quantitative easing program.
According to the ECB leaders, the balance of risks for the economic
prospects of the Eurozone "is still shifted to the negative side", and
"until inflation is in line" with the target level, which is just below
2%, the rate will remain low. The new forecasts of the ECB on rates and
the QE program can be viewed as a signal of the inclination to further
soften [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) amid the reluctant inflation to accelerate.

After Brexit, trade conflicts, factors of political instability in
Europe, as well as the growing coronavirus pandemic, due to which
European countries are forced to introduce new quarantine restrictions
that negatively affect economic activity, are the main threats to the
European economy. Back in March 2020, the ECB signaled the possibility
of [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) easing, and the bank's representative admitted that the bank's
management could lower the already negative interest rates even more.

Probably, following the results of this ECB meeting, the key interest
rate will remain at the same level of 0%. The ECB's rate on deposits for
commercial banks is also likely to remain at -0.5%. At the same time,
there is a possibility that at this meeting the ECB will announce a new
program to stimulate the economy, which will put pressure on the euro.

###  **12:30 EUR Press conference of the ECB**

The press conference will be of primary interest to market participants.
During its course, a surge in volatility is possible not only in the
euro quotes, but also in the entire financial market, if the ECB leaders
make unexpected statements. The ECB leaders will assess the current
economic situation in the Eurozone and comment on the ECB's rate
decision. In previous years, based on the results of some ECB meetings
and subsequent press conferences, the euro exchange rate changed by 3-5%
in a short time.

A soft tone of the statements will have a negative impact on the euro.
Conversely, a tough tone from ECB officials on central bank monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) will strengthen the euro.

###  **Friday, July 23**

Japan celebrates Health and Sports Day. The banks in this country will
be closed, due to which the trading volumes during the Asian session
will be reduced.
