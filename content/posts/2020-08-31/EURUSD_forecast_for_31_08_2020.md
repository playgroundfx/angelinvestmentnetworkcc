EUR/USD forecast: Dollar is leading the packDmitri Demidenko

## Fundamental US dollar forecast for today

### Central banks are going along the same path; it is difficult for one
of them to get ahead of all the others

The US dollar could be running down for the fourth consecutive month,
which would be the longest drawdown since the summer of 2017. Societe
Generale says the market is at the very beginning of a multi-year
weakening of the greenback from very high levels. The [EUR/USD][1]
should be trading at 1.25 by September 2021. State Street Global
Advisors believes that the USD index has slipped into a bear market and
will be 15%-20% down in the next five years. JP Morgan suggests high
COVID-19 infection rates and the political environment set the dollar
back.

Jerome Powell’s speech at the virtual meeting in Jackson Hole also
spurred the EUR/USD rally. The Fed’s plans to start targeting the
average PCE hit the greenback. If the US central bank is willing to put
up with the high inflation rate in the future, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s won’t believe
in the US dollar as a saving means. It would be strategically expensive
for a global reserve currency. Nevertheless, to speak about high
inflation doesn’t mean to reach it. The Federal Reserve could manage
excessively high prices in the 1970s only at the cost of two recessions.
Besides, online shopping, outsourcing, population aging, and other
factors suppressed inflation even in the period of the rapid GDP
expansion.

There are also questions for the new Fed strategy from mathematics. What
period to take for calculating the average? If it is since 2012, when
the central bank first announced its 2% inflation target, then the PCE
should be 3.2% in the next five years. If the reference point is the
moment when Jerome Powell was appointed as the Fed’s Chair, then the
average PCE will be 2.3%. If the calculation period is the last five
years, then the average inflation target will be 2.5%. The US central
bank may not wait until the inflation reaches the indicated values to
hike the federal funds rate.

Furthermore, central banks tend to follow the same path, like a pack. It
means a central bank is unlikely to pursue a monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), which is
different from other leading central banks. The Fed switched to the
average inflation targeting following a strategic review of monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). The same review will soon appear on Christine Lagarde’s table.
Also, euro-area inflation has long required decisive measures from the
ECB.

rate

If the Fed can say, “We may have been too aggressive last time, we will
wait longer this time.” How will the European Central Bank respond? “We
have waited forever and will wait forever”? Moreover, there is a dispute
among the members of the Governing Council. The Bundesbank has always
opposed monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) easing. The central bank of Austria has raised
the issue of a lower inflation target. The ECB could choose a more
flexible strategy. The European Central Bank can stop acting proactively
and increase the deposit rate after the CPI reaches 2%.

This scenario, compared to the Fed’s current monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), is a
bullish factor for the euro. However, the talks about a change in the
ECB approach to the inflation targeting and the concerns about the
second wave of COVID-19 in Europe can set the [EUR/USD][1] rally back in
the short run. Investors could sell the euro-dollar on the rise to
1.2025 and 1.2065, or if the pair drops below 1.1865.
