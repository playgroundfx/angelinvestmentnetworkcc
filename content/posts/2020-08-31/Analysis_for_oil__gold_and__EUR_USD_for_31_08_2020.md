Analysis for oil, gold and, EUR/USD for 31.08.2020Alex Rodionov

##  **Oil price forecast** **for** **today:** ** **USCrude****
******analysis**

Oil hits fresh local highs while the uptrend is developing. The upside
target for buy trades is Target Zone 6 [49.17 – 48.42]. Hold long
positions opened in the broken-out TZ 5 and open new purchases on the
correction down to the trend key support [37.34 — 36.72].

The shorter timeframe indicates the short-term oil uptrend, whose target
is Gold Zone 5 [45.04 - 44.67].

Strong support zone are Additional Zone [42.00 - 41.84] and Intermediary
Zone [40.44 – 40.13]. I suggest entering oil purchases in these zones
according to the patterns.

It will be relevant to sell oil when the short-term trend turns down. It
will occur if the price breaks out IZ downside, and the US session
closes the oil price below the zone.

##  **Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis**

In the medium-term chart, the gold price is trading in the range of
[1957.9 - 1913.1]. According to margin zones, the gold medium-term trend
is up.

I suggest two trading scenarios:

  1. Buy gold if the price consolidates above level 1962.0. The US session should close the price above this level. If so, it will be relevant to buy on the retest of Target Zone [1957.9 – 1949.2].
  2. Sell gold if the price consolidates below level 1962.0. The US session should close the price below this level. If so, we shall sell on the retest of Target Zone [1922.4 - 1913.1].

![LiteForex: Analysis for oil, gold and, EUR/USD for 31.08.2020][4]

The short-term trend turned up last Friday. The US session closed the
price above Intermediary Zone [1954.0 – 1949.3]. It is relevant to enter
purchases with a target in the upper Target Zone [2005.1 – 1995.8].

Be cautious when opening buy trades, as gold is trading flat in the
medium-term chart.

Appropriate zones to enter buy trades are Additional Zone [1953.4 -
1951.0] and Intermediary Zone [1930.1 — 1925.5].

##  **Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis**

Last week, the EURUSD reached strong resistance Target Zone 4 [1.1914 -
1.1896]. The price stopped right below the zone. The middle-term trend
is up.

The trading scenario this week depends on whether the euro bulls will
break out the resistance or the middle-term uptrend will stop at the
resistance zone.

I suggest monitoring the market situation. If buyers consolidate the
price above TZ4, we shall enter new purchases with the target in TZ 5
[1.2096 — 1.2078].

![LiteForex: Analysis for oil, gold and, EUR/USD for 31.08.2020][7]

The chart with the smaller margin zones indicates that the eurusd short-
term trend turned up. The price broke out Intermediary Zone [1.1854 –
1.1845]. For today, the EURUSD growth target is Target Zone [1.1954 -
1.1936].

Hold up the buy trades entered in Additional Zone [1.1874 – 1.1869] last
Friday.

I suggest entering new purchases according to the patterns in the new
Additional Zone [1.1879 - 1.1874] and Intermediary Zone [1.1829 —
1.1819].

![LiteForex: Analysis for oil, gold and, EUR/USD for 31.08.2020][8]

###  **[EURUSD][9] Trading ideas for today:**

  1. Hold up buy trades entered in Additional Zone [1.1874 - 1.1869]. TakeProfit: Target Zone [1.1954 - 1.1936]. StopLoss: at breakeven.
  2. Buy according to the pattern in Additional Zone [1.1879 - 1.1874] or Intermediary Zone [1.1829 - 1.1819]. TakeProfit: Target Zone [1.1954 - 1.1936]. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

> IZ - Intermediary Zone: responsible for the price momentum reversing

>

> TZ - Target Zone: a zone that is 75% likely to be reached after IZ
breakout.

>

> GZ - Gold Zone: zone in the medium-term momentum.

>

> All zones are calculated based on the average [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) price of the
instrument and margin requirements of the futures.
