The BTCUSD market continues forming the sideways corrective wave (4),
which should complete as a triple three W-X-Y-X-Z. The final wave Z is
about to finish as a simple zigzag [a]-[b]-[c]. Its final leg, impulse
(5) of [c] looks half-complete. Therefore, the price should continue
declining in this impulse to a level of 11000.00. Next, the market
should turn up and start a new uptrend.
