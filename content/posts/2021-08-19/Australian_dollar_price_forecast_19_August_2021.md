Decline of Aussie. Forecast as of 19.08.2021Dmitri Demidenko

The Chinese economy is losing steam, the coronavirus has scared
Australia, and the Fed intends to normalize monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). What could
be worse for AUDUSD bulls? Let us discuss the Forex outlook and make up
a trading plan for [AUDUSD][1] and [AUDJPY][2].

## Quarterly Australian dollar fundamental forecast

Trouble comes in threes. It is hard to imagine a more troubling Forex
currency than the Australian dollar. Lockdowns due to a sharp
deterioration in the epidemiological situation are not its only problem.
The slowdown in the Chinese economy, the fall in commodity prices and
growing interest in the greenback against the background of expectations
of the start of the Fed monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) normalization make the problems
of [AUDUSD][1] bulls unbearable. The pair collapsed to the [previously
indicated target][3] by 0.722 much earlier than expected. The 9-month
bottom is not the limit.

While the Fed officials are speculating when and how much to reduce QE,
the Reserve Bank of Australia is ready to increase monetary stimulus.
According to the minutes of its August meeting, this will happen if the
bad [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) gets very bad. Since then, lockdowns have spread from Sydney to
Canberra and another 2,500 km north, two-thirds of Australia's 25
million population are isolated, and the retail and service sectors are
dormant. As a result, the RBA's forecast of 4% GDP growth in Australia
in 2021 begins to look fantastic. Westpac expects the economy to
contract by 2.6% in the third quarter and then recover by Christmas.

The hope that GDP will quickly recover after taking control of the
COVID-19 situation, including through accelerated vaccinations, has
allowed the Reserve Bank to maintain its QE withdrawing plan in
September. Commonwealth Bank of Australia is less optimistic. According
to the bank, the recovery of the Australian economy by the end of 2021
is very improbable. The road to the uptrend will be quite bumpy, and GDP
growth will be uneven. In such an environment, no one will be surprised
by the increase in the scale of monetary stimulus. Do not be fooled by
the decline in unemployment in July to 4.6%. The calculation was made
before lockdowns. NAB predicts unemployment growth to 5.6% by the end of
the year.

If in the first half of 2021 the [AUDUSD][1] bulls were afloat thanks to
the strong positions of the commodity market, then the rapid drop in
oil, iron ore and other commodities exported by Australia made them
retreat in panic. After China stepped up efforts to reduce emissions in
the steel industry to peak in 2030, iron ore prices have plunged by 26%
over the past month, pulling the Aussies with them.

### Quarterly [AUDUSD][1] and [AUDJPY][2] trading plan

If to add the slowdown in domestic demand in China, frightened by
COVID-19, there are no good prospects for the Australian dollar.
Moreover, the correction of the US stock indices and the associated
deterioration of the global risk appetite can cause another blow to the
[AUDUSD][1] bulls positions and lower the pair price below the
psychologically important level of 0.7. Continue to adhere to the sales
strategy.

The situation around the [AUDJPY][2] pair looks no better. [The other
day][4] I recommended opening AUDJPY short trades in the direction of
77.1. Bad [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) from Australia has exacerbated the downside risks to
75.5, so use corrections to add up to shorts.
