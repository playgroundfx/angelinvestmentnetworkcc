Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 11.03.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

The Ripple market should be developing a bullish impulse over the next
few days. Bitcoin and Ethereum are forming bearish corrective waves,
which should conclude the large zigzags.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

The BTCUSD chart displays the downward double zigzag [W]-[X]-[Y]
currently unfolding. The second sub-wave, the linking wave [X], must
have completed as a simple zigzag (A)-(B)-(C). Therefore, there should
be unfolding the final motive wave [Y] in the next few days. The nearest
target to enter sell trades is level 49220.00, marked by the corrective
sub-wave 4.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Sell 55928.00, TP 49220.00

* * *

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

The XRPUSD market is forming the middle part of the simple zigzag
[A]-[B]-[C]. That is, there is unfolding the corrective wave [B]. The
market must have completed the bearish correction (B) as a double three.
The price should be rising in impulse wave C to a level of 0.520 in the
near future. At the indicated level, the [B] correction will reach the
Fibonacci ratio of 50% of the [A] impulse. This ratio is highly likely
to be reached.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] today:

Buy 0.455, TP 0.520

* * *

## Elliott wave Ethereum analysis

The hourly ETHUSD price chart displays the downward double zigzag
currently unfolding. There have completed the two sub-waves, W and X,
and the final sub-wave Y has just started forming. Therefore, over the
next few days, the ETHUSD price should be declining. The nearest target
for sell trades is level 1660.00, where a small corrective wave (4)
finished.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Sell 1810.52, TP 1660.00
