Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 11.03.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

A trading recommendation for purchasing gold from the previous
analytical article worked out. After the test of the level of 1710 -
1713, the Price Action - Pin bar pattern was formed.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

Oil traders failed to break out the Target Zone [63.32 - 62.87], which
is a strong medium-term support. Now the oil price is trading in the
correction and is approaching the border of the short-term downtrend
[65.57 - 65.35].

The trend border test will make it possible to consider new WTI sales
according to the pattern with the target at the week's low.

Breakout of level 65.57 and the closing of the US trading session higher
will reverse the short-term trend up. In this case, buy oil with the
target at the upper Target Zone [68.06 - 67.61].

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

Sell according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone [65.57 - 65.35].
TakeProfit: 63.14. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

A trading recommendation for purchasing gold from the previous
analytical article worked out. After the test of the level of 1710 -
1713, the Price Action - Pin bar pattern was formed. Then the pattern
was confirmed by a bullish candle. As a result, the price reached the
Intermediary Zone [1731 - 1726].

The short-term gold trend remains down. Now it is better to search for
sales and wait for a signal to open a sell trade. The sales target will
be the support at 1691.

IZ breakout is required for gold purchases. Then the trend will reverse
up, and the target will be the upper Target Zone [1786 - 1776].

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

Sell according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone [1731 - 1726].
TakeProfit: 1691. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

Euro price is testing the border of the short-term downtrend [1.1923 -
1.1915]. So far, the price didn't break out the zone. Consider sales
from the level with the target at Gold Zone 2 [1.1842 - 1.1834].

Buy the euro if the price closes above level 1.1923 at the US session.
The short-term trend will reverse up. The target for purchases will be
the upper Target Zone [1.2011 - 1.1995].

Today at 14:45 (UTC+02:00), the ECB monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) decision will be
published. A press conference will follow at 15:30 (UTC+02:00). These
events can significantly affect the current balance of power between
buyers and sellers.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

Sell according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone [1.1923 - 1.1915].
TakeProfit: Gold Zone 2 [1.1842 - 1.1834]. StopLoss: according to the
pattern rules.
