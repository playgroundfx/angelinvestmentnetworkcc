Euro is being fed. Forecast as of 11.03.2021Dmitri Demidenko

Although the ECB wants to control everything, it can’t affect the euro
trend. The major currency pair is driven by the US securities market and
the euro-area economy’s state. The euro won’t be steadily growing until
the euro-area economy recovers. Let us discuss the Forex outlook and
make up a [EURUSD][1] trading plan.

## Weekly euro fundamental forecast

While [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s anticipate the ECB meeting, the stabilization of the US
Treasury yield allowed the [EURUSD][1] to go up a little. As I expected,
the House's adoption of the $ 1.9 trillion fiscal stimulus plan enabled
some traders to exit Treasury shorts, which pressed down the yield. The
[Dow Jones][2] Index hit a new all-time high, the11th in a row in 2021,
while the [Nasdaq Composite][3] dipped slightly.

The profit from blue chips and losses yielded by tech stocks is a
typical feature of the current year. The situation was opposite in 2020;
the markets were growing on the expectations, which allowed the [Nasdaq
Composite][3] to dominate. Now, it is time to buy the facts. The Wall
Street Journal experts' median gauge suggests that the US GDP will
expand by 5.95% in 2021, which is the best rise since 1983, when the
economy grew by 7.9%.

The main reason why the forecasts were revised up is the adoption of the
$1.9-trillion fiscal stimulus by Congress. Analysts say the stimulus
will accelerate the US inflation to 2.48% by the end of this year and
add 514,000 new jobs on average each quarter during next year. Previous
aid packages boosted the US budget deficit in October-February to
$1trillion, up from $624 billion in the same period a year earlier.

The US needs money and is willing to borrow it. BofA Global Research
estimates that the supply of Treasury bonds with maturities ranging from
2 to 30 years will grow to $ 2.8 trillion in 2021.In 2020 it was $ 1.7
trillion, in $ 2019 - $ 990 billion. Higher yields are needed to lure
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s to the auctions, so the Treasury yield is unlikely to stop at
current levels near 1.5-1.6%. The US yield rally causes turmoil in the
bond markets of other countries, making central banks worry.

The [EURUSD][1] traders expect the ECB to express its worries. At the
ECB meeting on Marc h11, the Governing Council should decide if the bond
yield growth poses a threat to the euro-area economy or reflects the
optimism about a soon economic rebound. A lower weekly pace of new asset
purchases under the pandemic program should not confuse [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s, the
gross purchases of securities are increasing.

Christine Lagarde must be cautious not to shake the markets, as in the
case of the announcement that the central bank should not cover yield
spreads. The tightening of the euro-area financial conditions has not
yet taken place, so I do not think that the ECB's concerns will stop the
short-term euro growth. Its reasons lie outside the euro area.

### Weekly [EURUSD][1] trading plan

Therefore, I believe that it is the US bond market that will define the
[EURUSD][1] trend. The stabilization of the Treasury yields could push
the euro up to $1.199 or even $1.2035. However, without the signals of
the euro-area economic recovery, the euro uptrend won’t resume. Thus, I
recommend betting on the shorts on the price rise.
