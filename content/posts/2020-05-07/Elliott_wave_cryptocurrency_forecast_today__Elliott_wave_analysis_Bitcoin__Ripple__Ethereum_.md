## Elliott wave forecast for BTCUSD, ETHUSD, XRPUSD for today

###  **Elliott wave[BTCUSD][1] analysis**

analysis Bitcoin, Ripple, Ethereum.][2]

The upward corrective B wave may not have completed, so the previous
chart layout is not relevant now. Wave B is yet unfolding as a double
zigzag [w]-[x]-[y]. The final impulse 5 of (c) is now developing within
the (y) zigzag. After the short rise to a level of 9600, this impulse
should complete. After that, the market will turn down and start
declining in a new downtrend.

###  **Elliott wave[XRPUSD][3] analysis**

After the upward triple zigzag [W]-[X]-[Y]-[X]-[Z] completed, the market
has turned down, and the price is now declining. There is likely to be
forming the bear impulse wave, where two small sub-waves [1] and [2]
have completed. Wave [1] is a down impulse, corrective wave [2] is a
double three (w)-(x)-(y). Correction [2] looks complete, so the price
should be declining in the third wave in the next few days.

###  **Elliott wave[ETHUSD][5] analysis**

Like in the previous chart, the ETHUSD market has completed the large
upward triple zigzag [w]-[x]-[y]-[x]-[z], after that, the market has
started moving down. There is now developing an inceptive phase of the
new bear impulse wave, where the first two segments, sub-waves 1 and 2,
have completed, as well as sub-waves [1] and [2] of a lower degree. The
price should be declining in the impulse wave in the next few weeks.
