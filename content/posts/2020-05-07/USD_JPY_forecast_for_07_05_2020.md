Yen will pass the testDmitri Demidenko

## US jobs report will test the willingness of the USD/JPY bears to go
ahead

How to choose the best among the weakest? You should find the least
suffered! The pandemic did much more harm to the US and the EU than to
Japan. So, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s return to the yen. The [EUR/JPY][1] and the
[USD/JPY][2] are falling amid the increased geopolitical tensions and
the consolidation of the US stock indexes following the roller-coaster
in the March-April period. Besides, they need to find some other
currency to replace the greenback, as its long-term outlook seems to be
weak.

To anticipate changes in the currency rates under the current
conditions, the speed of the GDP recovery is more important than the
depth of the recession. On a global scale, the GDP recovery may be set
back by the escalation of the US-China trade war. Donald Trumps can’t
justify new tariffs citing the alleged laboratory origin of COVID-19.
However, the U.S. president will do saying that China fails to meet the
requirements of the phase-one trade deal. The Chinese economy has just
started recovering, so, it can’t increase the volume of imports from the
USA by $77 billion in 2020! According to Bloomberg experts, China’s GDP
will grow bu just 1.8% this year.

In 2019, Japan’s stocks and the yen were quite responsive to the
escalation of the US-China trade war. The TOPIX was 7% down after Donald
Trump announced an increase in tariffs on China’s imports by $200
billion. Later, the stock index reached its eight-month low in August
when the U.S. president announced new tariffs. Lower risk appetite and
exiting risk hedging trades by foreign [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s sent the [USD/JPY][2]
down

An important growth driver for the yen may be the loss of the dollar’s
appeal for [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s. The expansion of the Fed’s balance sheet to $8
trillion $11 trillion and the increase in the issuance of Treasuries
from $1.28 trillion in 2018/2019 to $4.5 trillion in 2019/2020 fiscal
year are bear factors for the greenback in the long-term prospect. The
rates of the U.S. bond market have already increased amid the expansion
of the Treasuries issuance, and the increase in borrowing costs will set
the process of the economic recovery back.

The euro-area GDP growth is also held back. The ruling of the German
constitutional court may limit the ECB bond purchases and increases the
risks of the euro-area fragmentation. Also, the leaders of the euro-area
governments can’t find a compromise on the fiscal stimulus. Therefore,
the Chinese, the US, or the euro-area economies are unlikely to feature
the V-shaped rebound. It is a positive factor for safe-havens. In my
opinion, if the [USD/JPY][2] bears keep the control after the US jobs
report (a poor reading will press down the US stocks and support the
greenback), the downtrend (started via the[ breakout of the support at
106.75-106.8][5]) is likely to continue.
