## Your Forex guide. Everything you wanted to ask but didn’t know where

When someone wants to make money on the Forex market, he or she comes
across some concepts and definitions. At first, all this seems
confusing. Learning new information can be much time- and energy-
consuming.

I want to help you cut the way of trials and errors short. So, I wrote a
brief guide to the Forex trading basics and tricks, which a newbie will
come across at the very beginning. The success of this way mainly
depends on the first step. The most important is to take a step in the
right direction.

So, you have registered a personal profile on the LiteForex [website](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/website-for-forex-trading/),
pressed on many different buttons, and became a virtual millionaire. To
start real trading, you need to choose the type of your real trading
account.

The [Forex broker](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/best-forex-broker-for-beginners/) offers two trading account types. The ECN (Electronic
Communication Network) account is usually recommended for professional
traders. The Classic one is suitable for all [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s.

Both types are real trading accounts forex, which enables you to trade
in the foreign exchange market. There are not so many differences
between them. However, the ECN account allows a trader to use the copy
trading service, which provides extra profits from copying successful
traders’ trading behavior.

Once you select the account type, you need to define the leverage size.
It can be from 1 to 500. Which leverage ratio will suit you depends on
your trading style. So, I do not recommend you to make hasty decisions
and think it over thoroughly.

## What is Forex leverage?

The LiteForex company offers several [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) for the leverage amount,
varying from 1 to 500. However, you need to understand what financial
leverage is before you make your choice. I’ll try to explain it in
simple [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/). Leverage is the funds you borrow from the Forex broker to
increase your potential return.

It is like a bank loan, but you do not need to submit any additional
documents, and it is interest-free. You can choose the leverage ratio,
where 1 (1:1) will mean you do not take any money from the broker. A 500
leverage (1:500) means that your own funds on the account are multiplied
by 500.

 **Example.** I have my own deposit of 1000 USD. If I use a 1:1
leverage, I can operate only with my own money. If I use leverage 1:500,
I can already enter a trade of 500,000 USD!

I want to warn you to be cautious. With great money comes great
responsibility. If you use the maximum leverage, you can lose all your
deposit if the price makes the slightest swing in an unfavorable
direction.

Experienced traders usually have Forex leverage ranging between 1:30 до
1:200, the standard leverage is 1:100. The leverage of 1:100 is so
popular because it is convenient. You can quickly calculate your own
funds needed as a margin to open and maintain a position.

So, you have selected the trading account type and the Forex leverage
size. Now you need to choose the equipment to buy and sell currencies.

In the past, when the technology was not as developed as it is now,
traders made transactions on the phone. In earlier times, they used the
telegraph. But now we have the Internet and various trading terminals,
including mobile versions and the trader personal profile.

## How to choose a trading platform?

There is no accounting for taste. Everything depends on personal
preferences. However, I want to note some features of using trading
terminals.

 **Trading terminal in the trader’s profile** has a standard set of
[options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) allowing open and close trading positions and track the account
state. It has the necessary tools of technical analysis to identify the
price trend direction. It will perfectly suit a beginner trader, but you
should not expect to find any super [functions](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/basic-functions/) in the standard trading
platform. Besides, this terminal’s great benefit is that you can trade
directly in the trader’s profile without setting special apps.

 **Mobile trading terminals based on iOS and Android** will suit active
people who do not always have a desktop at hand. Mobile versions have
all the necessary tools for Forex trading and standard technical
analysis indicators. The main flaw of mobile trading platforms is the
small size of mobile gadgets. Their screens do not allow one to
thoroughly analyze the current market situation, resulting in a wrong
trading decision.

## Trading platforms MT4 and MT5 or online version?

If you are willing to become a successful trader, a desktop trading
platform will suit you. MT4 has everything you need to make money
successfully. Some traders believe it to be a perfect tool for analysis
and trading.

There are many built-in technical indicators for the price chart
analysis. You can test your own [trading strategies](https://www.fintechee.com/forex-trading-strategies/) here.

It has a simple programming language. So, you can create a trading
algorithm or order a professional to write an Expert Advisor for you. A
user-friendly interface in different languages can satisfy the most
fastidious trader.

The MT4 platform is time-tested, simple, and reliable as a Swiss watch.
MT4 is the real choice of professionals.

The MT5 platform got all the best from its "elder brother.” Besides, you
can trade not only in the Forex market but also operate with other
assets, including stocks and futures. The platform has an extended range
of the market analysis periods, called timeframes, and other advantages.

However, the most significant drawback of the MT5 platform is its
limited functionality when using [custom indicator](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/custom-indicator/)s created for the MT4.

I strongly advise [beginners](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-for-beginners/) to try using the [LiteForex browser terminal
version][1], based on MT4. Its interface is simpler, more intuitive, and
user-friendly; it does not require installation and works through a
browser on any device.

Well, you have selected your trading tools and equipment. It is time to
clarify some concepts and definitions used in the Forex trading and
trader community.

A bonus – you can show off your knowledge. The matter is that traders
use their own trading slang. If you do not know it, you just won’t be
able to communicate with other traders.

## Trading [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) and definitions

 **Forex currency quote** is the price one currency expressed in another
currency. It is written as a fraction. For example, the [EUR/USD][2]
means the value of one euro in dollars. The currency quote where the
first currency is any currency, and the US dollar is in the second place
is a direct quote.

In an indirect quotation, the USD is first, which means the US dollar
value is expressed through some other currency. For example,
[USD/JPY][3] is an indirect quote.

There are also cross rates, which are currency pairs that do not include
the US dollar. The most popular cross rates are [EUR/JPY][4] and
[GBP/JPY][5]. However, I do not recommend beginner traders to trade
cross rates before they feel confident dealing with major currency
pairs.

 **What is a lot in trading?** A lot is the size of the trading
position. In the forex market, a standard lot size is 100 000 (a hundred
thousand dollars, euros, pounds).

Imagine that you enter a trade of a standard lot using a 1:100 leverage.
In this case, you must deposit at least 1000 units of the base currency
(it is the first in the currency pair).

The LiteForex trading conditions allow you to enter the fractional lot
size trade, starting from 0.01 lots. If you use a 1:100 leverage, it
will be 1000 currency units. So, you need only ten units of the quote
currency as collateral.

For example, if you enter a [EURUSD][2] trade of 0.01 lots, your trade
will be 1000 euros. You will need 10 euros as collateral. If you enter a
transaction of 0.1 lots on the same currency pair, the trade size will
already be 10,000 euros. So, you will be required a collateral of 100
euros, which isn’t a big sum. But you still should consider it in your
trading plan.

I gave the figures for the trading account whose currency is the euro.
In other cases, these values will be converted into account currency.

 **What are pips in forex?** A pip measures the amount of change in the
exchange rate for a currency pair and is calculated using the last
decimal point.  For example, if the [EUR/USD][2] exchange rate is
1.23456, a pip is 6.

![LiteForex: Forex trading hacks][6]

 **What is swap?** A swap Forex trading is a fee that you pay to keep
your position open overnight. A trader can make any number of
transactions in day trading.

However, If he/she wants to roll the trade over from one trading day to
another, the broker will charge a fee. This fee is called swap.

A swap results from the change in the exchange rate. It occurs when a
trader uses borrowed funds and the currency different from the account
currency.

> Important! You need to remember that a **swap is a bad thing in most
cases.**

 **What is spread in Forex trading?** The spread is the difference
between the bid (sell) price and the ask (buy) price of a currency pair.
It means the difference between the demand and the supply. The spread
size depends on the current market conditions; it can range from zero to
several pips.

The more traders want to buy and sell a currency pair, the narrower is
the spread. There can also be a fixed spread value, set in the currency
pair specification in advance.

 **What are Stop-Loss and Take-Profit?** A stop loss is pending order
set to close a losing position. It works out to limit your loss at a
particular level fixing the value you can afford to lose. I recommend
you to always set your stop.

A take profit is a pending order that closes the position at a specific
level to fix the expected profit when it is reached. To take profit
means to close a position when the expected gain is achieved.

 **Margin call.** Nobody wants to receive a margin call. A margin call
is a notification from the broker that you must add money to the margin
account to meet minimum capital requirements.

It means that a trader has lost all the funds and must either close the
position or top up the account. I hope you will never know in practice
what a margin call is.

Of course, the above [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) are not all the trading concepts you will
come across in Forex. But they will be enough for a start. I wish you
success in trading! Take care of yourself and your money!
