Tesla stock: Fundamental and technical analysisMikhail Hypov

At the beginning of summer I made two reviews of the Tesla stock that
you can check out [here][1] and [here][2]. Actually, those analyses of
the Tesla shares have been by biggest delusion ever. At that time, one
Tesla share cost about 800 USD, and that seemed to be extremely
expensive, based on fundamental analysis and indicators. Only three
months have passed since then, but the stock itself and the market in
general have changed in quality and structure. The previous analysis
became irrelevant. So, in this article we are going to determine a new
development scenario in the multi-time frame, from a few weeks to a few
years.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Fundamental analysis

Even if using the [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) “Fundamental analysis” and “[Tesla][3] stock” in
one sentence has become improper, we can’t fully ignore this stage.
There’s no point in mentioning the company’s multipliers: they haven’t
changed radically in the past three months. Despite the stock price’s
latest correction, economic analysts still believe that Tesla is
overhyped.

Elon Musk’s love for playing with private [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s’ sentiment using his
Twitter and shocking public speeches is quite famous. I wrote about that
in my previous articles. My main mistake was an attempt to assess the
company’s fundamental figures out of touch with the owner himself.  The
latest events around the split cast light on Elon Musk’s plans. Now his
moves don’t look like a charismatic billionaire’s awkward jokes. They
are rather a considered strategy of a clever man. Musk’s genius isn’t
about engineering, it’s about social sciences. He managed to link his
personal brand to the Tesla company. According to Robintrack, Tesla is
the 8th popular company among the Robinhood users.

> Robinhood is the biggest stock exchange for private [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s that
counts more than 10 million users. It is believed that Tesla’s stock
managed to soar during the pandemic and economic crisis because of its
army of fanboy [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s.

![LiteForex: Tesla forecast: Fundamental and technical analysis][4]

The chart above shows that the company’s cost grew 6 times from March to
September. One of the biggest spikes was in the period from 12th August
till 1st September. The stock’s price grew twice in less than one month!
Let me remind you that Tesla’s split was announced exactly on 12th
August.  Accidentally, another event occurred before that announcement.
On 10th August, Robinhood closed access to the information on its users’
portfolio composition.  Obviously, the main goal of the company stock
split was making it more accessible for private [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s. Stock
exchanges normally don’t allow [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s to buy a share’s fraction.
Since [Tesla][3]’s share price exceeded the level of 1,500 USD in
summer, small [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s simply couldn’t afford to buy Tesla.

However, the Apple Company’s 4:1 stock split prompted a solution.

![LiteForex: Tesla forecast: Fundamental and technical analysis][5]

The positive effect of Apple’s and Tesla’s splits on the stock price is
shown in the chart above. Even if Apple’s stock reached the price of 130
USD, which is convenient to small [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s, Tesla’s positive effect was
two times bigger. The Tesla stock grew 84% on the split announcement
before a split itself. Neither the company’s low profitability, nor its
stock overboughtness or high price could prevent the stock from growing.
It indicates a big number of speculators in Tesla, which can be much
bigger than in Apple.

I don’t think Apple and Tesla conspired to split their stocks at almost
the same time. Elon was asked about an eventual split on Twitter already
on 30th June, and he replied it was “worth discussing at annual
shareholders meeting”. The nearest meeting wasn’t scheduled before 22nd
September, though. So, the stock split decision was a total surprise on
12th August.

![LiteForex: Tesla forecast: Fundamental and technical analysis][6]

Most probably, Elon had used Apple as a lightning rod. Having learnt
about its plans, he decided not to miss out on the opportunity to pump
up the stock price further. If he had taken such a decision at any other
moment, he would have been accused of pumping the bubble. However,
Musk’s actions don’t look so suspicious against Apple’s background. He’s
simply following the marker leader. Interestingly, the split date in the
two cases was the same - 31st August.![LiteForex: Tesla forecast:
Fundamental and technical analysis][7]

> Traders’ secret law says, “buy the rumour, sell the [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/)”.

Obviously, the stock price will go down after the split. That was the
main reason for Tesla stock’s fall, and not its not making it into the
S&P 500. The shareholders simply wanted to fix profits by selling out
the stocks, overheated on expectations.

The pool of Tesla biggest shareholders is headed by Elon Musk himself
with a share of more than 18%. Apple’s stock became the most capitalized
one in the US market after the split, but Elon failed to hide behind its
fall. The chart above shows that Apple’s share price started falling on
the same day with a 6-hour delay.

However, the mass media found another reason for the Tesla stock’s
decline. They all started talking about the exclusion from the S&P500.
Objectively, the [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) on Tesla’s possible inclusion in the index wasn’t
spread as much as the [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) on the stock split. Many experts were
sceptical about the inclusion because of the issues related to the
company’s financial reports. Thus, the exclusion wasn’t supposed to
affect the stock price, as those expectations weren’t inflated. So, in
my opinion, Tesla’s stock fell once big players sold their shares and
fixed profits amidst unprecedented growth.

Elon Musk’s idea is heating demand for the company’s stock for as long
as possible using unexpected tweets and bright public shows.

It’s a harvest-time now.  After the split, Tesla’s stock doesn’t look so
expensive, and hamsters will eagerly buy out cheap shares. If Robinhood
hadn’t concealed the information on its clients’ investment interests, a
growing demand for the stock combined with a price fall would be
obvious. Robinhood itself explains its decision to hide this information
with the intention to lower its clients’ speculative sentiment. The
company representatives say they don’t know how Robintrack’s information
will influence the [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s, and they don’t want to expose them to
additional risks. This statement doesn’t sound convincing as there are
many independent analytics providers on the Internet. For example
LiteForex, which publishes expert opinions, like the one you’re reading
now, and provides access to technical analysis and data on the market
sentiment.

![LiteForex: Tesla forecast: Fundamental and technical analysis][8]

There are screenshots from LiteForex’s [analytical blog][9] above. They
show market sentiment and indicators’ recommendations for Tesla. This is
open access information available to anyone without registration.
Actually, every big respectable broker provides its clients with such
analytical data. Robinhood itself provides a simplified version of this
service, which by the way makes the Robin administration’s actions even
more so absurd. Any trader will always find necessary information on the
Internet if he or she needs to make a trading decision. I think the
closure of the transparent analytical resource at Robintrack is nothing
more but an attempt to conceal the situation where whales unload
expensive Tesla shares on unprotected amateur [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s.

![LiteForex: Tesla forecast: Fundamental and technical analysis][10]

The horizontal volume chart confirms that situation on the 15-minute
time frame. There are no panic sales. Large quantities of stocks are
unloaded within a short time (marked with red arrows). The green circle
marks the core participants’ behaviour. They bought out those unloadings
and then sold them step by step. It happened on 1st  and 2nd September.
Then the market started slightly falling, and the panic developed.  The
manipulators’ reaction is classic: now they’re buying out the panic
sale. I marked that with green arrows. The big players are getting ready
to upload new large stock volumes, prevent panics and give hope for a
retracement.

## Conclusion

Tesla’s cap exceeds the aggregate capitalisation of Toyota, Ford and
Renault–Nissan–Mitsubishi. At the same time, Tesla’s production share is
only 0.5%, while the aggregate one of  Toyota, Ford and
Renault–Nissan–Mitsubishi is about 50%. Obviously, Tesla’s stock price
is overvalued due to Elon Musk’s tactics. This man’s genius lies in the
ability of calculating his steps in the long term, and not in his
engineering skills. He understands well that Tesla can’t compare with
the world's giants. The green car wave has already begun, and the Tesla
company rendered great services to its faster development tempo. Still,
in spite of Tesla’s enormous growth, it can’t compete with the whole
world.  Elon Musk found a smart way of skimming the cream off his
position in the market of electric cars: he raised the stock price sky
high. Thus, Musk can use the stock as a bank margin for drawing in money
and make cash fast through direct market sales. Musk’s popularity helps
him to attract the best engineers and programmers into his projects who
are ready to work for less money and for the sake of the beautiful idea.
In the long term, Elon Musk acts wisely, making the most of the
unprofitable company and expanding business against the background of
big and inflexible auto-giants. Musk’s main task was “booking” a place
in the sun for Tesla, and he did that well. The growing competition
among electric car producers, the scientific progress and economic
crisis will do their work, and Tesla will take a back seat. We are
probably observing the price peak that will never be reached again.
Tesla is on the threshold of a big bearish correction. Technical
analysis will help us understand how deep it will be and if the price
will recover.

## Technical analysis

![LiteForex: Tesla forecast: Fundamental and technical analysis][11]

A technically perfect 5-wave structure catches the eye on the weekly
time frame.![LiteForex: Tesla forecast: Fundamental and technical
analysis][12]

In the chart above, there is a beautiful closure of the fifth wave, near
0.618 fibonacci of the third level. The peak touched the level of
0.786.![LiteForex: Tesla forecast: Fundamental and technical
analysis][13]

On a smaller time frame, there aren’t enough confirming signals for the
fifth wave’s structure to be considered as complete. The chart above
shows that:

  1.  MACD isn’t pointing to a bearish divergence (marked with the red line on top of the chart). If it were there, the five-wave impulse’s completion would be confirmed.
  2. A hidden bullish divergence, marked with the red line below the chart, indicates the bullish sentiment’s strength and an eventual pullback.
  3. The high level of volumes doesn’t allow us to suggest the bullish trend’s completion either.

Thus, we can see strong support at the current levels. It points to a
flat correction. This kind of a correction doesn’t often form at the end
of a five-wave impulse. So, most likely, the current wave is just a part
of a big cycle with a long third wave, and not the final element of a
big five-wave cycle.

![LiteForex: Tesla forecast: Fundamental and technical analysis][14]

So presumably, the correction we are observing at the moment is likely
to be the fourth wave that will close up in the form of a triangle. The
chart above displays this price pattern.  We see a strong bullish trend
that has been developing since March 2020. It must support bulls on the
one hand, and attract bears on the other hand. Given the strong support,
we may suppose that the correction may be consolidating up to the end of
November. Since the third wave of that wave pattern is long, the fifth
wave is likely to be the shortest, or at least not to go beyond the
first wave.

So, the fifth wave may start developing after a false trend breakout.
Its ascending movement will be weak. A diagonal triangle or a growing
wedge may form too. These patterns are normally associated with lower
trade volumes and MACD divergences. It will be a good signal about a
fully-featured correction’s start.

## Long-term plan for 2020-2021

If we take the above wave pattern as a basis, it will be hard to say for
sure how the correction will develop after the five-wave impulse,
because we don’t know how the fifth wave will end.  So, considering
Tesla’s exponential business development and the high demand for its
production, I think an optimistic scenario will be appropriate

![LiteForex: Tesla forecast: Fundamental and technical analysis][15]

Following that scenario, we won’t see a deep drawdown: the future fourth
wave’s projection zone will limit a fall. If my presumption is right and
wave 4 will form as a triangle, the current stock price is located in
the lower part of the pattern. So, it’s a perfect time for
buying.![LiteForex: Tesla forecast: Fundamental and technical
analysis][16]

Every wave analyst will tell you not to trade in the fourth wave.
However, if you’ve considered Tesla as a long-term investment tool, the
current level is a good one.

The targets are clear:

  * The profit taking level should be near the historic high of 500 USD.
  * In an opposite scenario, long positions should be closed once the price breaks below the trend line and the bottom of the fourth wave of smaller degree.
  * The Profit/Risk ratio of 1.35 is very low.

As the risks are high, I would recommend this idea only to Musk’s true
fans who are ready to hold unprofitable trades for a few months. The
rest of [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s had better look for more interesting investment
assets.

## Trading plan for September-October 2020

![LiteForex: Tesla forecast: Fundamental and technical analysis][17]

When it comes to the period of 1-2 months, the trading plan is similar
to the previous one, but the targets are more modest:

Enter at the current levels at around 330 - 370 USD.

Long positions’ target: 450 USD.

If you aren’t ready to maintain a loss-making trade for a few weeks,
close the long position when the local low of 329 USD is updated.

The P/R ratio is better here: it is close to 2.

This scenario’s confirming signals are:

  1. Panic sales, which are often followed by retracements. The semitransparent triangle built as Bollinger bands’ projection marks the bullish correction area in the chart above.
  2. Reaching of Pivot S1 level.
  3. Reaching of the third sub-wave’s peak.
  4. Reaching of the upper limit of weekly [Bollinger Bands](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/bollinger-bands.html).

## Trading plan for the nearest weeks

![LiteForex: Tesla forecast: Fundamental and technical analysis][18]

To find an entry point, pay attention to a smaller time frame. It
concerns the trading plans above too. The chart above shows that:

  1. The target for the nearest weeks is near the Pivot indicator's P level at 425 USD.
  2. The stock is in a bearish trend on the H1 time frame. There’s room for correction.
  3. The confirming signal for going long will be the micro-trend’s end and consolidation above the weekly Pivot level S1 at around 380 USD.
  4. If correction continues, average into the position at 300 USD. It is the weekly Pivot S3 level and the strong market activity channel.
  5. MFI and TD ROC oscillators are in the oversold area. It’s a confirming signal of the first corrective wave’s upcoming stop.

## Final conclusion

Tesla’s stock is overbought: it looks overvalued even at the current
level. This factor makes the nearest investment steps even more
uncertain. The trading ideas above are based on my confidence in the
private [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)’s support and Elon Musk’s eventual intention to
maintain the stock price as he’s the most important shareholder.  The
Iron Man’s support is a popular idea, so I believe choosing a soft
correction scenario as the basic one is appropriate. However, we must be
ready for increased volatility and stop orders’ triggering. I don’t
recommend going short. Evaluate your risks wisely and don’t use big
leverage.

In the multi-year term, I think fundamental bearish factors will prevent
the stock from growing. It’s Elon Musk’s personal brand that forms the
price. After the Space X IPO, the Iron Man’s fans will have an
investment choice. Most likely, the private [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s’ money will flow
from the [“poor dog”][19] to the “new star”.
