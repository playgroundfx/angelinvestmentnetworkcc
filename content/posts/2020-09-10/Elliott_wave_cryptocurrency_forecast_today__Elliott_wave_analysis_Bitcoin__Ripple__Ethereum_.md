The BTCUSD market is forming the down double zigzag, with the first
element, wave [W] forming within. Wave [W] is unfolding as a simple
zigzag (A)-(B)-(C). The five-wave impulse (A) and the bullish correction
(B) have completed. Impulse (C) is yet developing. The corrective wave 4
must be developing now, it is composed of the sub-waves [w]-[x]-[y]. It
should complete soon, and the price will continue declining in wave 5,
as it is outlined in the chart.

The XRPUSD market is forming a down impulse wave (A) that is composed of
five sub-waves. The bear impulse wave 1 and the upward correction 2 have
completed. The market is now declining in the impulse wave 3, namely, in
its fourth leg – correction [4]. Wave [4] is developing as a triple
three (w)-(x)-(y)-(x)-(z). The price should rise a little in this
pattern. Next, the price should decline in the impulse wave [5]. An

The ETHUSD market is trading in the downtrend. The impulse wave (A) is
currently forming, it has started after he bullish zigzag A-B-C has
finished. The sub-waves [1]-[2]-[3] have ended, and the upward
correction [4] is currently unfolding as a simple zigzag (a)-(b)-(c).
This zigzag is about to end soon. So, after wave [4] completes, the
price should be running down in wave [5] as it is outlined in the chart.
