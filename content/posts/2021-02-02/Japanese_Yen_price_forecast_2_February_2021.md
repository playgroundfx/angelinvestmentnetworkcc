Yen loses its shine. Forecast as of 02.02.2021Dmitri Demidenko

Against the backdrop of a potential victory over the pandemic, the
opening of the world's leading economies, and the rapid growth of global
GDP, the fate of the Japanese yen looks unpromising. [USDJPY][1] and
[EURJPY][2] bears remain unready to resist. Let's discuss the market
outlook and make up a trading plan.

## Fundamental Japanese Yen forecast for six months

If you want to do something well, do it yourself. For the first time
since 1989, the [Nikkei 225][3] recorded a double-digit profit for the
year (+16% in 2020) against the background of the outflow of foreign
capital from the Japanese equity market. This helped to dispel the myth
that the stock index cannot grow without the participation of non-
residents. In 2008, it collapsed by 42%, in 2018 by 12% due to foreign
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s' flight from Japan. It's time for local companies to get down
to business. Their activity, pushing [Nikkei 225][3] upwards, is one of
the factors that weaken the yen.

The rise in stock indexes in Japan contrasts with the difficult
situation in which the population and the economy found themselves. The
government is likely to extend the deadline for the lockdown liftings
from February 7 to March 7, which the Dai-Ichi Life Research Institute
estimates will cost GDP about ¥3 trillion. Bloomberg experts' consensus
forecast suggests that the indicator will decrease by 2.5% in the first
quarter, but not all experts are so pessimistic. SMBC Nikko Securities
believes the economy will shrink by 11.5%.

However, as the American experience shows, it is unnecessary to have
robust macro statistics for a rapid rally of the stock index. The
massive fiscal stimulus of official Tokyo and the ultra-easy monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the Bank of Japan allow [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s to forget about the risk.
With the [Nikkei 225][3] rise, foreigners hedge against the foreign
exchange risks of local investment by selling the yen. As a result, its
inverse correlation with the stock market is mushrooming.

[In the previous article][4], I stated that the main driver of the
[USDJPY][1] and [EURJPY][2] rallies in 2021 would be an increase in risk
appetite amid expectations of a global economic recovery. I maintain
this point of view, but currently, the market is increasingly focused on
trade based on vaccination speed. In these [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/), Japan loses both to
the United States, where 25.2 million people (7.6% of the population)
were inoculated, and the European Union (10.1 million or 2.3%). So far,
Tokyo prefers to fight COVID-19 with lockdowns, which puts the yen in a
losing position. Indeed, the number of infected people in Japan is
decreasing, but this is not enough.

In the short term, the [USDJPY][1] and [EURJPY][2] bulls should go ahead
by the shortcomings in the fight against the COVID-19, the depth of the
recession in the Japanese economy, and foreigners' intention to hedge
against the Forex risks of investing in Nikkei 225. In the medium and
long term, the yen will finally be drowned by the global economic
recovery.

### [USDJPY][1] and [EURJPY][2] trading plan for six months

Since my [previous forecasts][5], the [USDJPY][1] and [EURJPY][2] pairs
have grown by 1.2% each. It is equivalent to almost two figures, and I
still see no reason to abandon the buying strategy based on the decline
of prices. The US dollar and the euro's target areas are still zones
¥107-108 and ¥ 129-130, respectively.
