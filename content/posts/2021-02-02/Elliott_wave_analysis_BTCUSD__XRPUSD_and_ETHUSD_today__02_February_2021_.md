Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 02.02.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

All three cryptocurrency pairs are forming the final legs of corrective
waves, so the prices should be declining in the short term.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

 ****

The market continues forming the down corrective wave 4 as a triple
zigzag. The first four sub-waves [W]-[X]-[Y]-[X] have completed the sub-
waves (a), (b) and (c) of smaller degree. There is currently unfolding
the final motive wave [Z], which can also complete as a simple zigzag
(a)-(b)-(c). The final impulse (c) could drive the price to a level of
28800.00, marked by wave [Y]. One could enter sell positions in the
current situation.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Sell 33835.50 TP 28800.00

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

 ****

The XRPUSD market is forming the global impulse wave, where the
corrective wave (2) has recently completed as a simple zigzag a-b-c.
There is developing the initial element of wave (3). The price has
sharply increased in impulse 1. Next, it has started declining in the
corrective wave 2. Correction 2 could end as a simple zigzag a-b-c; the
wave should finish at a level of around 0.310, as it is outlined in the
chart. At this level, wave 2 will be 76.4% of wave 1.

### Trading plan for **[XRPUSD][2]** today:

Sell 0.381, TP 0.310

## Elliott wave Ethereum analysis

 ****

In the upward impulse wave (5), there is forming the horizontal
corrective wave 4 as a triangle [A]-[B]-[C]-[D]-[E]. The sub-waves
[A]-[B]-[C]-[D] have completed, and the final sub-wave [E] is still
developing. Wave [E] should complete as a double zigzag (w)-(x)-(y),
where wave (y) is a triple zigzag. The Ethereum price should be
declining in wave z to a level of 1170.00. Next, the market should turn
up and start rising in impulse 5.

### Trading plan for  **[ETHUSD][3] **today:

Sell 1373.23, TP 1170.00
