Euro is desperate. Forecast as of 02.02.2021Dmitri Demidenko

At the beginning of the year, the confidence in the euro strengthening
was undermined. The divergences in the economic growth and the
vaccination speed make [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s doubt in the idea of the global GDP
expansion and the [EURUSD][1] rise to 1.25. But there are still some
optimists. Let us discuss the Forex outlook and make up a trading plan.

## Weekly euro fundamental forecast

The worse it is, the better. The faster the US stock indexes were
falling, the worse the US economic situation became, the more
aggressively the Fed reacted to the recession provoked by the pandemic,
the better it was with the adoption of the fiscal stimulus packages by
Congress. However, the opposite is true for the economy and financial
markets. The better, the worse. Raising forecasts for US GDP casts doubt
on the need for the additional $ 1.9 trillion in aid. But for the ‘blue
wave,’ Joe Biden’s stimulus plan wouldn’t have approved by the
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers. The less the stimulus is, the worse the [EURUSD][1] bulls
feel.

According to the Congressional Budget Office, the US economy will be
able to return to its pre-crisis level by the middle of this year. By
the end of 2021, the US GDP will grow by 3.7% and expand by another 2.2%
in 2022. Average growth in 2021-2025 will be 2.6%, primarily due to
large-scale fiscal incentives. The $900-billion aid package will add
1.5% to the US growth this year and next. A natural question arises, if
everything is so good, why the US government should continue to
accumulate debts on such a scale? Republican senators are confident that
there is no need. They offered Biden a stimulus plan of $618 billion.
Joe Biden, who must have been inspired by Janet Yellen's announcement to
play big, said he would insist on an aggressive stimulus.

Stock markets are encouraged by the idea of a $1.9-trillion aid package,
the rapid speed of vaccination, and the decline in the number of
COVID-19 cases, but something is wrong with the global risk appetite.
The [S&P 500][2] started falling amid Jerome Powell's press conference,
and this is not accidental. The Fed Chairman convinced the markets that
the US central bank would not pull back on the QE, but it is not enough
amid the expansion of the bond issue volume. Is the current asset
purchase at a monthly pace of $120 billion in fact scaling down the
quantitative easing program?

The widening gap between the Treasury bond issue and the Fed's Treasury
purchases is bad [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) for inflation expectations, debt holders, and
dollar bears. Besides, there is a divergence in the vaccination rate (in
the US, 7% of the population were vaccinated, in the EU - 2.2%), so one
could suggest that the [EURUSD][1] uptrend has broken down.

However, there still some positive factors. The rise of Italy’s
manufacturing PMI suggests that the idea of the global economic recovery
and the euro strengthening could still work out. With a 13% share of
machinery and equipment exports, compared with 4% in Spain, Italy is
experiencing increased demand from a rapidly expanding China’s economy.

### Weekly [EURUSD][1] trading plan

The [EURUSD][1] bulls are desperately fighting for level 1.208. However,
it will make sense to enter longs in the zone of 1.195-1.2 or if the
price rolls back above level 1.215. Currently, it is relevant to enter
short-term sell trades.
