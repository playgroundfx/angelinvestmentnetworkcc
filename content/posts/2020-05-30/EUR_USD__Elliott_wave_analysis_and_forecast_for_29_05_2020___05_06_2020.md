EUR/USD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 29/05/2020 –
05/06/2020Alex Geuta

## The pair [EUR/USD][1] remains likely to grow. Estimated pivot point
is at a level of 1.1017.

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions from corrections above the
level of 1.0871 with a target of 1.1250 – 1.1490.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
1.0871 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of 1.0633
– 1.0528.

 **Analysis:** Supposedly, a descending correction of senior level
finished developing in the form of wave (2) on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame. The
third wave (3) started developing on the H4 time frame, with wave iii of
1 of (3) forming inside. Apparently, the third wave of smaller degree
(iii) of iii of 1 is developing on the H1 time frame.  If this
assumption is correct, the pair will continue to rise to 1.1250 –
1.1490. The level of 1.0871 is critical in this scenario. Its breakout
will allow the pair to continue falling to the levels of 1.0633 –
1.0528.
