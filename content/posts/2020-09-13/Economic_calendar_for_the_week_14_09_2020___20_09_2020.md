Economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the week 14.09.2020 – 20.09.2020Jana Kane

##  **Review of the main events of the Forex economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the
next trading week (14.09.2020 – 20.09.2020)**

 **Trading on key Forex [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/): next week we are expecting the publication
of important macro statistics from China, Great Britain, US, New
Zealand, Australia, Canada, as well as the result of the voting in the
British Parliament on Brexit and meetings of the central banks of Great
Britain, Japan, and the US.**

The dollar has strengthened, and the American stock indices have
declined by the end of last week, and, this is the second week of the
strengthening of the dollar and the fall of stock indices. Their inverse
correlation is still observed.

One of the most important events of the past week was the ECB meeting.
The central bankers decided to leave interest rates unchanged at 0.00%
(for major refinancing operations) and -0.50% (deposit rate). The ECB
also left the volume of asset purchases  under the PEPP program at 1.350
billion euros and confirmed its intention to continue buying assets
under this program until the end of June 2021. Euro quotes skyrocketed,
but only after it became known that ECB leaders believe that there is no
need to overreact to the euro's rise.

The EUR/USD pair rose to an intra-week high near 1.1917, but then
declined almost returning to last week's opening price near 1.1840.

Still, the dollar remains vulnerable amid the Fed's stimulus [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), the
steady progress of the US coronavirus pandemic and political uncertainty
ahead of the November presidential election, and its current gain can be
a correction after a sharp decline over the previous 4 months.

Next week, three of the world's largest central banks (Bank of England,
Bank of Japan and the Fed) will hold their regular meetings and decide
on the interest rates. Economists do not expect the leaders of these
banks to make any changes to the current monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), although
unexpected decisions are also possible. Any movements or signals in the
direction of further easing of the policies of these banks will cause
increased volatility in the financial markets and weakening of GBP, JPY,
or USD, respectively.

Investors will also pay attention to the publication of important macro
statistics on China, UK, US, New Zealand, Australia, Canada, as well as
the results of the vote in the British parliament on Brexit scheduled
for Monday.

 **Traders should pay attention to the publication of the following
macro indicators:**

 ***during the coming week, new events may be added to the [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) and
/ or some scheduled events may be canceled**

 ****** **GMT time**

###  **Monday, September 14**

###  **GBP Inflation report (exact time unknown)**

Head of the Bank of England and members of the Monetary Policy Committee
of the Bank of England will speak in parliament with comments on the
current economic situation and economic outlook. At this time, the
volatility in trading on the pound may rise sharply. Apart from GDP, one
of the main reference points for the Bank of England regarding the
prospects for monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) in the UK is the inflation rate. If the
tone of the report is soft, the British stock market will gain support
and the pound will decline. Conversely, tough rhetoric of the Bank of
England representatives regarding inflation control implying an increase
in the interest rate in the UK will lead to the strengthening of the
pound.

###  **GBP Brexit vote in the British parliament (exact time unknown)**

British Prime Minister Johnson's press secretary said last week that the
country is still ready to make a deal with the EU. “We need to make
progress on the domestic market bill so that it can be included in the
law early next year,” he said. When asked if he thought parliament would
support the bill, he said he hoped parliament understood the importance
of preserving the domestic market.

Meanwhile, in relation to this law, the European Commission has already
addressed the British government with a warning that if the UK passes
the bill on the domestic market, it would be a serious violation of the
provisions of the Brexit treaty and the Northern Ireland Protocol and
urged the British government to abandon the provisions of the bill.

On Monday, the British parliament is likely to consider all [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/)
regarding the prospects for a Brexit deal with the EU. If parliament
approves this plan, the likelihood of a hard Brexit will increase
sharply, which will negatively affect the pound quotes.

###  **Tuesday, September 15**

###  **01:30 AUD Minutes of the September meeting of the RB of
Australia**

This document is published two weeks after the meeting and the decision
on the interest rate. If the RBA positively assesses the state of the
labor market in the country, the rate of GDP growth, and also shows a
hawkish attitude towards the inflation forecast in the economy, the
markets regard this as a higher probability of a rate hike at the next
meeting, which is a positive factor for the AUD. The bank's soft
rhetoric regarding, above all, inflation puts pressure on the AUD.

At its September meeting, the central bank kept its current monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) unchanged. The key interest rate of the RBA was kept at a record
low level of 0.25%, and the target yield on 3-year government bonds was
also left at the level of 0.25%. The decision to lower the rate and
determine the current target level of government bond yields was made at
the previous unscheduled RBA meeting on March 19 in order to support
businesses and Australian citizens amid the rapid spread of the
coronavirus pandemic. The country's government was also forced to
introduce a social distancing regime, suspend businesses and close
borders to international traffic.

“Substantial uncertainty remains about the short-term outlook for the
Australian economy,” Head of the RBA Philip Lowe said after the bank
meeting, adding that “the board will not raise rates until there is
progress towards full employment and confidence that inflation will
stabilize in the target range of 2-3%". In his opinion, "there are no
serious arguments in favor of tightening monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) in the short
term," and "some time will pass before interest rates rise."

Nevertheless, if the published minutes contain unexpected information
concerning the issues of the RBA's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), the volatility in
the AUD quotes will increase.

###  **02:00** **CNY Retail Sales Index**

This index is published monthly by the National Bureau of Statistics of
China and measures the total retail sales and cash proceeds. The index
is often considered an indicator of consumer confidence and economic
well-being and reflects the health of the retail sector in the near
term. A rise in the index is usually positive for the CNY; a decrease in
the indicator will negatively affect CNY. The previous value of the
index (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) was -1.1% (after an increase of +8% in the last
months of 2019 and a fall of -20.5% in January 2020). Outlook: In
August, retail sales in China fell by -1.4%, which indicates a weak
recovery after a strong fall in February-March this year. If the data
turns out to be even weaker, the CNY will decline.

###  **06:00 GBP Report on the average wages of the British for the last
3 months. Unemployment rate**

Every month, the UK Office for National Statistics (ONS) publishes a
report on average wages covering the last 3 months, with and and without
bonuses.

This report is a key short-term indicator of the dynamics of changes in
the level of wages of employees in the UK. Wages growth is positive for
the GBP, while a low reading is negative. Forecast: the September report
suggests that the average wages with bonuses decreased over the last
calculated 3 months (May-July) by -1.1% (against -1.2%, -0.3%, +1.0 %,
+2.4%, +2.8%, +3.1%, +2.9%, +3.2%, +3.2% in previous periods); without
bonuses - by -0.6% (against -0.2%, +0.7%, +1.7%, +2.7%, +2.9%, +3.1%,
+3.2%, +3.4%, +3.5% in previous periods). Thus, the indicator is
expected to be below the average values. If the data turns out to be
better than forecast, the pound is likely to strengthen in the foreign
exchange market in the short term. Data worse than expected will
negatively affect the pound.

Also at this time, the office publishes data on unemployment in the UK.
It is expected that in the 3 months from May to July, unemployment was
at the level of 3.9% (against 3.9%, 3.9%, 3.9%, 3.9%, 4.0%, 3.9% and
3.8% in previous periods). Since 2012, the UK unemployment rate has
steadily declined (from 8.0% in September 2012). This is a positive
factor for the pound, while unemployment growth is a negative factor.

If the data from the UK labor market turn out to be worse than the
forecast and / or the previous value, then the pound will be under
pressure.

In any case, at the time of the publication of data from the British
labor market, an increase in volatility in the pound quotes and on the
London Stock Exchange is expected.

###  **Wednesday, September 16**

###  **06:00 GBP Consumer Price Index. Core Consumer Price Index**

Consumer Price Index (CPI) reflects the dynamics of retail prices for a
group of goods and services that make up the British consumer basket.
CPI is a key indicator of inflation. Its publication causes active
movement of the pound in the foreign exchange market, as well as the
London Stock Exchange FTSE100 index.

In the previous reporting month (July), the growth in consumer inflation
(in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) amounted to 1.0%.

Forecast for August: +1.3% (annualized). This value is unlikely to
provide significant support to the pound. Indicator value below the
forecast could provoke a weakening of the pound, as low inflation will
force the Bank of England to adhere to a soft monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).

Core CPI is published by the Office for National Statistics and
determines the price change of a selected basket of goods and services
(excluding food and energy) for a given period. It is a key indicator
for assessing inflation and changes in purchasing preferences. A
positive result strengthens the GBP, a negative result weakens it.

In July, Core CPI (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) increased by +1.8%. The publication
of the indicator is likely to have a positive effect on the pound if its
value is higher than the forecast and the previous value. Outlook for
August: +1.4% (annualized). The indicator reading below the forecast and
previous values ​​may provoke a weakening of the pound.

###  **12:30 USD Retail sales (ex Autos). Retail control group**

This report (Core Retail Sales Ex Autos) reflects the total sales of
retailers of all sizes and types, excluding car dealerships. Changes in
retail sales are the main indicator of consumer spending. The report is
leading, and in the future the data may be strongly revised. A high
result strengthens the US dollar, a low one weakens it. A relative
decrease in the indicator may have a short-term negative impact on the
dollar, while an increase in the indicator will have a positive effect
on the USD. In the previous month (July), the indicator increased by
+1.9% (against a decline of -17.2% in April, -4.5% in March, -0.4% in
February).

Retail sales is the main indicator of consumer spending in the United
States showing changes in retail sales. The Retail Control Group metric
measures volume across the entire retail industry and is used to
calculate price indices for most products. A strong result strengthens
the US dollar, and vice versa, a weak report weakens the dollar. A
slight increase in indicators is unlikely to accelerate the growth of
the dollar. Data worse than the values ​​of the previous period (+1.4%
in July, +5.6% in June, +11% in May, -15.3% in April, +1.7% in March,
0.0% in January and in February) will negatively affect the dollar in
the short term.

###  **12:30 CAD Consumer Price Indices in Canada**

Core Consumer Price Index (Core CPI) from the Bank of Canada reflects
the dynamics of the retail prices of the corresponding basket of goods
and services (excluding fruits, vegetables, gasoline, fuel oil, natural
gas, mortgage interest, intercity transport, and tobacco products). The
target inflation rate for the Bank of Canada is in the range of 1-3%.
The rise in CPI is a harbinger of a rate hike and a positive factor for
the CAD. Core Consumer Price Index rose in July by +0.7% (in annual
[terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)), in May - by +0.7%, and in April - by +1.2%. If the August data
turns out to be worse than the previous values, it will negatively
affect the CAD. Better-than-forecast data and above previous values
​​will strengthen the Canadian dollar.

Outlook for August: CPI will come out with a value of +0.9% (in annual
[terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)).

###  **18:00 USD The Fed's decision on the interest rate. Summary of
Economic Projections from the US Federal Open Market Committee. The
Fed's Comments on Monetary Policy**

Following two meetings in March, the Fed cut its interest rate to 0.25%
from 1.75% in February and announced the allocation of $700 billion for
the purchase of US government bonds and mortgage-backed securities.
Subsequently, the Fed has repeatedly announced additional measures to
support the American economy and inject cheap liquidity into the
financial system. Usually, with the easing of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), the
national currency becomes cheaper and its quotations go down.

In recent months, the dollar has been declining as [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are
withdrawing funds from defensive assets, buying riskier and more
profitable assets of the stock market, which continues to grow despite
the threat of a second wave of the coronavirus epidemic and the
associated economic slowdown. The dollar's role as a defensive asset is
also declining.

The rate is widely expected to remain at 0.25% at this meeting. At the
end of May, the US Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said that he
was "satisfied with the current situation and the path we (at the Fed)
are now heading." "We are not close to any of our limits," - said
Powell, making it clear that the Fed intends to continue to support the
economy. Other Fed leaders have also repeatedly stated in recent days
that they are in favor of continuing the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of supporting the
American economy.

Nevertheless, during the period when the rate decision is published,
volatility may sharply grow throughout the financial market, primarily
in the American stock market and in dollar quotes, if the rate decision
differs from the forecast.

The FOMC Economic Projections include the Fed's report on inflation and
economic growth over the next 2 years and, just as important, shows the
individual views of the FOMC members on interest rates.

During the publication of the decision on the rate and the FOMC report,
a surge in volatility is expected throughout the financial market,
primarily in the American stock market and in dollar quotes.

Powell's comments may affect both short-term and long-term USD trading.
A more hawkish stance on the Fed's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) is seen as positive
and strengthens the US dollar, while a more cautious position is seen as
negative for the USD. Any hints by Powell about the possibility of
raising the interest rate will cause the dollar to strengthen and the
American stock markets to fall.

Investors want to hear him talk about the future plans of the Fed for
this and next year.

###  **18:30 USD Press Conference of the FOMC (Federal Open Market
Committee)**

The press conference of the US Federal Reserve Committee on Open Markets
lasts about an hour. In the first part, the ruling is read, followed by
a series of questions and answers that can increase market volatility.

Powell's comments may affect both short-term and long-term USD trading.
A more hawkish stance on the Fed's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) is seen as positive
and strengthens the US dollar, while a more cautious position is seen as
negative for the USD. Any hints by Powell about the possibility of
raising the interest rate will cause the dollar to strengthen and the
American stock markets to fall.

###  **22:45 NZD New Zealand GDP for Q2**

The release of this data will cause increased volatility in the NZD.
Despite the recent drop in commodity and agricultural prices (especially
dairy products, which is a major contributor to New Zealand's exports)
and the coronavirus pandemic hitting the global economy, it is likely
that New Zealand's Q2 GDP report will come out with negative indicators,
as it will reflect the situation in the economy, mainly after the first
wave of coronavirus, which affected New Zealand least of all compared to
other large economies.

GDP in the 2nd quarter of 2020 is expected to decline by -1.0% (previous
values ​​of -1.6%, +0.5% and +0.7%), but increased by +0.3% y / y
(previous values ​​-0.2% and +1.8% for the 4th quarter of 2019), which
is unlikely to have a favorable effect on the positions of the New
Zealand currency. If the data is better than forecast, the NZD will
strengthen. Data worse than forecast and previous values ​​could
negatively affect the NZD.

###  **Thursday, Spetember 17**

###  **01:30 AUD Employment rate. Unemployment rate**

Employment rate reflects the monthly change in the number of Australian
citizens employed. The growth of the indicator has a positive impact on
consumer spending, which stimulates economic growth. A high value is
positive for the AUD, while a low value is negative. Forecast: in
August, the number of employed Australian citizens increased by 40,000
(after falling in April by 594,300, in May - by 227,700 and an increase
by 114,700 in July).

Also at the same time, the Australian Bureau of Statistics will publish
a report on the unemployment rate - an indicator that assesses the ratio
of unemployed population to the total number of able-bodied citizens.
The growth of the indicator indicates the weakness of the labor market,
which leads to a weakening of the national economy. The decline in the
indicator is a positive factor for the AUD. Forecast: unemployment in
Australia in August was at 7.8% (against 7.5% in July, 7.4% in June,
5.2% in March, 5.1% in February). In general, the indicators cannot be
described as positive yet. However, in other large economies, the labor
market has deteriorated on an even larger scale due to the coronavirus.

The leaders of the RBA have repeatedly stated that, in addition to the
situation in international trade, the Australian economy and the central
bank's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) plans are influenced by the level of household
debt and expenditures, the growth of workers' wages, as well as the
state of the country's labor market.

In March 2020, the RB of Australia cut its key interest rate by 0.50% to
a new all-time low of 0.25% due to the coronavirus, which was the 5th
rate cut in the last year. In the opinion of the RBA management, an
unemployment rate of 4.5% or lower is required to raise wages and
accelerate inflation to the target range. Unemployment in the country is
not declining, and a return of inflation to the middle of the target
range of 2-3% is not even in the distant horizon.

The AUD is unlikely to react positively to the publication of data from
the country's labor market. If the values ​​of the indicators turn out
to be worse than forecast, the Australian dollar may significantly
decline in the short term. Better-than-expected data will strengthen the
AUD in the short term.

###  **03:00 JPY Bank of Japan's decision on interest rate. Bank of
Japan's press conference and comments on monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)**

The Bank of Japan will decide on the interest rate. At the moment, the
main rate in Japan is in negative territory, amounting to -0.1%. Most
likely, the rate will remain the same. If it is reduced and deepens into
negative territory, such a decision will cause a sharp decline in the
yen in the foreign exchange market and an increase in the Japanese stock
market. In any case, during this period of time, a surge in volatility
is expected in trading in the yen and the Asian financial market.

In June and July, during its regular meetings, the Bank of Japan kept
the deposit rate at -0.1%, and the target level of 10-year bonds at 0%,
and kept the annual target level of [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/) purchases at 12 trillion yen.
The Bank of Japan has expanded its business aid program to 110 trillion
yen from 75 trillion yen. Under this program, companies can obtain loans
without collateral and at a zero interest rate. The goal of the program
is to support commercial companies whose bankruptcy rates have
skyrocketed in Japan over the past month due to the coronavirus
pandemic. In a related statement, the Bank of Japan said that the bank's
management will continue to "increase the monetary base until inflation
is stable above 2%." “We will not hesitate to take additional easing
measures if necessary,” the bank also traditionally said in a statement.

During the press conference, head of the Bank of Japan Haruhiko Kuroda
will comment on the bank's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). The Bank of Japan continues
to adhere to its super-soft monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). As Kuroda has stated on
several occasions, "it is appropriate for Japan to patiently continue
with its current loose monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)." Markets usually react
noticeably to Kuroda's speeches. He will probably touch upon the topic
of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) during his speech, which will cause an increase in
volatility not only in the yen trade, but also throughout the Asian and
global financial markets.

If the bank's executives decide that the Japanese economy is stable and
the momentum of inflation towards the 2% target is not diminishing, they
will refrain from changing [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).

###  **06:00 JPY Press Conference of the Bank of Japan**

During the press conference, head of the Bank of Japan Haruhiko Kuroda
will comment on the bank's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). Despite the earlier measures
taken by the bank to stimulate the Japanese economy, inflation remains
low, production and consumption are falling, which negatively affects
export-oriented Japanese manufacturers. Markets usually react noticeably
to Kuroda's speeches. If he touches on the topic of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
during his speech, volatility will increase not only in trading in the
yen, but throughout the Asian and global financial markets.

###  **11:00 GBP Bank of England's decision on interest rate. Bank of
England's meeting minutes. Planned volume of asset purchases by the Bank
of England. Monetary Policy Report.**

In March (11 March and 19 March), during its extraordinary meetings, the
Bank of England cut its interest rate twice, bringing it to the level of
0.1%, and announced its intention to purchase UK government bonds in the
amount of 200 billion British pounds in an attempt to counteract
economic damage from the coronavirus pandemic. The central bank
announced that it would increase its bond portfolio to £645 billion,
then to £745 billion from £445 billion at the time. "The current
situation is completely unprecedented," the new Head of the Bank of
England Andrew Bailey said at a press conference following the March 19
emergency meeting. Bailey said he expects a sharp economic contraction
due to the coronavirus, and the Bank of England stands ready to take
further stimulus measures if necessary. “No, we are not done yet,” he
said. Based on these statements by Andrew Bailey, it is fair to expect
further actions from the Bank of England in the direction of easing its
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). It is possible that at this meeting on September 17,
the Bank of England will again undertake them, increasing the volume of
purchases of bonds or lowering the interest rate. Although, most
economists believe that the Bank of England will refrain from changing
the current monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) for now.

Also at this time, the minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of
the Bank of England are published with the distribution of votes "for"
and "against" raising / lowering the interest rate. The main risks for
the UK after Brexit are associated with expectations of a slowdown in
the country's economic growth, as well as with a large current account
deficit in the UK balance of payments.

The intrigue about the further actions of the Bank of England remains.
And in trading the pound and the FTSE100 index, a lot of trading
opportunities will be there during the period of publication of the
bank's decision on rates.

Also at the same time, the Bank of England's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) report will
be published, containing an assessment of the economic outlook. At this
time, the volatility in the pound quotes may rise sharply. Apart from
GDP, one of the main reference points for the Bank of England regarding
the prospects for monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) in the UK is the inflation rate. If
the tone of the report is soft, the British stock market will gain
support and the pound will decline. Conversely, the report's tough
rhetoric on curbing inflation, implying an increase in interest rates in
the UK, will strengthen the pound.

###  **Friday, September 18**

###  **12:30 CAD Retail Sales Index**

Retail Sales Index is published monthly by Statistics Canada and
estimates total retail sales. The index is often considered an indicator
of consumer confidence and reflects the health of the retail sector in
the near term. A rise in the index is usually positive for the CAD; a
decrease in the indicator will negatively affect the CAD. The previous
value of the index (in June) was +23.7% after falling in March by -9.9%
and growing in May by +18.7%. If the data for July turns out to be
weaker than the previous value, the CAD may decline in the short term.
Forecast for July: +24.5%.

###  **14:00 USD University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index
(preliminary release)**

This indicator reflects the confidence of American consumers in the
country's economic development. A high level indicates economic growth,
while a low level indicates stagnation. Previous indicator values: 99.8
in January, 101.1 in February, 89.1 in March, 71.8 in April, 72.3 in
May, 78.1 in June, 72.5 in July, 74.1 in August. An increase in the
indicator will strengthen the USD, while a decrease in the value will
weaken the dollar. This indicator is expected to be released in
September with a value of 76.0. There is still a weak trend towards a
gradual recovery in the growth of the indicator. Poor data may
negatively affect the dollar in the short term.
