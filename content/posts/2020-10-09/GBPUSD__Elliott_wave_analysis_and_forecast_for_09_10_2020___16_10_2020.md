GBPUSD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 09.10.2020 –
16.10.2020Alex Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions from corrections above the
level of 1.2673 with a target of 1.3284 – 1.3485.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
1.2673 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of 1.2443
– 1.2200.

 **Analysis:** Presumably, the first wave of larger degree (1) continues
developing on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame, with wave 3 of (3) formed inside.
Apparently, a local correction formed as the fourth wave 4 of (3) on the
H4 time frame. Apparently, the ascending fifth wave 5 of (3) started
developing on the H1 time frame, with wave  i of 5 formed and local
correction ii of 5 developing inside. If the presumption is correct, the
pair may be expected to rise to the  levels of 1.3284 – 1.3485. The
level of 1.2673 is critical in this scenario, as the breakout will
enable the pair to continue declining to the levels of 1.2443 – 1.2200.
