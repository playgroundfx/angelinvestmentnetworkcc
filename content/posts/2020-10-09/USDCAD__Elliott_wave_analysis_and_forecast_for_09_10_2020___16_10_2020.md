USDCAD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 09.10.2020 –
16.10.2020Alex Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions from corrections above the
level of 1.3128 with a target of 1.3419 – 1.3500.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
1.3128 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of 1.2990
– 1.2870.

 **Analysis:** Wave (С) of 4 of larger degree continues developing on
the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame, with the first wave 1 of (C) formed inside. An
ascending correction is developing as wave 2 of (С) on the H4 time
frame, with wave a of 2 forming inside. On the H1 time frame, the third
wave of smaller degree (iii) of a appears to have formed, and a local
correction is nearing completion in the form of wave (iv) of a,
presumably. If the presumption is correct, the pair will continue to
rise to the levels of 1.3419 – 1.3500. The level of 1.3128 is critical
in this scenario, as the breakout will enable the pair to continue
declining to the levels of 1.2990 – 1.2870.
