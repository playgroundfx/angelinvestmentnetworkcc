Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 09.10.2020Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I suggest entry signals
to trade each cryptocurrency.

All cryptocurrency pairs are forming the bullish impulse sub-waves of a
smaller degree, which are half-complete. Therefore, one could enter long
trades on the Bitcoin, Ripple, Ethereum.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

 ****

The BTCUSD market continues forming the bullish double zigzag, with the
final wave (Y) developing as a double combination inside. The sub-waves
W and X have completed, the final wave Y is still unfolding. It is
composed of three motive sub-waves [a]-[b]-[c]. At the time of writing,
the impulse wave [c] has been half-complete, so, the price should
continue rising in wave [c] towards level 11315.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 10639.75, TP 11315.00

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

 ****

The XRPUSD market continues forming the simple down zigzag A-B-C. Wave A
has completed as a five-wave impulse [1]-[2]-[3]-[4]-[5]. There is now
developing the bullish correction B as a standard zigzag [a]-[b]-[c].
The upward impulse wave [c] should continue rising to a level of 0.266,
it is the final leg of the zigzag.

### Trading plan for **[XRPUSD][2]** today:

Buy 0.250, TP 0.266

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

 ****

There is now forming the final impulse wave that is a part of the down
zigzag A-B-C. The bearish impulse wave [1] finished, and the market is
now rising in the corrective wave [2]. Correction [2] is composed of the
sub-waves (A)-(B)-(C). The first two legs of the zigzag look complete,
so the ETHUSD market should be rising in the final wave (C) towards the
level of 374.61.

### Trading plan  **[ETHUSD][3] **today:

Buy 348.82, TP 374.61
