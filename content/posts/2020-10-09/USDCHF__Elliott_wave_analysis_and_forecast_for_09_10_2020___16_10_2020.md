USDCHF: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 09.10.2020 -
16.10.2020Alex Geuta

 **Main scenario:** Consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 0.9298 with a target of 0.8900 – 0.8800.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
0.9298 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 0.9398 –
0.9497.

 **Analysis:** Presumably, a descending third wave of larger degree (3)
continues developing on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame, with wave 1 of (3) forming
inside. Wave v of 1 is developing on the H4 time frame. Wave (iii) of v
formed and a local correction developed in the form of wave (iv) of v
inside wave v of 1. Apparently, wave (v) of v started forming on the H1
time frame. If the presumption is correct, the pair may be expected to
fall to the levels of  0.8900 – 0.8800. The level of 0.9298 is critical
in this scenario. Its breakout will allow the pair to continue rising to
the levels of 0.9398 – 0.9497.
