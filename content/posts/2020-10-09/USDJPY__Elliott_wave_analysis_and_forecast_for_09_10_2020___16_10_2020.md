USDJPY: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 09.10.2020 –
16.10.2020Alex Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions from corrections above the
level of 104.90 with a target of 108.14 – 109.84.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
104.90 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of 103.92
– 103.00.

 **Analysis:** On the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame, apparently a descending
correction of larger degree finished forming as wave B, and wave С
started developing, with the first wave 1 of (1) of C formed inside. On
the H4 time frame, a descending correction of smaller degree finished
forming as wave 2 of (1), with wave c of 2 developed inside. Apparently,
the third wave 3 of (1) started developing on the H1 time frame, with
the first counter-trend wave (i) of i of 3 forming inside. If the
presumption is correct, the pair will continue to rise to the levels of
108.14 – 109.84. The level of 104.90 is critical in this scenario, as
the breakout will enable the pair to continue declining to the levels of
103.92 – 103.00.
