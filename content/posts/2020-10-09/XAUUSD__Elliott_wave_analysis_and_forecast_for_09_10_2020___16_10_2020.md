XAUUSD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 09.10.2020 –
16.10.2020Alex Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions from corrections above the
level of 1848.26 with a target of 1973.73 – 2077.22.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
1848.26 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of
1750.33 – 1666.82.

 **Analysis:** The ascending third wave of larger degree (3) presumably
continues developing on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame, with wave 5 of (3) forming
inside. The third wave of smaller degree iii of 5 appears to have formed
on the H4 time frame, and presumably, a local correction finished
developing in the form of wave iv of 5. The fifth wave v of 5 started to
develop on the H1 time frame, with wave (i) of v developing inside. If
the presumption is correct, the pair will continue to rise to the levels
of 1973.73 – 2077.22. The level of 1848.26 is critical in this scenario,
as the breakout will enable the pair to continue declining to the levels
of 1750.33 – 1666.82.
