Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 06.04.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

Gold traders are trying to break out the resistance - Target Zone 1732 -
1727. If the price closes higher at the US session, the next growth
target will be Gold Zone 1755 - 1752.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

Yesterday, the short-term oil trend reversed down. As a result of the
reversal, last week's low was updated, and level 59.15 was broken out.
By the close of the US trading session, the price had corrected and is
now testing the broken out Intermediary Zone 59.68 - 59.42 from the
bottom up.

From yesterday's low, it is possible to build the new trend's key
resistance and get the boundaries of 60.45 - 60.20. Together with the
broken out Intermediary Zone, the resistance forms a zone of good sell
prices 60.45 - 59.42.

Today it is profitable to look for new short trades entered in the zone
of good sell prices with the target at the level of 57.35.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

Sell from the zone of 59.42 - 60.45. TakeProfit: 57.35. StopLoss: 61.00

Gold traders are trying to break out the resistance - Target Zone 1732 -
1727. If the price closes higher at the US session, the next growth
target will be Gold Zone 1755 - 1752.

Now the price is correcting and testing the local support 1730 - 1732.
Just below is the stronger support level 1726 - 1724. The trend border
is in the zone of 1713 - 1711.

Today, it is profitable to look for only gold purchases in all support
levels indicated above. The target will be today's high 1737.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

The short-term euro trend reversed up. Yesterday the Intermediary Zone
1.1792 - 1.1784 was broken out. The US trading session closed the price
above the level. Now the target for purchases is the Target Zone 1.1880
- 1.1864.

Now the price is correcting. Today, enter euro purchases at favorable
prices at strong levels. The nearest support is the Additional Zone
1.1781 - 1.1777. The trend border was formed in the zone of 1.1741 -
1.1733. Expect a correction and look for a pattern to enter buy trades.
It would be reasonable to take a part of profits at the level of 1.1817.
