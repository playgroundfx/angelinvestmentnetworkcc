Gold changes its course. Forecast as of 06.04.2021Dmitri Demidenko

[XAUUSD][1] prices were unable to drop more than 20% from the levels of
August record highs and move to the bear market. What will this mean for
gold? Let us analyze the gold outlook and make up a trading plan.

## Monthly gold fundamental forecast

Even though the first quarter for gold was the worst since 2016, and its
price reached the target of $1,675 per ounce set in the previous
article, my attitude towards the precious metal is changing. Over the
past four weeks, I have recommended traders to focus on selling
[XAUUSD][1]. Now the inability of traders to lower prices into the bear
market zone, which required a 20% decline in prices from the levels of
record highs, indicates their weakness. It also makes us look at the
prospects of XAUUSD in a different way.

The worst quarter for gold since 2016 was driven by the fastest sell-off
in the US Treasury market in decades. Debt market rates rose sharply on
strong US economic growth expectations, massive fiscal stimulus, and
rapid vaccination rates. At such times, the precious metal cannot
compete with interest-bearing assets, especially since the rise in the
cost of borrowing increased the costs of storing gold in [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/)s.

Gold traditionally shows increased sensitivity to the rates of the debt
market. However, since August, Treasuries' real yield has grown more
slowly than the [XAUUSD][1] prices fell. This suggests that the precious
metal is somewhat oversold. In my opinion, the fact that [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s and
speculators want quickly get rid of [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/) products and futures,
respectively, is the reason. Holdings of specialized exchange-traded
funds fell to their lowest level since May, while net longs fell to a
3-week bottom.

In March, gold traders believed in the idea of ​​a faster start of the
normalization of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) than the Fed was trying to introduce.
If so, then the comments of Loretta Mester, one of the FOMC's main
"hawks", that the Fed, despite the impressive statistics on US PMI for
March, will continue to be patient, came as a surprise to the
[XAUUSD][1] bears.

The gold situation can develop in three ways. If the central bank does
start raising rates before 2023, the gold will enter the bear market
territory and get stuck there for several years. If Jerome Powell and
his colleagues intend to remain passive for at least 2-2.5 years, the
current gold fall looks excessive. Finally, if, due to a disruption in
the supply chain and off-scale demand, the rise in inflation turns out
to be not temporary but long-lasting, [XAUUSD][1] prices will rise.

### Monthly gold trading plan

The factor of loss of [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) interest in the US dollar plays an
important role in changing my gold outlook. April for the greenback,
most likely, will not be as successful as March. The stabilization of
the debt market and the eurozone's economic recovery will worsen the
position of the USD index bulls and play into the hands of XAUUSD bulls.
However, I would not rush with entering long trades. Only the growth of
gold price above $1750-1755 per ounce will make it possible to suggest
the beginning of the gold uptrend.
