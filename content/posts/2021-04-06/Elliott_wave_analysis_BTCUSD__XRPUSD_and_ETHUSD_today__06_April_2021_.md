Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 06.04.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

Bitcoin and Ethereum are following the scenario earlier suggested. The
Ripple market has changed the expected trajectory. Let us explore the
market situation for each pair in more detail.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

Bitcoin continues developing the upward impulse wave 5 of a smaller
degree. Wave 5 is composed of five sub-waves [1]-[2]-[3]-[4]-[5]. The
first four parts of this impulse have completed. After the zigzag-shaped
correction [4] finished, the price has started growing in the final wave
[5], which could end as a simple impulse. Wave [5] could conclude a
larger impulse [5] at a level of around 61800.00. This is the previous
high made by wave 3. One could enter buy trades in the current
situation.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 58811.50, TP 61800.00

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

A sharp movement of the XRPUSD market suggests that there is developing
a bullish impulse, so the previous scenario is canceled. The market
should be forming the impulse wave [1]-[2]-[3]-[4]-[5], with the middle
part, impulse [3], developing inside. There should be forming the upward
wave (3) within wave [3] of a larger degree. An approximate trajectory
of the Ripple future price movement is outlined in the chart. The market
should be rising to a level of 0.965. Next, the price could start
declining in a corrective wave.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] today:

Buy 0.878, TP 0.965

* * *

## Elliott wave Ethereum analysis

The ETHUSD market situation is similar to that of the BTCUSD. The market
is forming bullish impulse (5), concluding a larger impulse wave [5] of
С. The first four legs of wave (5) seem to have completed. The price is
now rising in the final wave 5. The market is likely to reach level
2250.00. Next, the market should turn down and start declining to a
level around the previous low. One could enter long trades with a target
profit at the end of the C impulse.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Buy 2123.84, TP 2250.00
