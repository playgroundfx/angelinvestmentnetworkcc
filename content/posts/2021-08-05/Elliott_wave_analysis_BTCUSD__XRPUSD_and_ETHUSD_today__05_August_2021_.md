Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 05.08.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

The ETHUSD must have completed the ending diagonal, so the market should
be moving down.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

There is forming the initial part of the new bearish wave as an impulse
(1)-(2)-(3)-(4)-(5). The bearish impulse wave (1) and corrective wave
(2) look complete, so the price should continue declining in sub-wave
(3) to a level below 36370.00, marked by the B correction. One could
enter short trades.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Sell 39425.50, TP 36370.00

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

After the linking wave (X) finished, the Ripple price has started
declining. There should be forming the initial part of the bearish
impulse wave. There must have completed sub-waves [1] and [2], and there
is unfolding the down impulse [3]. The market should continue declining
to a level below 0.642. One could enter sell trades under the current
conditions.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] **** today:

Sell 0.726, TP 0.642

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

The ETHUSD market has risen a little since yesterday, and the chart lay
has been slightly changed. There should have completed the final fifth
wave of the impulse upwave [C], which completed as an ending diagonal.
Therefore, there must have started a new bearish trend. The market
should be declining to a level of 2450.00, marked by wave 4.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Sell 2704.07, TP 2450.00
