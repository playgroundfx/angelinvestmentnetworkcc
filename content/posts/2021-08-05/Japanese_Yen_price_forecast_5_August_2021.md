Yen takes Delta as ally. Forecast as of 05.08.2021Dmitri Demidenko

Another round of the pandemic boosted the demand for safe havens.
Investors believe that the central bank will abandon any plans for
monetary normalization because of COVID-19. Is it so? Let us discuss the
Forex outlook and make up a [USDJPY][1] trading plan.

## Weekly yen fundamental analysis

According to the Infectious Diseases Society, the spread of the delta
coronavirus variant has pushed the threshold for herd immunity from
60%-70% to well over 80% and potentially approaching 90%. This will be
very difficult to achieve given the slowdown in vaccination in the
United States. The economies will have to adapt to the coronavirus, and
central banks understand that they should not make monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
dependent on the pandemic waves. The Reserve Bank of Australia did not
want to change its plans to roll back monetary stimulus, despite
Sydney's lockdown and the growing risks of a new recession. This example
could inspire other central banks to tighten monetary policies, pressing
down safe havens, such as the Japanese yen and Swiss franc.

The yen and the franc enjoy increased attention of [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s in July-
August. Amid the Delta spread and the desire to avert risks, the
[USDJPY][1] was down to its monthly lows. The information that the
existing vaccines protect against the new strain of the coronavirus
discouraged the dollar bears.

The yen buyers are supported by a decline in Treasury yields, which
narrows the spread between the US and Japanese bind yields. Japanese
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s wring their money back to the country, as they have no better
alternative. Emerging Markets are not considered due to the low
availability of vaccines and the associated risks of slow economic
recovery. Germany’s 10-year bond yield is down to the lowest level since
February, the 30-year yield is below zero, making the yields on all
bonds negative. In general, the global negative-yielding bond market
volume increased to $16.5 trillion and moved towards its all-time high
of $18 trillion.

The matter is when the interest rates will start rising. Based on the
idea that the pandemic will eventually be defeated and the global
economy will continue to recover, the rates will inevitably rise.
According to JP Morgan forecasts, the Fed will reduce the asset purchase
pace under the QE from $960 billion in 2021 to $316 billion in 2022.
Therefore, the long-term USDJPY is bullish. The medium-term prospects
will depend on the Fed’s willingness to act according to the plan and
the global epidemiological situation.

The 10-year Treasury yield could rise from a six-month low because of
the US strong employment data. According to the FOMC member, Christopher
Waller Federal Reserve could begin slowing down its $120-billion bond
purchases once the non-farm payrolls add 800,000 – 1 million in July and
August.

### Weekly [USDJPY][1] trading plan

Jerome Powell's replacement Lael Brainard as chairman of the Federal
Reserve could shake the debt market. However, it is too early to talk
about it. If the US jobs report is strong, it will be relevant to enter
[USDJPY][1] longs on the breakouts of the resistance levels of 109.85
and 110.15. If the US employment data are weak, the pair will continue
declining.
