Dollar teaches a lesson. Forecast as of 05.08.2021Dmitri Demidenko

Investors are looking forward to the US employment data, but it doesn’t
mean the markets are calm. The [EURUSD][1] was jumping up and down,
which proves the market participants are nervous. Let us discuss the
Forex outlook and make up a trading plan.

## Fundamental US dollar forecast today

The [EURUSD][1] consolidation ahead of the US jobs report doesn’t seem
to be boring. There was a false breakout of the support a 1.185. Next,
the euro surged to the upper border of the trading range of $1.185 -
$1.19 amid a weak reading of the ADP US private sector employment and
crashed because the ISM US services PMI hit a record high of 64.1 in
July. Investors are nervous, and I wonder what the market reaction to
the non-farm payrolls will be.

Central banks have fulfilled their mission; they pulled the world
economy out of the recession. However, huge flows of cheap liquidity
poured into the financial system created bubbles in the asset markets
that could burst any time. The Fed and other regulators must be
extremely careful, they should normalize monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) slowly and be
ready to take a step back after two steps forward.

The same is true for the economy. Once it shows any signs of slowing
down or a W-shaped recovery, the Fed will immediately return to its
previous passive [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) or even boost the monetary stimulus. And the
main risk factor is the Delta. If vaccines fail to cope with this new
strain of COVID-19, the lockdowns will be likely to repeat, and there
could start another recession. What would you do in a similar situation?
I would buy bonds. And it looks like I'm not alone - the volume of the
negatively-yielding global bond market has been more than $ 16.5
trillion, the highest over the past five months.

The decline in the Treasury yields is another factor setting back the US
dollar. That is why the [EURUSD][1] reaction on August 4 is typical.
Reports that vaccines prevent the risk of hospitalization of those
infected with the delta variant of COVID-19 by 90%, according to the
Imperial College, as well as the surge in the US services PMI encouraged
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s to sell off Treasuries. The Treasury yields surged, and the
EURUSD went down below the support at 1.185.

The market believed that the Delta could be defeated, there would be no
new lockdowns, the US economy would continue to recover rapidly, and the
Fed could safely normalize monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). Federal Reserve Vice
Chairman Richard Clarida said the central bank's inflation and
unemployment targets will be met by the end of 2022, which will allow
the Fed to raise the federal funds rate in early 2023. FOMC member
Christopher Waller calls for a quick end to QE so that the Fed has room
for maneuver.

### [EURUSD][1] trading plan today

Of course, a weak rise of the APD private sector employment is a bad
sign. However, if the US jobs report for July is strong in general, and
the Delta will be defeated by vaccines, three will be no reason to sell
the US dollar. I suggest monitoring the market and expecting US non-farm
payrolls.
