Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

The EURUSD rate entered the zone of good buy prices 1.1850 – 1.1811.

The article covers the following subjects:

Target Zone. If the zone is broken out, the next target in the downtrend
will be the Gold Zone 65.70 – 65.43.

It is relevant to enter new shorts on the correction towards the strong
resistances. The strong resistance zones are the Additional Zone 69.05 –
68.91 and Intermediary Zone 70.55 — 70.28.

gold price broke out the Additional Zone 1818 – 1817 and tested the
resistance level of 1831. Long positions were closed around level 1831,
