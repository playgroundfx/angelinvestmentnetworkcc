Forecast for GBP/USD: Pound is threatened with taxesDmitri Demidenko

## Fundamental forecast for pound for today

### Britain’s unexpected toughening of fiscal discipline would be
unpleasant [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) for GBP/USD bulls

Having taken advantage of the USD’s weakness, the British pound easily
reached the first of the two targets at $1.337 set in the [previous
article][1] and almost got to the level of 1.35.  The reason for
[GBP/USD][2]’s rise was the greenback’s prostration with the Fed’s new
strategy of inflation control, not the pound’s strength. The
[EUR/GBP][3] and [GBP/JPY][4] pairs confirm that: they usually trade in
ranges. What’s more, a “thin” market isn’t a surprise in August, the
holidays season. However, everything may turn upside down in September.

The pound has enough problems: double deficit, Brexit, fear of British
QE expansion and tax hike rumours. The UK government debt reached £2
trillion for the first time in [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/). It frightened politicians so
much, that the Budget Responsibility Committee had to make some
calculations. According to them, the fiscal [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) has to be toughened
by £60 billion every ten years in order to have cut the debt from the
current 100% of GDP to 75% of GDP by 2070. It’s rumoured in London that
Treasury is planning to raise fuel, capital gains and corporation taxes
and cut pension tax relief.

I think this is not the right time. The economy hasn’t recovered yet,
while a tough fiscal [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) may suffocate positive changes. Most likely,
tax hikes will be delayed. If not, the pound will be sold on
expectations of a slower-than-expected GDP growth.

In September, the pound will be most likely affected by Brexit and
expectations of QE expansion at the BoE’s meeting on 17 September.
Andrew Bailey said at Jackson Hole that negative rates were the Central
Bank’s weapon that he wasn’t going to use. He also praised the QE
program, whose efficiency soars during market perturbations. Let me
remind you that Bailey cut REPO rate to its historic low at 0.1% and
expanded QE by £300 billion, bringing the total QE scale to £745
billion. On the whole, the BoE’s and the ECB’s positions are similar:
[EUR/USD][5]’s and [GBP/USD][2]’s rallies slow down inflation and
provide for monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)’s softening.  It increases the risk of these
pairs’ correction.

At the same time, the USD’s medium-term and long-term prospects remain
bearish. The PIMCO company, which has $1.92 trillion assets under
management, believes that the greenback will continue to devalue because
US full employment won’t return before 2024. It will force the Fed to
keep rates near zero for a long time.  The trade-weighted USD index
would lose 15-20% of its current levels on average during the previous
bearish times.

Thus, taking a long position in the pound is wise despite its domestic
trouble. As for [GBP/USD][2]’s correction, the situation will be clearer
once the US August labour stats have been released.  Strong employment
data will help bears to break the support levels at 1.33 and 1.3245.
