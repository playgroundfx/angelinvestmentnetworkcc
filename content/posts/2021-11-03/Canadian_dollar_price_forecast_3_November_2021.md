Pitfalls and traps on loonie's way. Forecast as of 03.11.2021Dmitri
Demidenko

Markets expect the overnight rate to rise by 125 bps in 2022, which,
amid a strong oil market, makes one wonder why [USDCAD][1] is not
falling? Let us discuss the Forex outlook and make up a trading plan.

## Weekly Canadian dollar fundamental forecast

It is hard to be the first. To be the first of the world's leading
central banks to raise rates. To be the first to taper QE. However, if a
bank decides to take such a step, your currency can strengthen. The Bank
of Canada's unexpected tapering of the QE program has surprised
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s and allowed the Loonie to confirm its status as the best 2021
G10 performer. At the same time, there are many pitfalls in the Canadian
economy. BoC's rivals, including the Fed, are on the alert, which casts
doubt on the continuation of the [USDCAD][1] decline.

Unexpected events serve as the most common reason for wide fluctuations
in exchange rates. Markets expected that the Bank of Canada would
announce the tapering of QE from CA$2 billion to CA$1 billion per week
at its October meeting. However, instead, the BoC completely abandoned
the program, announcing the start of the reinvestment phase. The BoC
will buy bonds worth CA$4-5 billion a week from November using
redeemable securities. As a result, the central bank's balance sheet
will remain at current levels, which means that monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) will
remain easy. Investors reacted to the BoC surprise [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) by selling
Canadian debt, which led to higher yield spreads with US counterparts
and a [USDCAD][1] decline. However, this will not last long.

At a press conference following the BoC meeting, Tiff Macklem noted that
the Canadian economy is approaching a full recovery, so it does not need
QE. At the same time, the Bank of Canada predicts an earlier return of
GDP to the trend, which should occur in the first half of 2022. Although
earlier, BoC officials expected this to happen in the second half of
2022. As a result, the derivatives market began to signal an increase in
the overnight rate in January. Moreover, by the end of next year,
borrowing costs may rise by 125 bps.

It remains a mystery how the Canadian dollar does not continue to
confidently strengthen against the backdrop of aggressive monetary
restrictions and a very strong oil market? This is due to doubts that
the economy of Canada is doing well. In September, GDP remained
virtually unchanged, and in the third quarter, it expanded slightly by
0.5% QoQ and by 2% YoY. The cut in economic growth forecasts for 2021 by
the Bank of Canada from 6% in July to 5.1% further raises doubts that
the overnight rate hike in 2022 will be steep.

However, the problems of the third quarter could be caused by an
increase in COVID-19 cases. In October, the situation began to change
for the better, which allows us to expect the fourth quarter with
optimism. Moreover, if Brent's price also grows to $120 per barrel, as
predicted by Bank of America, then the [USDCAD][1] downtrend will
quickly recover.

### Weekly [USDCAD][1] trading plan

In the meantime, the bears will have to "survive" the FOMC meeting and
the release of the US and Canadian job reports for October. These
reports are released at the same time, which allows selling [USDCAD][1]
towards 1.2295 in case of positive [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) from Canada and its inability to
stay above 1.2395. On the contrary, weak Canadian statistics will be an
argument in favor of the correction development.
