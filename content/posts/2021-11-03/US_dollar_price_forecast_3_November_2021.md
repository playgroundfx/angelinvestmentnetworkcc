Dollar is to hit the brake. Forecast as of 03.11.2021Dmitri Demidenko

Monetary normalization is often described as the central bank’s hitting
the brake. Nonetheless, the continued rally of the US stock indexes
raises doubts. Markets want explanations from the Fed. How will this
situation affect the [EURUSD][1]? Let us discuss the Forex outlook and
make up a trading plan.

## Fundamental US dollar forecast today

The Fed was a pioneer, having announced its $120-billion-a-month
quantitative easing program in the midst of the 2020 recession. The
announcement of the QE end, which [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s expect at the FOMC November
meeting, will be a notification that the mission has been completed. The
economy does not need extreme levels of liquidity. The central bank is
to quit the unconventional monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). The matter is what’s next.

When the Fed moves to cut back on asset purchases, the next important
question is when it will start tightening monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)? The timing of
the rate hikes is the main source of uncertainty and volatility in
Forex. The forecasts of the FOMC officials and Bloomberg experts suggest
that the first rate hike will take place either in 2022 or in 2023,
which significantly differs from market pricing. CME derivatives bet on
two or three federal funds rate hikes next year. Will this be a reason
for criticism from Jerome Powell?

According to Morgan Stanley, there is a sort of concord between the
market and the Fed. If [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are wrong, the central bank will point
it out. If the central bank doesn’t pay attention to the market signals,
it could be interpreted as “you are right.” Morgan Stanley expects the
Fed Chair to announce that markets’ signals are too early, but it may
not encourage [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s to sell off the dollar. Christine Lagarde has
already made this mistake.

Looking at the strong positions of the greenback ahead of the FOMC
meeting, one could wonder what hawkish surprise can the Fed present?
Most Bloomberg experts predict that asset purchases will be reduced by
$15 billion per month and be completed by July, but some of them believe
that the programme will finish earlier, in seven or one-to-six months.

### Forecasts for speed of QE tapering

Given that the economy no longer needs a quantitative easing program,
the Fed may say that the tapering does not follow a predetermined plan.
This will allow the central bank to be flexible and signal a faster QE
completion than is currently anticipated.

Monetary normalization is often described as hitting the brake, but in
reality, the Fed will not even touch the brake. High inflation keeps
real Treasury yields low and allows the stock market to rally up. Ahead
of the FOMC meeting, all three key stock indexes have broken through
all-time highs over three days in a row.

### Weekly [EURUSD][1] trading plan

I don’t think the Fed will sound hawkish. Otherwise, it could lead to
economic or financial stress. By informing [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s what they already
know and not providing any fresh information, the central bank will
encourage them to exit trades, including the [EURUSD][1] shorts. If the
price goes up above 1.161, one could consider entering purchases. If the
Fed manages to surprise the markets, it will be relevant to continue
selling the euro versus the US dollar with a target at 1.145.
