Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 03.11.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

The ETHUSD has started forming the final wave in the large triangle.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

The BTCUSD market is forming the final impulse wave (С) in the larger
correction [B]. Sub-waves 1-2-3 have been completed in the (С) wave, and
corrective wave 4 is currently developing as a double zigzag
[W]-[X]-[Y], which will soon be concluded by the final motive wave [Y].
The [Y] wave should end at a level of 56638.74, where wave [Y] will be
76.4% of the [W] wave.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Sell 62878.50, TP 56638.74

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

The XRPUSD market is forming the large linking wave X as a triple
zigzag, with the final motive wave [Z] unfolding inside. The [Z] must be
developing as a simple zigzag (A)-(B)-(C). There have completed the (A)
impulse and a zigzag-shaped correction (B). The bullish impulse wave (C)
is currently developing. The price should be moving up in the (C) wave
to a level of 1.226, the previous high marked by wave [Y].

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] **** today:

Buy 1.190, TP 1.226

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

The ETHUSD market is forming the long-term corrective wave B. The chart
displays the structure of the final wave [C], which is the element of
the larger correction. In the impulse wave [C], there is unfolding the
horizontal correction 4 as an expanding triangle. The upward zigzag-
shaped wave D seems to have completed, so the price could shortly start
declining in the final wave E of the triangle. The target is at the
support level and the previous low of 3882.00.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Sell 4552.13, TP 3882.00
