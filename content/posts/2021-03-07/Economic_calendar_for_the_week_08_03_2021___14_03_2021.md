Economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the week 08.03.2021 – 14.03.2021Jana Kane

##  **Review of the main events of the Forex economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the
next trading week (08.03.2021 – 14.03.2021)**

 **Trading on key Forex [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/): next week we are expecting the publication
of important macro statistics from Japan, the US, Germany, the Eurozone,
Canada, China, as well as the results of the meetings of the central
banks of Canada and the Eurozone.**

The sales of US government bonds continue, which contributes to the
growth of their yield, the decline in the US stock market and the
strengthening of the dollar.

Nevertheless, the major US stock indexes finished the past week in
different directions. While the industrial DJIA rose, the high-tech
NASDAQ fell, and the S&P 500 ended last week with a minimal gain only
thanks to a positive report on the US labor market, which exceeded
expectations. As the US Department of Labor reported on  Friday, non-
farm jobs rose 379,000 in February, while unemployment fell to 6.2% from
6.3% in January, beating forecasts of 210,000 and 6.3%, respectively.

Based on [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) data, it will take about two years before the Fed
returns to the issue of tightening monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). According to the
Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, full employment is characterized by
an unemployment rate of 4.4%.

And yet, the dollar rose last week (+1.3%) for the second week in a row,
receiving support from the growing yields of American bonds.

Probably, the dollar will continue to strengthen next week if the
situation on the US government bond market does not change. The Federal
Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, speaking on Thursday, said the Fed was
monitoring the rise in the US Treasury yields, but he did not give any
signals about any possible intervention from their side.

Next week, financial market participants will pay attention to the
publication of important macro statistics from Japan, the US, Germany,
Eurozone, Canada, and China. However, their focus will be on the
meetings of the central banks of Canada and the Eurozone.

 **Traders should pay attention to the publication of the following
macro indicators:**

 ***during the coming week, new events may be added to the [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) and
/ or some scheduled events may be canceled**

 ****GMT time**

###  **Monday, March 8**

###  **10:00 GBP Speech by the head of the Bank of England Andrew
Bailey**

In his speech, Andrew Bailey will likely touch on the state and
prospects of the British economy after Brexit, which has been badly hit
by the coronavirus pandemic.

Participants of financial markets will also expect him to clarify the
situation regarding the further [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the central bank of Great
Britain. If Andrew Bailey gives any hints of tightening or easing of the
Bank of England's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) in the near future, volatility during
his speech will sharply increase in the pound and the London Stock
Exchange FTSE index. If he still does not touch upon the issues of
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), the reaction to his speech will be weak.

As you know, at last month's meeting, the Bank of England decided to
leave interest rates and the size of the asset acquisition program
unchanged at 0.10% and 895 billion pounds, respectively, and presented
an optimistic economic outlook. Bank executives were also skeptical
about the imposition of negative interest rates, prompting a sharp
appreciation of the pound.

###  **23:50 JPY Japan GDP Q4 2020 (final estimate)**

GDP is considered an indicator of the general state of a country's
economy and estimates the rate of its growth or decline. The report on
gross domestic product published by the Cabinet of Ministers of Japan
expresses in monetary [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) the aggregate value of all final goods and
services produced by Japan over a certain period of time. An upward
trend in GDP is considered a positive factor for the national currency
(yen), while a low result is considered negative (or bearish).

In the previous 3rd quarter of 2020, the country's GDP grew by +3.0%
(+12.7% on an annualized basis) after falling in the first half of 2020.
The preliminary estimate expected GDP growth in the 4th quarter of 2020
by +3.0% or +12.7% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/).

The data points to continued recovery in Japan's economy after the
decline caused by the coronavirus pandemic.

If the data turns out to be weaker, the yen may strengthen against the
background of the fall in the Japanese stock market in the short term.
Better-than-expected data is likely to help the Japanese stock market
rally. However, it should also be noted that in recent weeks, financial
market participants pay little attention to [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) and weak macro
statistics, abandoning defensive assets, including the yen, in favor of
more risky and profitable stock market assets.

###  **Tuesday, March 9**

###  **10:00 EUR Eurozone GDP Q4 2020 (final estimate)**

GDP is considered to be an indicator of the overall health of the
economy. The upward trend in GDP is considered positive for the EUR; a
poor result weakens the EUR.

Recently, macro data from the Eurozone have been indicating a gradual
recovery in the growth rate of the European economy after a sharp drop
in early 2020. However, the decision made by the EU leaders in July to
provide additional support to the economy (a package of of 1.8 trillion
euros for the economic recovery of the bloc was approved) will help
stabilize the economy of the Eurozone, which is on the cusp of the
deepest economic downturn since World War II as a result of quarantine
restrictions, restraint in spending by companies and consumers, as well
as the collapse of exports.

The euro reacted positively to this decision.

However, according to economists' forecast, Eurozone GDP is expected to
fall by -0.6% in the 4th quarter of 2020 (down -5.0% on an annualized
basis) after rising 12.5% ​​(down -4.3% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) in the 3rd
quarter, falling by -11.8% (-14.7% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) in the second
quarter and falling by -3.6% (-3.1% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) in the 1st quarter
of 2020.

If the data turn out to be weaker than the preliminary estimate (-0.6%
and a decline of -5.0% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)), the euro may fall. Data better
than the first estimate may strengthen the euro in the short term,
although it is still far from the full recovery of the European economy
even to pre-crisis levels (quarterly growth within 0.2% - 0.4%).

###  **22:00 AUD Speech by the head of the RBA Philip Lowe**

In his speech, Philip Lowe will assess the current situation in the
Australian economy and probably lay out further plans for the monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the department. Any signals from him regarding a change in the
plans of the RBA's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) will cause a sharp increase in
volatility in the AUD and on the Australian stock market. If he does not
touch on the topic of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), the market reaction to his speech
will be weak.

Market participants would also like to hear Lowe's views on central bank
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and Australia's first
recession in 30 years.

In early November, the RBA's key interest rate was cut to a record level
of 0.1%, and the target level of yield on 3-year government bonds was
also lowered to 0.1%. The decision to lower the rate and set the current
target for government bond yields was made to support businesses and
Australian citizens amid the rapid spread of the coronavirus pandemic.

According to Lowe, "there are no serious arguments in favor of
tightening monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) in the short term," and "it will be some time
before interest rates rise."

###  **Wednesday, March 10**

###  **01:30** **CNY Consumer Price Index (** **CPI)**

The National Bureau of Statistics of China will release another monthly
report reflecting the dynamics of consumer prices in China. Rising
consumer prices could trigger an acceleration in inflation, which could
force the People's Bank of China to take measures aimed at tightening
fiscal [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). Increased growth in consumer inflation may cause
appreciation of the yuan, a weak result will put pressure on the yuan.

China's economy, according to various estimates, is already the largest
in the world, pushing the US economy into second place. Therefore, the
publication of important macroeconomic indicators of this country has a
significant impact on world financial markets, primarily on the
positions of the yuan, other Asian currencies, the dollar, commodity
currencies, as well as on Chinese and Asian stock indices. China is the
largest buyer of raw materials and a supplier of a wide range of
finished products to the world commodity market.

In January 2020, the growth of the consumer inflation index amounted to
+1.4% (+5.4% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)), and in May CPI decreased to -0.8% (+2.4%
in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)).

Deterioration of macroeconomic indicators, including a decrease in
consumer inflation, may negatively affect the positions of the yuan, as
well as commodity currencies such as the Canadian, Australian, and New
Zealand dollars. To a greater extent, this applies to the Australian
dollar, since China is Australia's largest trade and economic partner.

According to the forecast, Consumer Price Index is expected to grow by
+0.4% in February, but decrease by -0.4% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) against +1.0%
(-0.3%), +0.7% (+0.2%), -0.6% (-0.5%), -0.3% (-2.1%) and +0.2% (+1.7% in
annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) in previous months.

The growth of the consumer price index will positively affect the quotes
of the yuan, as well as commodity currencies, primarily the Australian
dollar. However, a relative decline in CPI may negatively affect them.

###  **12:30 USD Consumer price index (ex food and energy)**

Consumer Price Index (CPI) determines the change in prices of a selected
basket of goods and services for a given period and is a key indicator
for assessing inflation and changes in consumer preferences. Food and
energy have been excluded from this indicator to provide a more accurate
estimate. A high score strengthens the US dollar, while a low score
weakens it. In December 2020, the value of the indicator was +0.1%
(+1.6% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/), and in January 0% and +1.4%, respectively.
Forecast for February: +0.2% and +1.4 % (on an annualized basis), which
indicates some improvement in the situation after the index fell in
March and April 2020 amid the coronavirus pandemic. If the data for
February turns out to be weaker than forecast, the dollar is likely to
respond with a short-term decline. The better-than-forecast data will
strengthen the dollar .

###  **15:00 CAD Bank of Canada's decision on interest rate. Bank of
Canada's accompanying statement. Bank of Canada's Monetary Policy
Committee Report**

The Bank of Canada will decide on the interest rate. In March 2020, the
bank lowered the rate 3 times, bringing it to the level of 0.25% to
mitigate the economic damage from the novel coronavirus pandemic.

In an accompanying statement, the central bank of Canada said that the
decision "aims to support the financial system, which plays a central
role in lending to the economy, as well as to create a foundation that
will allow the economy to return to normal." The central bank's press
release also said the spread of the coronavirus and the plummeting
global oil prices are collectively weighing heavily on Canadians and the
Canadian economy.

In fact, quantitative easing and a significant cut in the interest rate
should contribute to the weakening of the national currency.

The impact of the coronavirus on the Canadian economy and the country's
labor market (in March 2020, unemployment rose to 7.8% from 5.6% in
February, and the number of employed, as reported by Statistics Canada,
fell by 1.01 million), and weakness in the housing market is also
putting pressure on the Bank of Canada to further ease monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).

However, the Bank of Canada is expected to keep its interest rate at
0.25% at its meeting on Wednesday.

Tough tone of the accompanying statement by the Bank of Canada on rising
inflation and the prospects for further tightening of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
will cause the Canadian dollar to strengthen. If the Bank of Canada
signals the need for soft monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), the Canadian currency will
decline.

###  **Thursday, March 11**

###  **12:45 EUR ECB decision on rates**

The ECB will publish its decision on the key rate and on the deposit
rate. The ECB's tough stance on inflation and key interest rates
contributes to the strengthening of the euro, while the soft stance and
rate cuts weaken the euro. In September 2019, the European Central Bank
lowered its key interest rate on deposits by 0.1%, to -0.5% for the
first time since March 2016 and began buying bonds worth 20 billion
euros a month, renewing the so-called quantitative easing program.
According to the ECB leaders, the balance of risks for the economic
prospects of the Eurozone "is still shifted to the negative side", and
"until inflation is in line" with the target level, which is just below
2%, the rate will remain low. Now inflation in the Eurozone is
stubbornly holding around 1%, and the new forecasts of the ECB on rates
and the QE program can be seen as a signal of the inclination to further
soften [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).

After Brexit, trade conflicts, factors of political instability in
Europe, as well as the growing coronavirus pandemic, due to which
European countries are forced to introduce new quarantine restrictions
that negatively affect economic activity, are the main threats to the
European economy. Back in March 2020, the ECB signaled the possibility
of [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) easing, and the bank's representative admitted that the bank's
management could lower the already negative interest rates even more.

Probably, following the results of this ECB meeting, the key interest
rate will remain at the same level of 0%. The ECB's rate on deposits for
commercial banks is also likely to remain at -0.5%. At the same time,
there is a possibility that at this meeting the ECB will announce a new
program to stimulate the economy, which will put pressure on the euro.

###  **13:30 EUR Press conference of the ECB**

During the press conference, a surge in volatility is possible not only
in the euro quotes, but also in the entire financial market, if the ECB
leaders make any unexpected statements. Similar previous decisions by
the ECB on interest rates and subsequent press conferences have moved
the euro rate by 3-5% in a short time. The ECB leaders will assess the
current economic situation in the Eurozone and comment on the ECB's rate
decision.

The soft tone of the statements will have a negative impact on the euro.
Conversely, a tough tone from ECB officials on central bank monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) will strengthen the euro.

###  **Friday, March 12**

###  **07:00 EUR Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) in Germany
(final release)**

This index is published by the EU Statistical Office and is calculated
on the basis of a statistical method agreed between all EU countries. It
is an indicator for assessing inflation and is used by the Governing
Council of the ECB to assess the level of price stability. A positive
result strengthens the EUR, a negative one weakens it.

In January, the HICP index (on an annualized basis) increased by +1.4%
(+1.6% on an annualized basis). The preliminary forecast for February
was: +0.7% and +1.6%, respectively. If the data turn out to be better
than the forecast and the first estimate, the euro may strengthen in the
short term. The growth of the indicator is a positive factor for the
euro. The data show that inflationary pressures are still low in
Germany. The data worse than the forecast and the previous value will
negatively affect the euro.

###  **13:30 CAD Unemployment rate in Canada**

Statistics Canada is to publish data on the country's labor market for
February.

Unemployment has risen in Canada in recent months, including amid
massive business closures due to coronavirus and layoffs. Unemployment
rose from the usual 5.6% - 5.7% to 7.8% in March and already up to 13.7%
in May 2020. If unemployment continues to rise, the Canadian dollar will
decline. If the data turn out to be better than the previous value, the
Canadian dollar will strengthen. A decrease in the unemployment rate is
a positive factor for the CAD, an increase in unemployment is a negative
factor. Unemployment is expected to be 9% in February (after 9.4% in
January, 8.6% in December, 8.5% in November, and 8.9%, 9.0%, 10.2%, 10 ,
9%, 12.3%, 13.7%, 13.0%, respectively, in previous months).

###  **15:00 USD University of Michigan Consumer Confidence Index
(preliminary release)**

This indicator reflects the confidence of American consumers in the
economic development of the country. A high level indicates economic
growth, while a low level indicates stagnation. Previous values ​​of the
indicator: 76.8 in February, 79.0 in January 2021. An increase in the
indicator will strengthen the USD, while a decrease in the value will
weaken the dollar. This indicator is expected to come out in March with
a value of 78.0. There is still a weak trend towards a gradual recovery
in the growth of the indicator. The data worse than the forecast may
negatively affect the dollar in the short term.
