Yen's position is getting worse. Forecast as of 16.06.2021Dmitri
Demidenko

While the US is recording unprecedented inflation levels in decades, the
Bank of Japan continues to fight deflation. This fact does not allow the
Japanese regulator to withdraw monetary stimulus and contributes to the
[USDJPY][1] growth. Let us discuss this question and make up a trading
plan.

## Weekly yen fundamental analysis

While the European car is making a huge effort to catch up with the
American one, the Japanese car is stuck on the turn. The difficult
epidemiological situation in Asia and the slow vaccination in Japan are
forcing Reuters experts to cut their GDP forecasts, and Japanese
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s to look for places to invest capital abroad. This contributes
to the yen weakening and explains some of the paradoxical processes in
the financial markets.

When [USDJPY][1] hit a year high in March, no one was surprised. At the
same time, there was a rally in Treasury yields, and [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s got rid
of bonds due to fears of inflation acceleration while the rate
differential on the 10-year US and Japanese debts was widening, the
analyzed pair was confidently rising. In April-May, against the
background of falling Treasury yields, USDJPY slipped into
consolidation, which also looked logical. But in June, US Treasury rates
fell and their correlation with [USDJPY][1] ended.

### Dynamics of [USDJPY][1] and US-Japan bond yield gap

The reason lies in the active purchases of Treasuries by Japanese
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s. The significantly depreciated dollar and the need to find
places for capital investment due to the slow recovery of the Japanese
economy increased the attractiveness of such operations. Slow
vaccinations and tense epidemiological situation are strong reasons for
lowering GDP forecasts. Reuters analytics expect that in the second
quarter the indicator will expand not by 1.7%, as previously expected,
but by 0.5% YoY. The Fed expects the US economy to grow by 6.5% in 2021,
while the ECB expects more than 4% growth in European GDP.

Japan's economic growth rate is low, so the country will probably
hesitate to regulate monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). While the officials of central
banks of Norway, Canada, and New Zealand, talk about normalization amid
accelerating inflation, and the Fed begins to discuss the QE tapering,
the Bank of Japan continues to address the problem of deflation.
According to 90% of economists polled by Reuters, the BoJ will make
adjustments to monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) no earlier than 2023. The remaining 10%
of respondents believe that this will happen a year later.

Divergence in economic growth, monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), and the associated
capital outflow from Japan, is an indication of the [USDJPY][1] uptrend
stability. I have long called the yen one of the main outsiders of
2021-2022 and I continue to adhere to this opinion. Nomura officials
think the same. They expect to see the dollar price at ¥112 and ¥115 by
the end of this and next year.

### Weekly [USDJPY][1] trading plan

The meetings of the Fed and the Bank of Japan will have a short-term
impact on the USDJPY dynamics. If the markets do not expect anything new
from Haruhiko Kuroda and his colleagues, then Jerome Powell must act
carefully so as not to scare [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s. In my opinion, it would be
profitable to hold and add up to [USDJPY][1] longs formed [earlier][2]
at the level of 109.2 in case of a breakout of the resistance at 110.4.
