Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 16.06.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

Oil price reached Target Zone 2 72.64 - 72.11.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

Oil price reached Target Zone 2 72.64 - 72.11. The short-term trend
remains up. If today the price closes above Target Zone 2 at the US
trading session, the next target for purchases will be Gold Zone 2 75.03
- 74.76.

If Target Zone 2 is held by sellers, then a correction will occur.
Correction for us is an opportunity to consider new purchases at
favorable prices. It is profitable to consider new purchases at strong
supports: Micro-zone, Additional Zone, and Intermediary Zone. The trend
border is at level 69.23.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

  1. Buy according to the pattern in Micro-zone 71.87 - 71.81. TakeProfit: 72.52. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. Buy according to the pattern in Additional Zone 71.21 - 71.08. TakeProfit: 72.52. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

Gold is trading in a short-term downtrend. On June 14 and 15, traders
tested the trend's key resistance 1869 - 1867. Yesterday, the zone was
held, and a sell pattern was formed. Today it is profitable to open
short trades according to the pattern with the target at the June 14th
low.

An alternative scenario: the breakout of the Intermediary Zone and price
consolidation higher will lead to a trend reversal up. In this case, buy
the gold with a target in the upper Target Zone 1894 - 1889.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

Sell according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 1869 - 1867.
TakeProfit: 1845. StopLoss: 1868.3.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

The euro is trading in a short-term downtrend. Yesterday, the traders
tested the Additional Zone 1.2141 - 1.2136 which serves as the strong
resistance. The zone was held, and a false breakout sell pattern was
formed. Today it is profitable to sell the euro according to the pattern
with the target at level 1.2096.

Buy the euro if the bulls break out level 1.2144. In this case, the
Additional Zone will also be broken out, and the price will move to the
next margin zone – Intermediary Zone 1.2189 - 1.2180.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

Sell according to the pattern in Additional Zone 1.2141 - 1.2136.
TakeProfit: 1.2096. StopLoss: 1.2146.
