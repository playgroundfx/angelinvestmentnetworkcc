Dollar is on a knife edge. Forecast as of 16.06.2021Dmitri Demidenko

The Fed's dual mandate sets a difficult task. Inflation is soaring while
the labor market is recovering slower than the economy. And this is not
the only imbalance. How does the imbalance affect the [EURUSD][1]? Let
us discuss the Forex outlook and make up a trading plan.

## US dollar fundamental forecast for today

Fed’s June meeting will be like walking on a knife edge. If the central
bank does too little, US inflation will continue accelerating. If he
does too much, the US economy will slide into a financial crisis and
recession. Investors are nervous ahead of the important event. After a
drop at the end of last week, the [EURUSD][2] is trading around the
bottom of figure 21.

According to 63% of 224 asset managers with $667 billion assets surveyed
by BofA Merrill Lynch, the Fed will signal to taper the QE in September.
However, the Federal Reserve's so-called dot plot could give a clue in
early summer. In March, 11 out of 18 FOMC officials predicted a federal
funds rate hike in 2024, but successful vaccinations and surging US GDP
increase the chance of shifting the date X to 2023.

### March forecasts for federal funds rate

Fed is challenged now. If the forecast suggests an earlier start of
monetary normalization, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s will think that the central bank is
frightened by inflation and will resort to monetary restrictions sooner
than is currently expected. If the consensus forecast remains unchanged,
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s will believe that Jerome Powell and his colleagues are willing
to put up with high inflation. What should the Fed do amid significant
imbalances in the US economy? Demand is growing much faster than supply,
causing inflationary pressures. The labor market is recovering more
slowly than the GDP. Investors were also puzzled by the release of data
on retail sales and producer prices. The first indicator dipped by 1.3%,
the second - increased by 0.8%, with an average monthly increase of 0.2%
in 2017-2019.

The list of imbalances does not end there. The widening twin deficit has
been an important driver for the USD for a long time. It has been
presumed that US imports exceed domestic production. Therefore, there is
the foreign trade deficit, which should be compensated by the capital
inflows into the USA. As long as the US is the world leader in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of
vaccination rates and its economy is growing by leaps and bounds, this
does not pose much of a problem for the dollar. But as soon as the rest
of the world begins to catch up with the USA, as it was in 2014,
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s will be selling off the greenback.

According to Goldman Sachs, the combination of the steady global
economic recovery and the Fed’s slow monetary normalization will further
weaken the US dollar. In this case, the major beneficiary will be the
euro. BofA Merrill Lynch believes that the further [EURUSD][2] trend
will depend on whether the Fed was right about the temporary nature of
the inflation surge. In the bank’s survey, 72% believe that the central
bank is correct, but what if there is a mistake? Massive closing of the
positions could trigger the crash of the stock indexes and strengthen
the dollar. Based on the forecast for the euro at $1.15 at the end of
the year, BofA Merrill Lynch believes it is a likely scenario.

### [EURUSD][2] trading plan for today

The Fed is challenged with a hard task. If the US central bank succeeds,
the [EURUSD][2] will go back above 1.22. Place your bets, ladies and
gentlemen!
