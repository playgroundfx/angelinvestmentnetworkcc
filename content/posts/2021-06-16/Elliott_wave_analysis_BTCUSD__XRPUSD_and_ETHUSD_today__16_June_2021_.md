Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 16.06.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

Bitcoin is expected to go down a little in a shallow correction; next,
the price will resume rising in the final impulse.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

The BTCUSD market is forming a corrective wave [2] as a regular zigzag
(A)-(B)-(C), with a deep corrective wave (B). Wave (B) is a double
zigzag W-X-Y. There is now unfolding the upward wave (C) as a simple
five-wave impulse 1-2-3-4-5. The price could go down a little in
correction 4. Next, the market will resume rising in the final wave 5,
as it is outlined in the chart. The entire correction [2] may finish at
a level around 44500.00, where wave [2] will retrace wave [1] by 50%.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 39958.4, TP 44500.0

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

There is developing the linking wave (X), which is an element of the
double zigzag. Wave (X) could be a double zigzag W-X-Y. The final leg of
this double zigzag should also be a double combination. Therefore, there
should be unfolding an upward zigzag (A)-(B)-(C), which will make up the
final motive wave [Y], as it is outlined in the chart. The linking wave
(X) could end at a level of 1.202. At this level, wave [Y] will reach
the 38.2% Fibonacci level of wave (W).

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] today:

Buy 0.862, TP 1.202

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

The ETHUSD market continues forming corrective wave 2, which is
unfolding as a standard zigzag [A]-[B]-[C]. The impulse upwave [A] has
completed. Corrective wave [B] has also completed, it is composed of the
sub-waves (W)-(X)-(Y). There is developing the upward wave (C) as an
ending diagonal. There should be forming the final wave (5), which could
finish at a level of 2845.00. It is the previous high where correction
[B] ended.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Buy 2519.18, TP 2845.00
