USDJPY: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 30.10.2020 –
06.11.2020Alex Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 106.10 with a target of 102.50 – 100.87.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
106.10 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 108.07 –
109.81.

 **Analysis:** Daily time frame: presumably, a correction of larger
degree is completed in the form of wave (B). Wave (С) has started to
form, with the third wave 3 of (C) developing inside. H4 time frame: the
third wave of smaller degree iii of 3 is developing, with local
correction (ii) of iii formed inside. H1 time frame: apparently, wave
(iii) of iii of 3 is developing at the moment. If this assumption is
correct, the pair will continue to fall to 102.50 – 100.87. The level of
106.10 is critical in this scenario as the breakout will enable the pair
to continue growing to the levels of 108.07 – 109.81
