USDCHF: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 30.10.2020 -
06.11.2020Alex Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions from corrections above the
level of 00.9030 with a target of 0.9295 – 0.9468.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
0.9030 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of 0.8900
– 0.8800.

 **Analysis:** The descending third wave of larger degree (3) presumably
continues developing on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame, with wave 1 of (3) formed
inside. A local correction is developing as wave 2 of (3) on the H4 time
frame, with waves a of 2 and b of 2 formed inside. Apparently, wave c of
2 is developing on the H1 time frame. If this assumption is correct, the
pair will continue to rise to 0.9295 – 0.9468. The level of 0.9030 is
critical in this scenario. Its breakout will allow the pair to continue
falling to the levels of 0.8900 – 0.8800.
