Euro: practice makes perfect. Analysis as of 30.10.2020Dmitri Demidenko

Christine Lagarde’s dovish rhetoric only speeded up the euro’s collapse.
Investors are worried the S&P 500 and [EURUSD][1] may fall again like it
was in March. Let’s discuss that and make a trading plan.

## Monthly fundamental forecast for the euro

Fear is ruling the market and [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) repeats itself. These two
principles explain the best the [EURUSD][1]’s fall in four consecutive
trading sessions. The pair’s quotes dropped to two-month lows, while
their collapse on 29 October became the worst since 21 September.
Investors may blame good statistics on the US’ Q3 GDP and the ECB’s
hints about a monetary stimulus expansion. However, we know the market
has expected that, and therefore, we need to find some other reasons.

Never before has the European Central bank expressed its intention to
soften monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) so clearly. At a press conference, Christine
Lagarde said that the Executive Board would undoubtedly approve of a new
stimulus in December since the second wave and lockdown threatened the
EU economy with a double recession. The GDP’s recovery isn’t as fast as
expected and monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) should therefore be corrected. The ECB took
action during the first coronavirus wave, and it will do so during the
second one.

The hint is transparent. The forward market is pointing to the ECB’s
rate cut. However, all this was predictable: both the €500 billion QE
extension in December and the pandemic’s negative impact on the
economy’s recovery. At the same time, a softer monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) won’t be
a relief in the circumstances where banks phase out crediting amid
growing bad debt. According to Citigroup’s research, the European bank
will buy up €460 billion in bonds in 2021, which will be more than the
eurozone’s net asset issuance value of €405 billion. Investors’ fight
for bonds will be harsh, which will raise demand for the euro and boost
the [EURUSD][1]’s growth.

The US’ Q3 GDP grew 33.1%, hence the euro’s fall suspension. The upbeat
statistics slowed down stock indexes’ slump for a while. Thus, the [S&P
500][2] didn’t update its September’s low and the [EURUSD][1]’s bulls
got an advantage.

Investors are much concerned about a record-high increase in new Covid
cases in the USA and severe restrictions in Germany, France, and other
European countries. They don’t exclude the US stock market’s collapse,
similar to March’s. On the one hand, fear grows as the eurozone’s
switched faster to a new lockdown and hence a chance of fewer losses. On
the other hand, this fact allows counting on the EURUSD’s recovery like
it was in July-August.

### Monthly trading plan for [ **EURUSD**][1]

Thus, the market forgot about the US election and focused on the
pandemic. If the [S&P 500][2] manages to correct, the [EURUSD][1]’s fall
to 1.155 and 1.14 should be bought up. On the contrary, the euro will
claw back losses faster if US stock market bulls manage to counter-
attack amid Joe Biden’s victory and vaccine [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/). However, the euro’s
fans need to bring quotes back above 1.173 first.
