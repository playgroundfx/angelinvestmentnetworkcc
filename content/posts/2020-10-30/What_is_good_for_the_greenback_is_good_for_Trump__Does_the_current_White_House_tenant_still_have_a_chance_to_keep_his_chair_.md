Dollar's farewell performance. Review as of 30.10.2020Dmitri Demidenko

What is good for the greenback is good for Trump. Does the current White
House tenant have a chance to keep his chair?

## Can the USD index's rise right before the election be a tribute to
retiring Trump?

Those Americans are so strange: less than a week is left, and they still
don't know who will be the president! Financial markets appear not to
understand that either. The [S&P 500's][1] fall on the eve of the
election indicates that the party in power's candidate will lose. The
ratings indicate the same, but the US dollar is growing by leaps and
bounds, while [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s know: what is good for the greenback is good for
Donald Trump. Can the Republican still have a chance? Or is it the USD's
farewell performance for Trump?

Even if we forget about the pandemic and trade wars, we'll see that a
weak dollar has run all through Trump's presidency. The US' 45th
president did his best to weaken the greenback, accusing China and
Europe of manipulating their currencies, asking the Fed to cut rates and
revive QE, and calling Jerome Powell the USA's main enemy.

In the end, things didn't go the way Trump wanted. The USD index was
consolidating stably from the beginning of 2018 and up to May 2020. The
strong economy helped the Fed raise rates several times, which other
central banks couldn't afford. Tax cuts and de[regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/) became a boon
for US companies and the whole stock market. That drove capital to the
USA and strengthened the dollar. The trading war slowed global trading
down, cut the euro's rate, and boosted demand for safe-haven assets. The
greenback won all the same.

The US' 45th president will enter [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) books as a man who spoiled
everything and as a man who first speaks and then thinks. His attempts
to describe things better than they are make everybody smile and make
him lose his authority. Trust is like paper: once creased, it's hard to
smooth it out. Trump called the US' Q3 GDP growth "best in [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/)" and
said the year 2021 would be fantastic. However, Sleepy Biden's tax hike
may "kill it all"! In fact, the US economy is now 3.5% worse than at the
beginning of 2019. To get back to the previous figures, it needs to
expand 15% in Q4, which is practically impossible. The current president
is to be blamed for that too, as anti-pandemic measures weren't taken in
good time. People say a clever man admits his faults, a cunning man
blames others, and a stupid man is proud of them. Sounds true.

The key-note of Donald Trump's presidency was looking for a scapegoat.
It was either China or Jerome Powell. The president's opponents would
keep silent, understanding what consequences return criticism may have.
Joe Biden won't keep silent. He says recovery is slowing down or even
standing still, while the current high GDP value doesn't help millions
of ordinary Americans who have lost their jobs.

What frightens me the most is that the new US president is neither Trump
nor Biden...but Alzheimer!
