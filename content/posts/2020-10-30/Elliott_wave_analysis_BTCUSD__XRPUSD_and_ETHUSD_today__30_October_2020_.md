Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 30.10.2020Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I suggest entry signals
to trade each cryptocurrency.

After a slight decline, the BTCUSD price will continue to rise within
the impulse wave [5].

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

The zigzag-like linking wave [X] is developing. At the end of September
2020, a flat corrective wave B was built, which took the shape of a
contracting triangle [A]-[B]-[C]-[D]-[E]. This was followed by a bullish
impulse C, consisting of sub-waves [1]-[2]-[3]-[4]-[5]. Most likely, the
final impulse wave (c) of the corrective wave [4] is developing,
therefore, after it is completed, wave [5] is expected to rise to the
level of 15200.00.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 13571.25, TP 15200.00

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

 ****

The downward zigzag A-B-C is developing on the XRPUSD chart, where wave
A is a bearish impulse, which was completed at the end of September
2020. Wave B is a triple zigzag correction that is still developing. The
final wave [Z] is developing, it is a double zigzag. Possibly, the
downward linking wave (x) has come been completed. In the coming trading
days, wave (y) could rise to the level of 0.273.

### Trading plan for **[XRPUSD][2]** today:

Buy 0.242, TP 0.273

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

After the downward impulse wave A was completed in early September this
year, we saw the corrective wave B developing, it looks like a double
zigzag [W]-[X]-[Y]. The first two parts of this zigzag are fully
completed, and now the final zigzag [Y] is developing, it consists of
sub-waves (A)-(B)-(C). As part of the impulse wave (C), the correction
[4], which is a triple zigzag, has been completed. At the moment we see
the first part of wave [5] which is expected to rise to the level of
443.00.

### Trading plan for  **[ETHUSD][3] **today:

Buy 386.64, TP 443.00
