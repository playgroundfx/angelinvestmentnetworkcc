EURUSD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 30.10.2020 –
06.11.2020Alex Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 1.1838 with a target of 1.1526 – 1.1375.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
1.1838 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 1.2019 –
1.2100.

 **Analysis:** Daily time frame: presumably, the first wave 1 formed
inside the third wave (3) of larger degree. On the H4 time frame, a
local correction 2 of (3) is developing as second wave 2 of (3), with
wave c of 2 forming inside. Apparently, the third wave of smaller degree
(iii) of c is developing on the H1 time frame. If this assumption is
correct, the pair will continue to fall to 1.1526 – 1.1375. The level of
1.1838 is critical in this scenario. Its breakout will allow the pair to
continue rising to the levels of 1.2019 – 1.2100.
