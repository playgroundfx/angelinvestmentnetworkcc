Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 12.04.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

Ripple continues rising to a higher level than earlier expected.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

There is now should be unfolding the fifth wave of the global impulse as
an ending diagonal [1]-[2]-[3]-[4]-[5]. The price is now rising in the
corrective wave [3], which is developing as a regular zigzag
(A)-(B)-(C). Wave (A) is an impulse; correction (B) is a double zigzag;
wave (C) is also an impulse 1-2-3-4-5, still unfolding. The market must
have completed the sideways triangle correction 4, so the price should
be rising in wave 5 of a smaller degree to a level of 63350.00. One
could enter purchases in the current situation.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 59795.50, TP 63350.00

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

It is clear from the eight-hour XRPUSD price chart that corrective wave
B has completed as a triple zigzag. Next, the market has started forming
the bullish impulse [1]-[2]-[3]-[4]-[5]. Corrective wave 4 has recently
completed as a triangle; next, the price has moved sharply in wave [5].
There could be developing wave (3), which should be followed by a short
correction (4) as outlined in the chart. In the current situation, one
could enter long positions with a target at 1.730.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] today:

## Elliott wave Ethereum analysis

The ETHUSD price is rising in impulse wave C, namely, in its final leg.
There is now forming the upward impulse wave (5). The first four legs of
wave (5) look complete. There is now unfolding bullish wave 5 as an
impulse. The market could have finished forming a short triangle
correction [4], so the price should be rising in wave [5] of a smaller
degree to a level of 2300.00. One could enter buy trades in the current
situation.
