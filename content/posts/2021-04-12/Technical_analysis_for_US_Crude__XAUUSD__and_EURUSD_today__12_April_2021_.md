Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 12.04.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

The oil short-term downtrend continues.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

The short-term oil downtrend continues. Its first target is the test of
the support level of 58.00, and the second - the test of level 57.35.
Hold sales entered last week.

If the bulls take control of the situation and break out the resistance
level of 60.70, then the short-term trend will reverse up. In this case,
enter oil purchases with the target in the upper Target Zone 63.26 -
62.75.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

Hold down sales entered in the zone of 59.42 - 60.45. TakeProfit: 57.35.
StopLoss: 61.00

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

Last Friday, gold traders could not break out the resistance Gold Zone
1755 - 1752. As a result, a correction began, within which the trend key
support 1733 - 1731 was reached. The price didn't break out the key
support and the technical level of 1734, so the probability of the gold
growth remains. The growth target will be last week's high.

It will be possible to consider gold sales only after the uptrend
reversal. To do this, the bears need to get things under control and
break out the trend key support 1733 - 1731.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

Hold up purchases entered in the zone of 1736 - 1731. TakeProfit: Zone
1757 - 1755. StopLoss: 1726.3.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

The euro is trading in a short-term uptrend. The growth target is the
Gold Zone 1.1952 - 1.1944.

Last week the price corrected to the Additional Zone 1.1887 - 1.1883.
The bears tried to break out the level but failed. As a result, the
price didn't break out the support. Look for or hold purchases in the
abovementioned support level. A breakout of the resistance level 1.1907
is required to form a buy pattern.

It will be relevant to sell the euro if the price breaks out level
1.1862. In this case, a false breakout pattern will be formed in the H1
chart.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

  1. Hold up purchases entered in the zone of 1.1883 - 1.1862. TakeProfit: 1.1921. StopLoss: 1.1857.

  2. Buy according to the pattern in Additional Zone 1.1887 - 1.1883. TakeProfit: 1.1921, Gold Zone 1.1952 - 1.1944. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.
