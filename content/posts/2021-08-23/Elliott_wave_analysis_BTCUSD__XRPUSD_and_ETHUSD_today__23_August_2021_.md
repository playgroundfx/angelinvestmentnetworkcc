Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 23.08.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

The three cryptocurrency pairs are developing the final parts of bullish
sub-waves. Bitcoin and Ethereum are forming impulses, and Ripple is
forming an ending diagonal.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

The BTCUSD market is moving up in the impulse wave (C), the final leg of
the bullish correction [B]. Sub-waves 1-2-3-4 have completed in the (C)
wave, and sub-wave 5 is still developing; sub-wave [5], which is about
to end soon, will conclude wave [5]. The market should reach level
51100.00. One could enter purchases.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 50245.50, TP 51100.00

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

The XRPUSD is forming the upward impulse wave C, which is the final leg
in the zigzag-shaped linking wave (X). Wave C is composed of five sub-
waves [1]-[2]-[3]-[4]-[5]. In early August, the market went down in the
zigzag-shaped correction [4]; next, the price started rising. There must
be forming bullish impulse wave [5]. The final sub-wave (5) of [5] looks
like an ending diagonal, as the bearish wave 4 finished lower than wave
1. The Ripple price should be rising in sub-wave 5 to a level of 1.4020.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] **** today:

Buy 1.248, TP 1.402

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

The ETHUSD market is rising in the bullish impulse wave. There have
completed sub-waves (1)-(2)-(3)-(4). Wave (5) is developing as an
impulse 1-2-3-4-5. There must be developing the final leg of this
impulse, sub-wave 5. The Ethereum price could go up to a level of
3670.00. One could consider entering buy trades with the target at
3670.00.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Buy 3338.23, TP 3670.00
