Gold fate depends on Jackson Hole. Forecast as of 23.08.2021Dmitri
Demidenko

The second change in the Fed's outlook in the last 2.5 months will be a
blow to the USD bulls, but will return interest in gold. It won't be
long to wait. A meeting at Jackson Hole will clarify the situation. Let
us discuss the Forex outlook and make up a gold trading plan

## Fundamental gold forecast for a week

Doubts. This is the keyword that has always supported gold. In fact,
precious metal is a useless asset. It does not protect against
inflation, as is commonly believed. This is proved by the fall of
[XAUUSD][1] during the acceleration of US consumer prices to multi-year
highs. During times of turmoil, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are more likely to choose the
greenback, while gold acts as an anti-dollar, so it falls. It's another
matter when the markets start to doubt. Will the Delta variant slow down
the US economy? Will the Fed abandon its plans to normalize monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) because of this? The answers to these questions are extremely
important for both the USD index and the precious metal.

The gold price usually drops sharply if the US dollar and Treasury
yields rise. In 2021, Treasury bond rates are stubbornly unwilling to go
up. Investors doubt that the QE tapering will break the Treasuries
uptrend. First, the Fed will continue to reinvest income, which will
allow the central bank's balance sheet to consolidate above $8 trillion.
Secondly, the demand for Treasuries from foreign [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s is off the
charts. According to the Ministry of Finance, the number of these
securities in the hands of foreign [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s in the first half of the
year increased by $134.1 billion. Thirdly, there is a lot of liquidity
in the system, so that the slightest corrections lead to bond purchases.

Gold was seriously shocked in early August as a strong US employment
report increased the risks of the Fed's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) normalization.
However, the central bank has always had reasons not to rush into
monetary restrictions before. There had been cold weather, contributing
to a slowdown in the US economy, then the government shutdown due to the
debt ceiling, or the tense international situation. Why wouldn't
COVID-19 become such a reason in 2021?

The second change in the Fed's outlook in the last 2.5 months is a
serious blow to the greenback. The first sign was the speech of the
President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, Robert Kaplan. He
announced his readiness to abandon his previous position on reducing the
scale of QE as early as 2021 if Delta slows the economy. If other FOMC
members follow the path of the former hawk, the USD longs will begin to
decline.

### Dynamics of major currencies' longs

In this regard, the Jackson Hole meeting of central bankers could take
on new meaning. Earlier, the Fed chairmen either said something amazing
to the market, or their speeches were completely missed by [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s. In
2021, the majority believed that Jerome Powell would not be able to stun
the financial markets. Because a QE tapering requires at least one more
strong employment report.

### Weekly gold trading plan

In fact, the change of the Fed head's position in relation to the Delta
will be fundamentally important. Powell recently said the Fed is
watching the pandemic, but the economy has adapted to COVID-19. If
Powell seems scared to [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s, gold risks soaring to $1825 and $1845
per ounce. Optimism, on the other hand, will contribute to another big
XAU downturn.
