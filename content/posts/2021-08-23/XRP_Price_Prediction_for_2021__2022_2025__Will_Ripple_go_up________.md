XRP Price Predictions & Ripple forecast: 2021 and BeyondJana Kane

Ripple XRP is one of the world's foremost cryptos - and one of the most
intriguing. Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other big names, it does not
market itself with its decentralization. Instead, the crypto is closely
associated with several banks, investment companies, and organizations
worldwide.

This may seem counterproductive when many traders believe that the
biggest selling point of cryptocurrencies is their freedom of influence
from outside companies. However, crypto experts are increasingly arguing
that it could be the key to Ripple's success.

At the end of 2020, the company faced an SEC lawsuit that put the Ripple
future under threat. Making a Ripple price prediction has become
challenging for experts and common [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s. Why is Ripple going up and
down? How high will Ripple go? Let's find out!

The article covers the following subjects:

## What Is Ripple Crypto and the History of XRP?

Ripple or XRP: are they synonyms or different [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)? If you are new to
the crypto market, you may have such questions in your mind. Thus, we
will start our price guide with basic [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/). It will allow you to
differentiate Ripple's products.

In order for traders to understand Ripple price predictions, it is
important to know what Ripple XRP is and why it differs from most other
cryptos on the market.

Put simply, Ripple is a company that provides a payment protocol that
can be compared to a payment system, money transfer network, and
currency exchange. The protocol works with digital currencies, fiat
money, and commodities. XRP is the protocol's internal coin.

If you want to have a deeper understanding of the Ripple topic, check
the following [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/).

  * XRP or Ripple is a cryptocurrency that’s powered by RippleNet. Financial institutions use the coin to provide fast transactions with low fees. 

  * RippleNet represents a payment platform. It's based on the distributed ledger database of XRP Ledger. Ripple operates the digital platform. RippleNet Cloud is used to deal with payments with one integration and a common Ripple Payment Object among RippleNet’s customers. It allows for “less friction and more standardization when customers are ready to scale.” 

  * As for the XRP Ledger, it's open-source and is based on the ledger database, not [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/).

Ripple's all time high price reached 3.37 USD on 7 January 2018.

### A Crash Course on Ripple XRP

Ryan Fugger was the first person who announced the idea of Ripple. It
was in 2004. However, the protocol's real [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) started only in 2012
when Jed McCaleb and Chris Larson took over the project. That time it
was not even Ripple but OpenCoin. The platform is actually called
RippleNet, while the crypto token is Ripple XRP. (It is usually listed
as XRP on exchanges).

First, it was a startup project from San Francisco; the [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/)-like
payment system was developed. It was created as an alternative to money
transfers for the banking system, not as an opposition. Its popularity
among financial institutions grew fast, and soon the company announced
interest from leading banks. It was expected as the system enforced low-
fee fast transfers all around the world.

Most altcoins that have entered the market are designed to solve some
problems that the founders believed could ultimately limit the success
of Bitcoin, the so-called king of cryptocurrency. Many, like Bitcoin
Cash, have focused on Bitcoin's lack of scalability. However, Ripple
focused on another feature of crypto: its decentralization.

Rather than providing a way for merchants and [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s to make
transactions online without going through a centralized financial
institution (which can be slow, potentially unsafe, and expensive),
Ripple was designed to make it easier for centralized financial
institutions to make payments. Cross-border payments can be even slower
than domestic payments, and they come with much higher transaction costs
- and companies worldwide can make hundreds of these transactions every
day.

To avoid skyrocketing transaction fees and unfavorable exchange rates,
Ripple allows companies to send and receive payments in Ripple XRP. It
offers a globalized currency that bypasses some of the problems that can
plague fiat currency and fully decentralized cryptos.

Banks apply the protocol to make cross-border transfers in real-time
using the xCurrent software solution. At the same time, Ripple (XRP) is
also available for [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s and traders. Traders can do operations with
the cryptocurrency via trading on crypto exchanges or with the help of
brokers. The company has had [contact](https://www.playgroundfx.com/contact/)s at the [highest political and
financial levels][1] for many years. Think of the World Bank, the ECB,
the IMF, and the World Economic Forum. With rave recommendations and
being priced from all sides – what could go wrong?

## What Happened to XRP in 2020 and 2021?

Before we list experts' opinions regarding XRP price forecasts and
Ripple's future, let's look at the price [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) that will uncover
plenty of vital things for any [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/). First, you will see what
affects the current price of XRP and in what way. And, you will catch
the current market conditions to be in the market.

During 2020, the [XRP market price][2] was relatively stable with
several medium-term bullish and bearish trends. After the upward
movement at the beginning of the year, the price was declining for a
month, from February to March. The next bullish trend occurred in July
but finished in less than a month. The main rise happened in November
when the price hit a maximum of $0.79.

Why is Ripple going up or down? If you think that something specific is
hidden behind these price movements, it's a mistake. The major Ripple
trends are positively correlated with BTC movements, so even Bitcoin
halving can affect the XRP price. The cryptocurrency repeats the trend
of the primary market.

Still, there were some certain events we should mention. Investors'
sentiments determine the price direction of any asset. Ripple
supply/demand factor plays a huge role. In April 2020, the co-founder of
Ripple Jed McCaleb sold 54 million Ripples. It's not a surprise that the
price moved down after the event became public.

New agreements with leading banks are one of the main drivers of XRP's
price. For example, in August, India's largest bank HDFC Bank Limited
joined RippleNet, in November, the second American largest bank, the
Bank of America, signed an agreement with Ripple.

In December, such leading US exchanges as Coinbase and Binance claimed
support for the upcoming airdrop of Spark tokens by Flare Networks. The
Flare airdrop took place, and 45 billion Spark tokens were distributed
among the XRP holders. The XRP price increased on the [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/); however, it
was corrected shortly.

Such events have short-term market effects that aren’t visible on high
timeframes.

Well, we have come to the most significant event that is still affecting
Ripple. The SEC, the US stock market watchdog, is challenging [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/)
company Ripple Inc. in court, along with its two top figures, CEO Brad
Garlinghouse and founder Christian Larsen. The [regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/)s in the US are
tough. The Securities and Exchange Commission's accusation is that
unregistered securities worth [$1.3 billion were sold in 2013][3]. It is
an old case hanging over Ripple for as long as we can remember. Ripple
has always maintained that the digital currency is a currency instead of
a security. Because otherwise, they'd have to comply with a lot of
different rules according to American law. Many are amazed that the US
apparently wants to slaughter the goose that lays the golden eggs.

In two days, from December 22 to 23, 2020, the XRP rate dropped from
approximately $0.50 to just under $0.30. From third place as the most
important cryptocurrency, the coin moved to fourth place, behind
stablecoin Tether.

XRP started the year at lows. Only on January 30th did the
cryptocurrency break above $0.40. After the breakthrough, XRP was
trading within a narrow $0.40-0.60 range from the end of January to
April 4th. The strong uptrend started on April 5th and lasted until
April 14th, when the price reached $1.80 (the high of January 2018). The
surge was caused by two court rulings in favor of XRP. As a result,
within 1.5 weeks, Ripple became the fourth most popular cryptocurrency
vs. the seventh place held before the rally started.

Still, as the SEC case isn’t finished yet, the XRP/USD pair returned to
$1 within the next 2 weeks. From the end of April to the end of May, the
price was highly volatile. Trying to hit $1.65, it returned to the lows
of $0.77. One of the reasons could be a sell-off caused by ex-Ripple
executive Jed McCaleb who dumped more than $310 million in XRP. The
downtrend continued until the middle of July when the price was trading
slightly above $0.60.

Ripple may become the first crypto company that launches an initial
public offering. The event may take place as soon as the SEC lawsuit is
solved. Although the announcement didn’t cause increased price
volatility, the case may become interesting for crypto [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s.

## XRP Price Prediction for 2021 by Crypto Experts

The SEC case hasn't been solved yet. And if, before, it had a dramatic
effect on the XRP price, now, the situation is not so obvious. At the
end of 2020, the XRP price fell to a local minimum of $0.17 while the
SEC case was gaining momentum. At the beginning of April 2021, the XRP
value renewed its three-year high at $1.11 while the court allowed the
company to review the internal documents of the SEC.

On May 4, Ripple plunged as the SEC threatened XRP holders with legal
action. The Commission opposes [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s to join the XRP securities
recognition case. Nevertheless, the fall didn't continue for long, as
the company appointed a former US treasurer to its board.

How should [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s behave in such uncertain circumstances? Is Ripple
expected to rise or fall? Look at experts' predictions.

TradingBeasts expects the average [XRP][2] price to stay within a
$0.82-0.85 range. The [website](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/website-for-forex-trading/) sees an uptrend, which is a good sign for
traders. Still, the rise will be limited. The maximum price will reach
$1.067 in December 2021. The minimum price won't fall below $0.7039
(August 2021). The XRP outlook was significantly reviewed by the
[website](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/website-for-forex-trading/). Previously, the maximum value was expected to move above $2.20.

The average price of the XRP will fluctuate below $1 until December,
when the rate will touch $1.075. Although the [website](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/website-for-forex-trading/) doesn't predict a
strong uptrend, the average price stays at good levels. The highest
price will already break above $1 in September. The minimum rate won't
fall below $0.30. However, the difference between the low and high price
signals increased volatility.

The Ripple forecast of Crypto Ground can't be called promising. Still,
the upward movement will prevail. By 2022, the price will reach $1.008.

This [website](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/website-for-forex-trading/) also projects an uptrend for the XRP/USD pair. According to
Coin Price Forecast, the price may reach $0.83 by the end of the year.
The forecast was reviewed. Just recently the platform expected XRP to
skyrocket to $5.

Below, you can check the Ripple coin price prediction by the Economy
Forecast Agency. The source expects a downtrend. The price of the
XRP/USD pair will suffer ups and downs. At the end of the year, the
price will close at $0.45.

## Ripple Technical Analysis

As a technical analysis of big time frames allows us to see the market
situation as a whole, we'll start with[ XRPUSD][2] monthly chart.



As shown in the picture above, the chart almost reproduced Ripple's
price [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) in 2018, and steep growth in April 2021 came before as
fast a fall in May-June 2021. Based on XRP price [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/), we can presume
that Ripple's projected value may hold steady at 0.786 Fibonacci of
April's peak, which equals 0.50 USD.

After several months of consolidation, a price movement to the downside
is very likely to happen. A projected fall may unfold down to the growth
bottom at 0.20 US dollars.

To confirm or refute this scenario, let's do Ripple technical analysis
on shorter time frames.

### Ripple price prediction for three months

Let's take a look at XRPUSD weekly price chart.

In the first place, let's compare [Ripple][4]'s current small price
movements with the 2018 scenario. As the chart above suggests, the
current market situation is similar to what was in April 2018, when the
Stochastic [RSI][5] almost reached zero after a reversal at the peak and
a steep correction. Now the situation repeats itself. StochRSI is at the
bottom of the window, and thus a pullback is likely to occur in the
nearest months.

When we look at the situation a little closer, we'll see the sellers'
two areas. The first one is at the peak, at around 2 USD. The other one
is near 1 USD. Those levels are marked with green lines in the chart.

Projected pullbacks are unlikely to break out those levels. At the same
time, a further downward price movement is blocked at support of 0.5
USD, the red line in the price chart above.

Examining the current price movement in the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) chart, we see bullish
counter-volumes. Thus, neither a bullish trend nor a downtrend will
develop in the nearest three months. The Ripple price is blocked in the
range of 0.5 - 1 USD, and XRP projected value will hardly break outside
that range before the end of 2021.

### Ripple price forecast for 2021

Here's a realistic Ripple forecast for the end of 2021.

The price is consolidating in the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) chart above. [Ripple][2]'s
expected trading range isn't likely to break through the current limits
of [[Bollinger Bands](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/bollinger-bands.html)][6]. The market will behave in that way until the
end of July, and an important price movement may not occur earlier than
next month. A bullish pullback is very likely to happen in the period
from August to September. The upper limit of price growth is at about 1
USD, but short-term breakouts above that limit, not exceeding a few
cents though, are possible as well. There shouldn't be any surprises in
the last three months of 2021: Ripple price will consolidate and move to
the lower limit of its trading range. Ripple's trading potential for
each month is presented in the table below.

#### Long-term trading plan for Ripple

A trading plan based on the above scenario may look like the following:

Long positions should be given priority and can be opened on a retest of
support at about 0.50 USD and on a breakout of the level of 0.75 USD
after the end of local consolidation. In both cases, a stop-loss order
shall be placed beyond 0.50 USD. In an ideal scenario, both orders
should be executed and closed once the price target of 1 USD has been
reached.

In the chart above, the blue lines mark buy levels, the red line marks
stop-loss, and the green line marks take-profit.

Be aware of risks when opening such trades! Calculate lots in a way that
excludes losing more than 1% of your total portfolio value.

 _The[XRPUSD][2] price technical analysis is presented by [Mikhail
Hypov][7]. _

## Weekly Elliott wave Ripple analysis as of 23.08.2021

The XRPUSD market continues forming the corrective trend. After the
impulse upwave A finished, there has started developing a complex
corrective wave. There must forming a large double zigzag [W]-[X]-[Y].
So far, the sub-waves [W]-[X] completed. Sub-wave [Y] has just started
forming and could end as a double zigzag (W)-(X)-(Y). Let us study the
chart structure in more detail in a shorter timeframe.

At the time of writing, the first motive wave (W) has completed as a
simple zigzag A-B-C. There is now forming a zigzag-shaped linking wave
(X), namely its final sub-wave C. The C wave is likely to be a simple
impulse [1]-[2]-[3]-[4]-[5]. The first four legs of the impulse must
have finished, the price is now rising in the final sub-wave [5]. Wave
[5] should end at a level of around 1.402, where wave (X) will be 61.8%
of the (W) wave.

## Ripple Price Prediction for 2022 by Crypto Experts

Things aren’t less challenging for Ripple now. The price will keep
jumping until the SEC case is solved. Let's see what leading crypto
sources say about the Ripple value in 2022.

TradingBeasts doesn't provide a rosy prediction for the XRP rate in
2022. The average price won’t be able to break above $1. Starting the
year at 0.86, the average projected value will move to $0.72 by
December.

As for Wallet Investor, the Ripple price forecast is less pessimistic.
The platform predicts the price will stay above $1 most of the year. By
the end of the year, the price will be  $1.459. The maximum price won’t
break above $2.

Crypto Ground disagrees with such pessimistic forecasts. The source sees
a bullish trend in 2022. The price will be able to rise to $1.22.

Changelly platform: "As soon as XRP reaches $1, the correction phase may
enter. The most likely zone for XRP price in 2022 is from $0.5 to $1.
However, if the company gains support from the investment giants, the
XRP rate can change its direction to a new bull run."

The Economy Forecast Agency has a bearish forecast for Ripple in 2022.
The price will decline from $0.45 to $0.39 during the year.  Price
volatility won’t be high.

## Ripple Price Prediction for 2023 by Crypto Experts

Moving further, we see that although the price of XRP won’t hit
exclusive highs, the cryptocurrency won’t disappear. What awaits the XRP
coin price in 2023? How much will it cost?

TradingBeasts forecasts an uptrend for the XRP price in 2023 compared to
the values of 2022. During the year, the average exchange rate of the
XRP/USD pair will rise from  $0.7358 to $0.8343. The maximum price will
cross a $1 threshold.

The Wallet Investor [website](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/website-for-forex-trading/) isn't so negative about the XRP future. The
average price will stay above $1 during the whole year. Starting the
year at  $1.477, the rate will reach $1.847 by the last day of 2023. The
maximum price will break above the $2 level in November 2023.

Crypto Ground is still the most optimistic about the XRP price. Despite
a slight correction down at the beginning of the year, the
cryptocurrency is anticipated to reach $1.8091 by 2024.

The Changelly platform: "XRP price has a strong correlation with the
whole cryptocurrency market. It means that if Bitcoin or altcoins will
grow, then Ripple is likely to reach the previous all-time high point of
$3.84. This is a very optimistic scenario. If the SEC wins the lawsuit,
the XRP price can fall down to a couple of cents."

The Economy Forecast Agency is bearish about Ripple in 2023. The price
will be set at $0.39 in January. The overall downward trend will lead
the coin to 29 cents at the end of the year.

## Long Term Ripple Prediction: 2025-2030

How much will Ripple be worth in 5-10 years? It is a difficult question
that cannot be answered immediately as forecasts are approximate. You
never know what will happen to the price tomorrow. Is it possible to
predict what will be in 5-10 years? It is, therefore, best to be aware
of the latest Ripple [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/). Then you know what the project and the
community are doing. To have a good understanding of the [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/)
projects, check which developments are planned, which collaborations
they are working on or already exist, how they are working with the
community, and other factors.

Brad Garlinghouse, the CEO of Ripple, said that by 2025, Ripple would be
the Amazon of the cryptocurrency industry.

Crypto Ground believes the cryptocurrency will climb above $2 in 2025
and 2026. The primary trend is bullish. In 2026, the price of XRP may
stay at $2.54.

The Wallet Investor [website](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/website-for-forex-trading/) is positive about XRP in 2025. The average
price will stay above $2 during the year. There is a chance it will
surge to $2.6 at the end of December 2025. As for the first six months
of 2026, the price will fluctuate near $2.5. The maximum price will
break above $3 threshold at the beginning of 2025.

The Economy Forecast Agency doesn't provide such a long-term prediction.
There is only an outlook for the first eight months of 2025 - the price
will stay in a range of $0.10-0.09.

Coin Price Forecast projections look realistic. The XRP is expected to
rise from $1.95 at the beginning of 2025 to $2.48 at the end of 2030.

## How Has The Price Of Ripple Changed Over Time?

It’s wrong to check XRP price predictions without looking back at recent
and not-so-recent events. The SEC situation made that even more precise.
The Ripple price today on 24.08.2021 is $1.24485. Looking at the full
price chart below, you can see how the price of XRP changed over the
years.

XRP was stable from its launch in 2013 until early 2017, when the
sideway movement ended. By the end of 2017, its price skyrocketed by
35,000%. This success occurred as Ripple managed to achieve a threshold
of 100 banks worldwide that signed on to RippleNet.

On January 4th, 2018, the [XRP/USD][4] rate reached an all-time high.
However, it couldn’t sustain those levels, and it subsequently dropped
by 76% within one month. The plummet was caused by fears of new
[regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/)s on the Asian markets. This factor affected not only XRP but
also other cryptos. In 2018, the total market cap for cryptocurrencies
declined by around 43%.

The sharp downtrend that continued until February was also boosted by
other factors. Facebook declared it would ban advertisements for
cryptocurrencies and ICOs. US regulators summoned Bitfinex and Tether to
a court. The further decline was spurred by the finance minister of
India, who said the country would do everything it could to discontinue
the use of virtual currencies.

However, the year did not only bring bad [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) for XRP. A significant
surge took place in September 2018. Within several days at the end of
September, Ripple grew by over 140%. The XRP/USD rate was pushed up
after Ripple’s Head of Regulatory Relations for Asia-Pacific and the
Middle East, Sagar Sarbhai, said the company would release a product to
expedite bank transactions with the use of XRP.

2019 was quite stable for Ripple, with no dramatic ups and downs. As the
Ripple network is very active in Southeast Asia, [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) on cross-border
payments and state cryptocurrencies in this region significantly impacts
its price. For instance, the XRP’s rate moved up after Japan and South
Korea started working on time and cost reduction for transferring
international funds between the two countries. By the end of 2019, the
downtrend strengthened. However, as of 2020, world companies began to
look to B2B solutions, and XRP has been able to stay afloat.

The year 2020 wasn’t marked by significant price movements. High
volatility occurred due to the SEC case. This legal action led to XRP’s
decline from around 70 cents to 20 cents.

At the beginning of 2021, XRP was gaining momentum. Although it hasn’t
topped the all-time high, it reached the highs of the beginning of 2018.

Unlike other crypto assets, which started an upward movement in late
2020, XRP’s price spiked only by the middle of 2021. Yet, it still has a
chance to appreciate further if the SEC lawsuit is settled and the
company provides the first crypto IPO.

## Is Ripple a Good Investment?

Should I invest in Ripple? Ripple: buy or sell? Maybe these questions
are still in your head. Risks of regulatory tightening will be important
for the crypto market in the coming year. The influence of this factor
may grow due to the active development of digital currencies by central
banks. Regulators do not want to weaken control over cash flows, so they
will strongly resist the spread of cryptocurrencies. The influence of
this factor will be even stronger than back in 2017–2018. The expected
development of DeFi is another risk for Ripple.

Oddly enough, the coronavirus pandemic can support the virtual market.
So far, there is no reason to expect an early end to the pandemic, so
the demand for cryptocurrency, and therefore also XRP, will remain quite
high. If the dominant driving force in the market had previously been
individuals, then in 2021, it is institutions. Therefore, next year we
will most likely see a smooth rise in the XRP coin. Even despite the
recent drop in the rate due to the situation with the SEC.

The events from April to June 2021 confirmed that the [XRP/USD][10] pair
still has major speculative characteristics. The pair still produces
volume and volatility. The XRP showed it can triple its capacity, then
lose almost everything. It’s a good point for aggressive traders.
