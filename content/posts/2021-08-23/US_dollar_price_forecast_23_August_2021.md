Dollar should be flexible. Forecast as of 23.08.2021Dmitri Demidenko

A new round of the pandemic turns economists into epidemiologists. The
[EURUSD][1] forecasts depend on the spread of the Delta variant of the
coronavirus. Will the Fed ignore the coronavirus and continue the
current course?

## Weekly US dollar fundamental forecast

What doesn’t kill you makes you stronger. Despite a series of
disappointing data on US consumer confidence, retail sales, and the real
estate market, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) demand for the US dollar has increased in
August. Investors are not discouraged by the deterioration of the
epidemiological situation in the USA. The matter is that the Delta
spread presses down not only the US economy but also the global growth,
which is evident from Citi’s economic surprise index. Amid the new wave
of the pandemic, the greenback has strengthened as a safe haven.
Paradoxically, the further deterioration of the epidemiological
situation in the USA could be the beginning of the end.

Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan said he’s open to adjusting his view
that the Federal Reserve should start tapering its $120-billion-a-month
asset-purchase program sooner rather than later if the Delta continues
spreading and hurts economic progress. The central bank, he says, has a
month to see how it all develops.

When the Fed’s hawk says he should be flexible and open-minded and
begins to draw ways to retreat from his previous position, it seems that
the [EURUSD][1] has dropped too deep. Along with the high demand for
safe-haven assets, the euro bears bet on the Fed's willingness to
normalize its monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). If the central bank resumes its wait-and-
see approach, the current trend will break. According to Commerzbank, if
the market changes its aggressive view on the Fed’s future [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), the
euro will be up to $1.2.

Remarkably, the level of 1.2 for the euro-dollar is the consensus
forecast of Bloomberg experts at the end of the first quarter of 2022.
Analysts at Danske Bank forecast the [EURUSD][1] will rally up amid a
renewal of the cross-asset reflation trade. This could happen if
economic growth in Europe turns out to be so strong that the ECB will be
forced to revise its forecasts up. Some analysts suggest that the recent
drop in commodity prices will slow inflation in the US and bring back
the Fed's passive [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), which used to press down the greenback in the
first half of 2021.

In fact, the consensus forecast for the [EURUSD][1] at 1.2 seems to be
positive, although it was higher previously. Now, the experts are
starting to adjust their forecasts, considering the euro drop to its
nine-month low. In addition, the [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) market only gives a 55% chance
of a rally in the euro to this level by the end of March. I like
Nordea's version more, expecting to see a pair at 1.1 amid four federal
funds rate hikes by the end of 2023. After all, I am willing to be
flexible and open-minded, just like Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan.
We shall see how the situation with the Delta will develop and how the
US economy will adjust to it.

### Weekly [EURUSD][1] trading plan

In the short run, if the [EURUSD][1] breaks out the resistance level of
1.174 and 1.1755, the price will go up to 1.18-1.1815, where the sellers
will go ahead.
