###  **Elliott wave[BTCUSD][1] analysis**

analysis Bitcoin, Ripple, Ethereum.][2]

The upward corrective wave B is likely to have completed within the down
zigzag A-B-C. According to its structure, this correction is a double
zigzag, it is composed of three sub-waves [W]-[X]-[Y]. After it
finished, the market has started declining following the bear impulse
wave C. The first leg of its impulse wave, sub-wave [1], may have
completed as a leading diagonal. Presumably, the entire wave C should
finish at the level of the previous low, hit by impulse A. An
approximate trajectory of the [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/) future price movement is outlined
in the chart.

The deep correction [4] is likely to have completed as a triple zigzag
(w)-(x)-(y)-(x)-(z). After wave [4] finished, the market has started
declining in the initial portion of the impulse wave [5]. The bear sub-
wave 1 is likely to have completed as a leading diagonal. Corrective
wave 2 is now unfolding. The entire impulse wave [5] is likely to
complete at a level around 0.108. This is the low made by the previous
impulse [3].

###  **Elliott wave[ETHUSD][5] analysis**

analysis Bitcoin, Ripple, Ethereum.][6]

The upward corrective wave [4] is likely to have completed within the
final impulse wave (C), which is a part of the long-term down zigzag.
Correction [4] is a double zigzag (W)-(X)-(Y). After this double zigzag
completed, the market has started following the initial portion of the
bear impulse wave [5]. Wave (1) should have completed as a leading
diagonal, and the price is now rising in the correction (2). As wave [5]
has just started unfolding, the market should be declining towards a
level of 98.67 in the next few weeks, as it is outlined in the chart.
