Best Forex tools 2020Oleg Tkachenko

The trader’s main tool is a trading platform, but it’s not enough for
reaching success. There are lots of other tools that make money earning
easier and faster: numerous applications, scripts, copy trading
services. This review will cover them all. Read on to learn about the
best Forex trading tools 2020.

What tools do you usually use while trading? A trading platform,
obviously. But is it enough? What about mobile trading apps? Or trading
advisers? Also, there are paid or free services for trading signals,
copy trading services, trader’s diaries, and so on. Everyone has their
favourite sets of tools and I invite you to share them in the comments
section.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Review of the best Forex trading tools

### Rating of Forex tools

The rating below is subjective, but at least it will introduce you to a
trader’s auxiliary tools. I use a great deal of those tools myself.

### 1\. Best desktop trading platform 2020 - MetaTrader

MetaQuotes’ products MT4 and MT5 have been the market leaders for many
years. These platforms bring together functionality, convenient
visualization and user-friendliness. Though the platforms seem
overloaded with tools, 3-4 hours of trial and Google tips will be enough
to become a confident user.

 **МТ4 advantages**

  * Constant assistance by MetaQuotes: updating and troubleshooting.  None of other platforms can deliver an analogue of the MQL5 site with the same toolkit.
  * Opportunity to add indicators, [advisor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/expert-advisor/)s, and scripts in MQL4 language. Though the platform offers a few dozens of embedded indicators, figures and charts, you can order code writing for MT4 to meet your trading system’s requirements.  There hardly exist any platforms offering such an opportunity.
  * Dedicated set of [functions](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/basic-functions/) for [testing and optimizing][1] indicators and trading advisers.

The fourth version of MetaTrader is more popular than the latest fifth
one. Working on the newest version, the developers added into MT5 a
fully-fledged option of market depth, a few additional orders, non-
standard time frames, etc. That didn’t impress traders for one reason:
most indicators and advisers are tailored to MT4 and aren’t readjusted
to MT5. The only thing in which MetaTrader 5 outperforms MT4 is testing
and optimizing trading systems.

### 2\. Best web trading platform 2020 - LiteForex

The most popular trading platform is LiteForex’s platform built into the
[Client’s area][2]. Unlike Mt4, it’s totally understandable at the first
sight. The developers managed to offer an optimal set of [functions](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/basic-functions/) and a
user-friendly interface.

 **Advantages of LiteForex’s platform:**

  * Advanced data transmission. No slowdowns or delays in orders execution on both the server and the platform.
  * Additional indicators, which are absent in MT4.
  * Extra [functions](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/basic-functions/): one-click order control, analytical tips (market sentiment, signals of trend indicators and oscillators), user chat with professional analyses and [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/).
  * The platform is adapted to any versions of mobile devices.
  * It features an embedded service for copy trading and a set of [functions](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/basic-functions/) for creating various affiliate programs, with or without a cashback. More details are provided [here][3].

LiteForex’s Forex platform is a perfect option for active beginner
traders and passive investments. Just have a go and open a few trades on
this popular platform. You gonna like it!

### 3\. Best trading analysis [website](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/website-for-forex-trading/) 2020

There are two sites that claim victory in this category and either of
them is convenient and useful based on what your goals are.

  *  **Investing (investing.com).** It’s a free analytical portal with 15 millions of unique users per month. It provides information on currency, stock and commodity markets worldwide and it is focused on professional traders. The charts of various assets, including exotic ones, are updated every second. Here a trader will find whatever he or she needs: stock screeners, volatility and profitability calculators, pivot points and other auxiliary tools. Private analytical opinions are published here too. Though they should be read with a sceptic eye, they can often suggest interesting thoughts.

  *  **Tradingview (tradingview.com).** This is a technical analysis platform and a social network for traders which provides anything, starting with scripts and ending with analysis. Its user-friendliness and toolkit outperforms those of MT4. As to analytical publications, requirements are less strict here, so you need to filter information more carefully. On the other hand, the site users are regular traders and economic amateurs that are ready to discuss any financial ideas.

Thus, Investing suits better professional traders and global market
observers. Tradingview is a platform for discussing various ideas,
points of view and forecasts. That’s why I recommend checking
LiteForex’s blog too. Professional traders share their long experience
and ideas here. Some of them are authors at Investing too. Have a look
and you will like it!

### 4\. Best [Forex trading](https://www.fintechee.com/forex-trading-strategies/) apps 2020

Every professional trader at LiteForex has a few interesting apps at
hand.



  * [Trading strategies.][4] This free mobile Forex app for Android accumulates dozens of various strategies for any asset: with or without indicators, scalping or long-term investment strategies, with or without martingale. There are simple strategies for training and complicated strategies for logical puzzles. There are even strategies for binary [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/). Each strategy is accompanied with a short useful description.
  * [Free trading signals.][5] Regular updates on 12 currency pairs and 10 assets of the stock and commodity markets. Signals are traders’ auxiliary tool.  They are based on technical indicators and [automated](https://www.fintechee.com/features/automated-forex-trading/) definition of patterns. This mobile Forex app can be downloaded free of charge.
  * [Tradary][6]. This is an application for those who analyse trading results and statistics. There’s a trial period. Reports are sorted by type of asset, trade period, day, [ranking](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/crypto-exchange-ranking/), etc.

### 5\. Most popular trading strategy 2020 - Quickfinger Luc. (QFL)

It’s time to examine the best Forex [trading strategies](https://www.fintechee.com/forex-trading-strategies/) 2020. Here’s a
very interesting one based on human emotionality: it teaches you [how to](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-trading-how-to/)
profit from the crowd’s panic which pushes the price in the opposite
direction once a psychologically important level is achieved. The
strategy’s main idea is determining some of the basic notions of
technical analysis: price levels at which either party’s emotional
reaction takes place; a moment of retracement from those levels; a
strong impulsive move. A trader’s task is:

  * Finding a base level in the chart and assessing if a retracement is possible;
  * Evaluating similar retracements from similar levels in the past;
  * Finding out why sharp price movements occurred after retracements.
  * Comparing relative strength of movements after each retracement;
  * Opening a trade after a retracement and setting appropriate values of pending orders.

You can check the details of the strategy [here][7].

### 6\. Best forex [advisor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/expert-advisor/) 2020 - Ilan Dynamic

Best Forex adviser – Ilan, or one of its versions. This program is often
criticized for blowing up accounts, but it remains one of the most
discussed programs on trading forums. There exist over 5 versions of
Ilan Forex [advisor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/expert-advisor/) and plenty of examples of earning money with its
help. The thing is it should be used wisely, [optimize](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/17/added-genetic-algorithm-for-trading/)d in advance and
constantly observed.

Ilan Dynamic is a grid indicator with martingale elements. It doesn’t
search for signals. What it does is place orders to the both sides of
the price so that pending orders should close with profits. The trader
needs to set the grid step and martingale coefficient correctly. I
wouldn’t call this program “most reliable and profitable Forex [advisor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/expert-advisor/)”,
but ideal [robot](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/automated-forex-trading-robot/)s don’t exist. So, much depends on a trader’s expertise.
This [advisor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/expert-advisor/) is examined at length in this [review][8].

### 7\. Best forex copy trading service 2020 - Social Trading by
LiteForex

Not only regular financial tools can be used for earning. Non-standard
[options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) can bring money for both beginner and professional Forex traders
too.  This is a unique service for copying Forex trades where everyone
can act both as a trader and an [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/). A professional trader allows
copying his/her signals and gets featured in LiteForex’s [ranking](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/crypto-exchange-ranking/) of
traders. Every [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) may choose one or several traders. After a
profitable trade is closed, an [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) gets his/her profits and pays a
fee to his/her trader. No need to draw graphic patterns and trend lines,
observe support and resistance levels or use Japanese candlesticks:
professionals will do that for you.

 **Advantages of Social Trading by LiteForex:**

  * Honest [ranking](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/crypto-exchange-ranking/) of real traders; real statistics of the broker’s traders;
  * Extended set of [functions](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/basic-functions/); an [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) may form as many investment portfolios including various groups of traders as he/she wishes.  Also, an [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) may act as an intermediary: he or she may form a well-balanced portfolio of aggressive and conservative traders and offer signals to other [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s for a fee.
  * Risk [optimization](https://www.fintechee.com/features/genetic-algorithm-for-trading/). Every trader is associated with a certain risk degree calculated by LiteForex’s internal risk management system. These degrees can serve as an additional guidance.

More details on Forex social trading service are provided [here][9].

### 8\. Best forex indicator 2020 - TD Sequential

Classic trading indicators based on various types of averaging are being
replaced with new-generation Forex analytical tools. TD Sequential
belongs to the latter category. It detects the ending of local trends
and helps define a trend fading and reversal. Author Tom DeMark
dedicated a whole book to the trading system based on that indicator,
which you can [download here][10]. To put it shortly, the essence of
every step and signal can be described as follows:

The market is cyclic. The length of cycles is different, but they have
some particular phases:

  *  **Start phase:**   Price Flip. Reversal pattern which consists of 6 candlesticks. The penultimate and ultimate candlesticks’ closing prices are compared with closing prices registered 4 candlesticks earlier.
  *  **Setup phase.** Sequence of 9 candlesticks where closing prices are compared in a certain order according to a certain formula. The indicator draws support and resistance levels (TDST according to DeMark). One of the strategies implies opening a trade after a reversal pattern has occurred in this phase.
  *  **Countdown phase.** Consists of 13 candlesticks whose order isn’t necessarily consecutive. This phase ends with the start of Price Flip pattern. According to DeMark, a trade may be opened at the beginning of this phase too.

The MQL5 site has already provided a draft version of using TD
Sequential in a [neural network](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/17/added-genetic-algorithm-for-trading/), new-generation trading advisers that can
self-train and deliver necessary results (pre-written in the code). Two
versions of Forex indicator for МТ4 TD Sequential can be [downloaded
here][11]. Detailed manual is provided [here][12].

TD Sequential can be used as an independent trading strategy or combined
with other tools, such as an indicator of trading sessions. It helps
detect a correlation between a particular phase and a sessional
activity.

### 9\. Advanced trading tools 2020

The most promising trading tools are those that you can profit from when
they grow or fall in price, because Forex allows opening both long and
short positions.

 **9.1. Cryptocurrency.** Cryptocurrencies are so volatile that they
have remained the most promising financial instrument for a few years.
Daily average fluctuations are 0.5-1.5%, but they can go up to 3-5%. In
a month, ВТСUSD may grow or fall 15-25%, which is impossible in any
other markets. Just have a look at the chart below:

 **Advantages of crypto-trading:**

  * Perfect for intraday strategies. Even the simplest ones sometimes turn out to be really efficient: cryptocurrency is a highly liquid tool with a tight spread.
  * Fluctuations are relatively easy to forecast. Two factors affect the rate the most: [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/), which is easily interpreted and can back up the trend; psychological speculative factor which allows implementing strategies by use of support and resistance levels.

 **9.2. Oil.** The epidemic of coronavirus and the OPEC+ deal collapse
have made oil quotes fall more than 40% this year. But every collapse is
followed by a recovery because a new deal will be made sooner or later.
So, the prices are very likely to have returned to their equilibrium
state by the end of the year, with profitability of at least 30%
relative to the bottom value.

 **9.3. NASDAQ.**

NASDAQ was the most profitable stock index in 2019. The US stock market
grew in general, but the key factor in NASDAQ’s high profitability was
the basket of high-tech companies that constantly develop and will be
demanded even in crisis times.

The beginning of the year wasn’t favourable to stock markets. But if we
check the statistics on the past years, we will see that such drawdowns
are regular. After every drawdown, indexes recovered within a few
months. So, wait till the bottom is reached and invest in long
positions. Twenty percent per annum is quite a real value.

## Conclusion

The best trading tools should always be at hand. When everything you
need is at your command, you feel confident and can reach your goals
faster. I hope you’ve found something useful on that list. If you have
