Dollar steps in the old path. Forecast as of 25.11.2020Dmitri Demidenko

In previous years, US presidents didn’t interfere in the foreign
exchange market as often as Donald Trump did. Joe Biden is coming to
power, and the Forex trends are to return to the former patterns. How
will this affect [EURUSD][1]? Let us discuss the Forex outlook and make
up a trading plan.

## Monthly [EURUSD][1] fundamental forecast

Slogans and real actions are often two completely opposite things. US
presidents from Bill Clinton to Barack Obama expressed their commitment
to a strong dollar [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). However, because of this [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)'s
transparency, the greenback often fell during their [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of office.
Donald Trump, on the contrary, talked about the advantages of a weak
currency. Trump accused other countries of currency manipulations,
called on the Fed to cut interest rates and resume the QE. Nonetheless,
the USD was growing because of the certainty created by Trump’s
administration. That is why I believe there are important bearish
drivers for the greenback's weakening in the future. Joe Biden comes
back to the old slogan ‘String dollar reflects the strength of the US
economy.’ Biden nominates Janet Yellen for Treasury Secretary.

The market should forget the shocks resulting from the President's
unexpected commentaries, which the US administration would try to smooth
over the next day. During Trump’s term of office, forex analysts used to
say that what was good for Trump was good for the dollar. As a safe-
haven, greenback often benefited from the uncertainty, fueled by Trump’s
unpredictable and eccentric tweets. Forex is coming back to old
patterns. Besides, the hopes for the global economic recovery press down
the safe-haven assets.

Investors discuss the controversial rally of the US stock indexes by 60%
up from March’s low amid the US economy’s weakness. However, no matter
how terrible they are, recessions rarely happen and end rather quickly,
so everyone is rushing to buy stocks. For decades, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s have been
guided by three principles: spare no money, buy and hold, and finally
buy on the price fall. Such simple investment strategies have been and
continue to be profitable! The [Do][2][w Jones][2] has hit level 30000
for the first time. The [S&P 500][3], according to the median gauge of
40 experts polled by Reuters, should be 9% up from the current levels by
the end of 2021.

### Dynamics of [Dow Jones][2] and US GDP

The major bullish factor is the hopes that the global economy should
return to the pre-crisis levels in the second half of next year.
Bloomberg suggests the global GDP will rise by 4.9%. Goldman Sachs
expects that the vaccines and a fresh fiscal stimulus of $1 trillion
provided by Congress will support the US economic growth by 5%.
Furthermore, the recovery can come sooner because of the delayed demand.
According to the Commerce Department,  households have paid down debt,
and the personal saving rate was a high 14.3% compared with 8.3% before
the pandemic. People are ready to spend money. So isn't it the time to
buy stocks now? Tomorrow it might be late.

### Monthly [EURUSD][1] trading plan

The easing of political uncertainty and the [S&P 500][3] rally
encourages the [EURUSD][1] bulls. My suggestion for the movement of the
trading range from 1.16-1.2 to 1.18-1.22 seems to be correct. The price
rebound from the bottom of figure 18 allowed us to enter longs. Continue
holding up the longs and enter new ones.
