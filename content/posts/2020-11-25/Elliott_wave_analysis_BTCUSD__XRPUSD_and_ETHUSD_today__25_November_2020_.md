Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 25.11.2020Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I suggest entry signals
to trade each cryptocurrency.

The three major cryptocurrency pairs are rising in the impulse sub-
waves. Let study the cryptocurrencies’ charts in more detail.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

 ****

In early October 2020, the BTCUSD market started forming the upward
impulse wave C that is an element of the bullish zigzag of a larger
degree. Wave C is composed of the sub-waves [1]-[2]-[3]-[4]-[5]. The
small sub-waves [1], [2], [4] must have completed. The strong impulse
[3] has also completed. There is now forming the initial part of the
sub-waves [5]. The price should be rising in impulse wave (3) towards a
level of 21227.15. Next, after a short drawdown in correction (4), the
price will continue rising in wave (5), as it is outlined in the chart.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 19090.00, TP 21227.15

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

The most recent section of the chart displays the bullish impulse C
unfolding. The upward impulse wave [3] must have completed. There is
forming the initial part of the bearish correction [4]. Wave [4] should
not be large, so the market should shortly start rising in the final
wave [5], as it is outlined in the chart. The entire uptrend could end
at a level of around 0.840. One could enter long positions in the
current situation.

### Trading plan for **[XRPUSD][2]** today:

Buy 0.641, TP 0.840

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

 ****

The ETHUSD market is also forming the final leg of the upward zigzag
A-B-C; it is the C impulse. The sub-waves [1]-[2]-[3]-[4] have
completed, and the large impulse wave [5] is yet unfolding. There is
developing the final wave (5) of [5], where three legs out of five have
completed. The price should decline a little in the down corrective wave
4. When wave 4 completes, the market should resume rising in wave 5
towards a level of 653.00.

### Trading plan for  **[ETHUSD][3] **today:

Buy 602.69, TP 653.00
