Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 27.07.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

The XRPUSD market seems to be forming an ending diagonal, which should
conclude the bullish impulse.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

The BTCUSD market must e forming the final motive wave of the bullish
double zigzag (W)-(X)-(Y), sub-wave (Y). The (Y) wave is composed of the
sub-waves A-B-C. Impulse wave A looks complete. The bearish correction B
is to finish soon. The market should turn up and start rising in impulse
wave C to a level of 38910.00. At this level, wave (Y) will be 123.6% of
wave (W). One could enter purchases in the current situation.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 37021.50, TP 38910.00

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

The final wave C is developing in the flat pattern A-B-C. The C wave is
unfolding as a five-wave bullish impulse [1]-[2]-[3]-[4]-[5]. The first
four parts of this impulse have completed. There is unfolding the final
sub-wave [5] as an ending diagonal, as wave (4) should finish further
than sub-wave (1). The price should rise to a level higher than 0.677,
where wave (3) finished. One could enter purchases in the current
situation.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] **** today:

Buy 0.622, TP 0.677

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

The chart displays the structure of the bullish correction B, which is a
simple zigzag [A]-[B]-[C]. Wave [A] is a leading diagonal, correction
[B] is a bearish triple zigzag. Wave [C] is an impulse
(1)-(2)-(3)-(4)-(5). The first four sub-waves of the [C] impulse must
have completed, so the market should be rising in the final sub-wave (5)
to a level of 2425.00, where waves [A] and [C] will be equal.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Buy 2185.13, TP 2425.00
