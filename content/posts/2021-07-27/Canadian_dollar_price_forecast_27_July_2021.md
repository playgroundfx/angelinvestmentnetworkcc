Canadian dollar relies on reflation. Forecast as of 27.07.2021Dmitri
Demidenko

The Canadian dollar, which was at its peak in the first half of 2021,
lost ground in the middle of summer. Will the dollar return to its
former popularity? The answer to this question depends on the pandemic
and the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the central banks. Let us discuss the Forex outlook
and make up a [USDCAD][1] trading plan

## Weekly Canadian dollar fundamental forecast

If the crowd's opinion was always correct, the Sun would still revolve
around the Earth. When due to the spread of the Delta and the intentions
of central banks to withdraw monetary stimulus, the market majority
begins to doubt the reflation trade, it is time to think about its
return. What assets were successful in the past? In the first half of
2020, the leader among the G10 currencies was the Canadian dollar. In
the middle of summer, the loonie lost ground, but [the idea to sell][2]
[USDCAD][1] in the level of 1.275 won out. Are the Bears waiting for the
continuation of a successful streak?

The loonie has much more advantages than disadvantages. In the Bloomberg
[ranking](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/crypto-exchange-ranking/), which takes into account the proportion of the vaccinated
population, the vaccination rate and the number of COVID cases, Canada
ranks first. Already 55.4% of its adult population has two shots,
compared to 49% in the US and 46% in the EU.

The geographical proximity to the United States, with its fiscal
incentives, keeps Canada's exports, GDP and labor market looking great
and provides the BoC with an opportunity to normalize monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).
At its July meeting, BoC employees cut weekly asset purchases from CA$3
billion to CA$2 billion and said that the overnight rate is likely to
remain unchanged until the second half of 2022. The derivatives market
expects 4 acts of monetary restriction over the next two years, which
will make borrowing costs in Canada the highest among the G10.

A successful fight against the pandemic, a strong economy and
normalization of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) are good reasons for the CAD purchases,
however, in the second decade of July, the Canadian currency collapsed.
All because of excessively stretched speculative longs, or rather,
exiting of [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s against the backdrop of a collapse in oil prices
due to the Delta and fears for the fate of the world economy. The oil
recovery pushed the commodity index up and highlighted the divergence
between the black stuff and [USDCAD][1] price. The Canadian dollar looks
undervalued.

### Dynamics of USDCAD and Commodity Market Index

Sharp changes in [Brent][3] and [WTI][4] prices contributed to the
normalization of the Canadian dollar. The market got rid of ballast, and
in case of a return of optimism about the global economy's prospects
and/or the Fed's dovish stance (that is, trading on reflation), the
[USDCAD][1] price has a good chance of continuing the decline. In this
situation, [CADJPY][5] purchases will look attractive. Most likely carry
traders will provide the support for the CADJPY bulls.

### Weekly [USDCAD][1] trading plan

[The recommendation][6] to sell [USDCAD][1] from the upper border of the
trading range 1.23-1.275 turned out to be very successful. The further
fate of the pair will depend on the FOMC meeting. The return of the
Fed's wait-and-see approach is fraught with the continuation of the
decline to 1.248 and 1.24. On the contrary, hints of a QE tapering will
allow selling the US dollar against the CAD on the rise.
