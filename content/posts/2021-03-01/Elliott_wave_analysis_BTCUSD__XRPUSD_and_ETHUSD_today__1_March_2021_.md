Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 01.03.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

The XRPUSD market is forming a skewed triangle. When the triangle
completes, the market will continue declining. Bitcoin and Ethereum are
forming bullish linking waves within the double zigzags.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

The BTCUSD has completed the global bullish impulse. The chart displays
its final wave [5], namely its final leg. Next, there has started a
corrective pattern. There is likely to be forming a bearish double
zigzag. The first sub-wave [W] must have completed as a double zigzag.
Therefore, the market should be rising in the linking wave [X] to a
level of 52500.00, where wave [X] will reach the Fibonacci ratio of
61.8% of wave [W].

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 46365.00, TP 52500.00

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

The Ripple market is forming a down simple zigzag, composed of the three
major sub-waves [A]-[B]-[C]. The impulse wave [A] finished, and the
corrective wave [B] completed as a triple zigzag. The price is now
declining in the impulse wave [C]. Its fourth sub-wave seems to be a
triangle and is about to end soon. Therefore, when the skewed triangle
(4) completes, the price will resume declining in wave (5) to a level of
0.300.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] today:

Sell 0.420, TP 0.300

## Elliott wave Ethereum analysis

The Ethereum market has completed a large impulse wave. Next, the price
has started declining, following a new corrective pattern. The ETHUSD,
like the BTCUSD, is likely to be forming a bearish double zigzag W-X-Y.
Wave W must have completed as a standard zigzag, so the market should be
rising in the linking wave X to a level of 1710.00, where wave X will
reach 61.8% of W, according to Fibonacci retracements. This ratio is
highly likely to be reached.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Buy 1427.78, TP 1710.00
