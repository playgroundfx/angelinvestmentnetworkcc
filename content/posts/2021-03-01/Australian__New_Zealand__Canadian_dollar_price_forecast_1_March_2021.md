Commodity currencies came down to earth. Forecast for AUDUSD, NZDUSD and
USDCAD as of 01.03.2021Dmitri Demidenko

The most serious market movements occur when euphoria is replaced by
panic. The collapse of [AUDUSD][1], [NZDUSD][2], and [USDCAD][3]
confirms this. What will happen to commodity currencies? Let us discuss
the Forex outlook and make up a trading plan.

## Quarterly commodity currencies fundamental forecast

What happened in Forex at the end of winter is another example of a
sharp change in market trends. Investors have enjoyed the success they
have achieved, seriously hoping that massive monetary stimulus and
inflation will trigger a new supercycle in the commodity market.
Speculative net longs of 20 commodities have been updating all-time
highs for five consecutive weeks, and the Bloomberg Commodity Index has
reached an all-time high. As soon as doubts appeared that the Fed would
not do what its officials have said, the euphoria was replaced by panic.

It is difficult to resist buying commodity currencies when the big banks
are talking about the start of a supercycle, oil, copper, and other raw
materials are growing by leaps and bounds, and excessively high [S&P
500][4] values ​​force [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s to look to other markets. In general,
the idea of ​​a supercycle looks pretty realistic. Since producers of
raw materials have reduced investment during the pandemic and lockdowns,
the supply against the global economic recovery background is likely to
grow slower than demand, which will contribute to higher prices. At the
same time, inflation will accelerate, which will increase the demand for
commodity market assets.

### Commodity growth cycle

Due to the commodity market condition, Australian, New Zealand, and
Canadian dollars were Forex favorites. Investors looked with a smile at
the attempts of issuing central banks to knock down the growth in the
yield of sovereign bonds through verbal interventions or increasing the
scale of purchases in the framework of QE. However, it is one thing if
debt market rates rise slowly, another if they grow by leaps and bounds.
Such dynamics of bond yields inspire fears that the Fed and other
regulators' adaptive monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) may turn out to be short-lived, no
matter how much they say otherwise. At the end of February, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s
stopped believing the Fed and began to include the risks of a repeat of
the 2013 taper tantrum in the dollar pairs prices on Forex. The more so
because among the victims are currencies of countries with a negative
current account balance.

### Currencies' reaction to the 2013 taper tantrum

Like almost eight years ago, one of the main victims of rumors about the
Fed's transition to monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) normalization was the Australian
dollar. So don't be surprised at its fall by almost 4% after two trading
days. Yes, it turned out to be painful, but is it worth panicking?

Even though the RBA is ready to intervene in the debt market and put a
spoke in the AUDUSD bulls' wheels, and the commodity market fell into a
correction, it is too early to talk about a trend reversal. If FOMC
officials will show concern about the growth of US Treasury yields and
associate it with worsening financial conditions, everything will return
to normal. The commodity market will resume its growth, and commodity
currencies will again become Forex favorites.

In my opinion, [AUDUSD][1], [NZDUSD][2], and [USDCAD][3] corrections
provide us with a unique opportunity to buy the Australian, New Zealand,
and Canadian dollars cheaper with targets at least at 0.8, 0.745, and
1.248, respectively.
