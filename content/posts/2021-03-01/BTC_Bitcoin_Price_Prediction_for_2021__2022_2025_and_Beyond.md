BTC Price Predictions and Analysis: Bitcoin Breaks Through the Roof!Jana
Kane

Bitcoin breaks a price record again! The coin broke the $34,000 mark on
January 3rd, 2021. How did this advance come about? The rise to $30,000
really only started in the second half of 2020. It has been a turbulent
year, both inside and outside the Bitcoin scene. Time for a brief look
back: what big things happened in the world of Bitcoin, and how did this
beautiful record price come about? And what can we expect from the
crypto-king next? Will the price of Bitcoin go up even more? Let's find
out!

The article covers the following subjects:

## Bitcoin in Short

We're sure you know, but Bitcoin is the best-known digital currency
(also known as cryptocurrency). It was the very first decentralized
currency that works by means of [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) technology. The currency was
launched in 2009, in the midst of a global financial crisis. Because
many people were suspicious of banks, Bitcoin immediately won the
interest of a large group of people.

The system allows you to send "money" to someone else without the
intervention of a third party. The data is not managed by one person but
by all users of the network. This makes it one large decentralized
database of transactions.

## Bitcoin Price Development and Outlook

First of all, let’s address the price development of [Bitcoin][1]. In
the image below, you can clearly see the various major events and the
price increase. A lot has happened in the past year.

###



March 13: Bitcoin Crash

The first [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) in the 2020 annual review is immediately the most
negative. It happened on the night of March 12, when the price fell to
$3,850 in no time (Coinmarketcap). However, the panic was not only in
the crypto market. The coronavirus also caused a search for liquidity in
the stock market. The AEX closed that week with the largest drop since
1987, a drop of more than 10%. The crash fits into the list of the 6
biggest descents ever.

With three other falls, the former exchange Mt. Gox was (indirectly)
involved. That same night, the BitMEX derivatives exchange was
temporarily out of reach. It was rumored that a failing stock exchange
liquidation engine was the cause of the deep spike down. A few days
later, the derivatives exchange tried to clear the air by announcing
that it fell prey to two DDoS attacks.

### May 11: Halving

In the past year, something unique happened that had not happened often
before: the halving of the block subsidy. On the 11th of May, there was
finally the [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) that had been long-awaited. For the first time ever, a
miner processed a block with a subsidy of "only" 6.25 BTC. With that,
Bitcoin entered a new era.

The timing was perfect: while the world was on fire and stimulus and
money packages kept the economy going, the opposite happened with
Bitcoin: assets became scarcer.

Since May this year, only 900 new BTC have come into circulation per day
instead of 1800 BTC (as was the case for four years). This supply shock
soon became visible in the price: the supply dried up, and the price
rose.

### June 4: Bitcoin Core Update

The [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) from the beginning of June may not have been spectacular, but
it was not superfluous by any means. Throughout the year, many
developers have worked hard on Bitcoin's code. While this has not caused
very big price increases, it is still hugely important [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/).

Bitcoin Core is the beating heart of everything that happens in the
ecosystem. The 28th upgrade came in June. This upgrade was the result,
which 119 developers worked on for six months.

The major improvement was that OpenSSL was removed from the code. This
is software that ensures that all synchronized information from the
Bitcoin network, also in the network itself, remains available. It’s a
kind of database within a database, simply put. With version 0.20.0,
OpenSSL has been "completely removed," Folkson said. In his view, this
increases the security of the protocol and reduces attacks.

### July 22: BTC Banking

In July, the US Bitcoin industry got a bit more legitimacy. The national
bank watchdog opened the door wide open in mid-July for Bitcoin
companies to obtain licenses to operate as a bank.

The Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) indicated that banks in the US
might be allowed to offer Bitcoin services. The OCC is a government body
that supervises the national banks. They monitor the enforcement of the
laws.

This mainly concerns custody services, i.e., the storage of Bitcoin. In
the second half of the year, the first companies have already jumped on
this [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/): Avanti, Kraken, BitPay, and Paxos have all applied for a
license and bank charter.

Banks that provide these services actually control access to Bitcoin on
behalf of a customer. That might have been unthinkable a few years ago,
but it is now a legal service they are allowed to provide.

### August 6: MicroStrategy

The most bullish [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) of 2020 comes from August. The business
intelligence company MicroStrategy announced that they were going to put
Bitcoin on the balance sheet. The reason? The Inflation Ghost. Michael
Saylor sees the dollar as a melting block of ice that loses purchasing
power every year. During the year, Saylor emerged as a [permabull][2].
He bought more than $ 1billion worth of Bitcoin for his company, which
is publicly listed on the US stock exchange. He did this in multiple
batches.

On August 6, MicroStrategy traded $ 250 million for 21,454 BTC. Around
September 15, the company took it a step further with 16,796 BTC. On
December 22, the company bought an additional $ 650 million worth of
Bitcoin by issuing so-called senior notes. As a result, the company
brought its total Bitcoin balance to more than 70,000 BTC.

### October 2: BitMEX

In addition to the price hike, perhaps the most shocking [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) of October
was all about the derivatives platform BitMEX. The exchange has been
sued by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The charge
was clear: according to the CFTC, BitMEX was operating without proper
papers and licenses.

Ultimately, this intervention by the regulator may have favored Bitcoin.
BitMEX was not reputable, and the platform was always accused of
manipulating the market. Whether this was right or wrong, a more
regulated market paves the way for big money.

### October 21: PayPal

PayPal opened its doors to Bitcoin in mid-October. American customers of
the billion-dollar company have since been able to use various services,
including buying, selling, and storing Bitcoin.

PayPal does not facilitate withdrawals, however. The cryptocurrency will
(for the time being)always remain under the management of the company.
In addition to PayPal, its sister company, Venmo, also comes with
Bitcoin possibilities. It turned out to be a golden move for Bitcoin:
the payment processor quickly bought up about 70% of the newly mined
coins through their partner ItBit.

In response to the [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/), the price of Bitcoin skyrocketed. A week later,
on October 28, it even hit its 2020 high of around $13,900 (Bitstamp &
Coinbase). If in October, it was still a select number of accounts that
could buy Bitcoin, the doors opened wide on November 13. It again
resulted in a price increase.

### Fall 2020: Institutional Money

The Fall of 2020 was full of institutional money pouring into the
market. MicroStrategy kicked it off, but soon others followed. Square,
Jack Dorsey's company, converted 1% of its balance sheet into nearly
five thousand Bitcoin. Stone Ridge later also followed for $115 million.

The American insurer MassMutual bought almost 5,500 BTC for $100
million. Guggenheim Partners also participated. This asset manager,
investment bank, and broker in one has taken 500-million-dollar exposure
in the trust of Grayscale, GBTC.

Ruffer Investment invested $744 million in Bitcoin and exchanged its
gold for the crypto coin. That is about 2.7% of the assets that the
British company manages. It is said to be 45,000 BTC. Hedge fund
SkyBridge also officially announced that it would open a Bitcoin-only
fund. They join a growing list of asset managers who do not want to pass
up the [cryptocurrency price](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/cryptocurrency-price/) action. They also bought up $ 25 million
worth of Bitcoin themselves.

### All-Time Highs

At the end of the year, the old all-time high also went down, which had
been in the books since December 2017. On November 25th, the "20k" mark
was broken for the first time. On December 31st, the price hit a new
record high of around $29,300 (Coinbase, Bitstamp) after experiencing a
rise of several thousand dollars during Christmas. And finally, on the
third day of the new year, BTC reached a huge new record: $34,000 per
Bitcoin! Currently, Bitcoin is traded at $48 617.45.

## Bitcoin Price Predictions for 2021 by Crypto Experts

Bitcoin has been setting jaw-dropping records over the past couple of
days. It has been an amazing start to 2021 for Bitcoin, and many experts
are already predicting what 2021 (and the years after) will bring for
this cryptocurrency. So far, opinions have been even more optimistic.

According to a [Finder.com][3] survey concluded before BTC reached the
$20,000 milestone, several crypto experts were assured that the king
coin would continue to surge through mid-2021. Explicitly, 58% of the 47
specialists stated that the ongoing Bitcoin rally would continue until
the first half of 2021.

Also, the survey discovered that panelists are confident that the
Bitcoin price would have grown two times by the end of the coming year.
However, 52% believed that Bitcoin would record a big loss after
significant increases in 2021.

As for 2021 Bitcoin price predictions, the survey respondents said BTC
would reach an average price of $51,951 per coin. In November,
[Citibank][4] analyst Tom Fitzpatrick noted that Bitcoin would hit
$318,000.

Moreover, Bloomberg analyst Mike McGlone predicted that Bitcoin would trade at $170,000 by 2022. In an interview with Bloomberg Television, he [said]5.

> “The key thing about Bitcoin this year is very simple - it just added
a one to the front of the number. Remember, it was around $7,000 at the
end of last year. What I’m worried about- if you look at the past
performance, which is potentially indicative of the future, next year or
two could add a zero to the back of the number.”

Earlier this year, Morgan Creek CEO Mark Yusko [said][6] that Bitcoin
could trade at $100,000 in 2021 or 2022. In the interview, the CEO added
that BTC could also climb $400 to $500k.

## Bitcoin Technical Analysis

Bitcoin has a clear rising market trend in the medium-to-long term; this
signals a stronger rate of growth (which is impressive), but this
positive development might result in short-term corrections. There isn’t
any resistance in the BTC price chart, and there is an indication of
further rise. In case there is a negative reaction, BTC has support at
19,000. The cryptocurrency’s short-term momentum is very positive, with
a [Relative Strength Index](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/relative-strength-index.html) (RSI) of more than 70. This shows that
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s have increasing optimism and that there should be a further
price increase for BTC. Yet, a high RSI with big cryptoassets might also
be a sign that the cryptocurrency is overbought – and when this is the
case, there is a chance of a downwards reaction if the indicator breaks
below the 70-level upside down. Overall, though, BTC is assessed to be
technically positive across the medium-long term.

## Weekly Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis as of 01.03.2021

The [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) BTCUSD price chart displays the initial leg of the simple
upward zigzag (A)-(B)-(C) currently unfolding. The bullish impulse (A),
which has been unfolding for more than four years, must have completed.
The bearish correction(B) has just started developing. The first leg of
the (B) wave should be unfolding as a double zigzag. Let us analyze the
market structure in more detail in the eight-hour timeframe.

Within the assumed double zigzag [w]-[x]-[y], the first motive wave [w]
has completed. Therefore the market should be rising in the bullish
linking wave [x] over the next few days. The [x] wave could end at a
level of 54500.00. Next, the market should turn down and start forming
the final motive wave [y]. An approximate trajectory of the Bitcoin
future price movement is outlined in the chart.

## Bitcoin Price Prediction in 2025

What applies to the weather forecast also applies to Bitcoin. The
further you look into the future, the more difficult it will be to make
a prediction. In 2025, the world may look very different from what we
now sketch. Nevertheless, we make an attempt. What will 2025 bring for
Bitcoin?

Many analysts agree that Bitcoin does not take the middle ground. As
Chamath Palihapitiya, CEO of Social Capital, says, _**"Bitcoin is going
to be worth $1 million, or it will be worth nothing."**_

We do not dare to make an exact prediction of the price of Bitcoin in
2025. The Bitcoin price simply depends on too many factors. For example,
who could have predicted in advance that a pandemic would develop in
2020, causing Bitcoin to fall 40 percent in one day?

We can, however, look at the long-term price development. And at the
moment, things are still looking good for [bitcoin](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-for-bitcoin/). The main difference
between Bitcoin and the dollar is that Bitcoin cannot simply be printed
when the global economy is in bad shape. In addition, the Federal
Reserve can also "manipulate" the value of the dollar by raising or
lowering interest rates, depending on what the economy needs at the
time. The result: inflation.

New Bitcoins, on the other hand, are issued at a predetermined rate.
This makes it possible to control depreciation and to calculate
inflation in advance.

Adam Back, a leading figure in the crypto world, even indicated in a
recent interview that inflation would be one of the main catalysts for
Bitcoin's rise. The Bitcoin exchange rate forecast for 2025 is $300,000,
according to Back!

In the coming years (and perhaps decades), the effective value of the
dollar will continue to decline as more money is printed. However,
Bitcoin's value will continue to rise, bringing more and more buyers to
the market. The demand then rises faster than the supply so that the
price of Bitcoin continues to grow.

## Bitcoin Historical Price Changes

Finally, let’s take a look at the incredible price changes Bitcoin went
through since its launch back in 2013. Analyzing such [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) price
charts may come in handy when making price predictions:



## Is Bitcoin a Good Investment?

The digital currency [Bitcoin][1] has risen above $30,000 for the first
time on Saturday, January 2nd, and then even hit the level of $34,000.
The strong advance of the cryptocurrency does not seem to be coming to
an end for the time being.

Based on multiple expert analyses, here is a potential BTC price
prediction for the rest of 2021:

Month| Open| Min-Max| Close| Total,%  
---|---|---|---|---  
 **2021**  
Jan| 28,994.01| 29036-49873| 46204| 59.1%  
Feb| 46204| 45698-61336| 53597| 84.5%  
Mar| 53597| 53597-66525| 62173| 114%  
Apr| 62173| 62173-77169| 72121| 148%  
May| 72121| 72121-89516| 83660| 188%  
Jun| 83660| 71211-83660| 76571| 164%  
Jul| 76571| 74226-85400| 79813| 175%  
Aug| 79813| 79813-99064| 92583| 219%  
Sep| 92583| 83230-95760| 89495| 208%  
Oct| 89495| 89495-104769| 97915| 237%  
Nov| 97915| 97915-121532| 113581| 291%  
Dec| 113581| 88729-113581| 95408| 228%  
  
Back to the present: after reaching the $30,000 milestone, the value of
the digital currency increased further almost immediately. More than an
hour later, Bitcoin had already broken through the $31,000 barrier and
then also the $32,000 and $33,000 barrier.

On Sunday, January 3rd, Bitcoin was above $34,000. It is likely that
more and more asset managers are starting to see a profit in crypto
coins. Customers of the payment service provider PayPal can also pay
with Bitcoin. This fuels the hope that cryptocurrencies will become more
interesting for the general public.

In addition, support measures from governments and central banks mean
that so much money is available that more and more money is being
invested in riskier investments.

Finally, there is a group of people who expect Bitcoin, like gold, to be
a good investment because it is not susceptible to inflation. The
current advance started last year. The digital currency then roughly
quadrupled in value, according to data from [Coinmarketcap](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/coinmarketcap-creator/).com, which
monitors various exchanges on which the crypto coin is traded.
