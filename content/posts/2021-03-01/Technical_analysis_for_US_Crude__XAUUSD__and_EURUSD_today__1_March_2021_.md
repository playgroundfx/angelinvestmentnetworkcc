Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 01.03.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

Last Friday, the short-term trend in the EURUSD pair reversed down. As a
result, the Target Zone [1.2082 - 1.2066] was immediately reached.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

Last week, a trading recommendation for selling oil worked out when the
Additional Zone [62.57 - 62.44] was broken out. Take Profit in the
Intermediary Zone [61.44 - 61.22] was taken.

The reaction to the short-term uptrend's key support test followed
immediately - the price rose and stopped in the resistance zone, the
Additional Zone [62.48 - 62.36]. Today consider new oil sales in AZ to
update Friday low.

A breakout of the IZ and closing of the US trading session below are
required to reverse the trend down. For oil purchases, it is necessary
to break out the level of 62.51 and consolidate the price within one or
two trading sessions higher.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

Sell according to the pattern in Additional Zone [62.48 - 62.36].
TakeProfit: 61.22. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

After reaching all possible targets within the short-term downtrend,
gold went into correction and is currently approaching the trend key
resistance [1777 - 1772]. After testing the trend border, look for a
pattern to open a new sale to update the Friday low.

To buy the precious metal, a breakout of the Intermediary Zone and
closing of the US trading session higher are required. In this case, the
target for purchases will be the upper Target Zone [1838 - 1827].

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

Sell according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone [1777 - 1772].
TakeProfit: 1718. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

Last Friday, the short-term trend in the EURUSD pair reversed down. As a
result, the Target Zone [1.2082 - 1.2066] was immediately reached.

If you remember, February 26's price forecast suggested the euro sale in
the Intermediary Zone [1.2162 - 1.2154] with a stop at 1.2184. As a
result, this sale was profitable.

Now, the euro price is correcting and approaching the local resistance
of the Additional Zone [1.2106 - 1.2102]. After testing the zone, look
for a sell pattern to update the Friday low.

If the Additional Zone is broken out, then the correction will continue
in order to test the new trend line [1.2150 - 1.2142].

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

  1. Sell according to the pattern in Additional Zone [1.2106 - 1.2102]. TakeProfit: 1.2063. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. Sell according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone [1.2150 - 1.2142]. TakeProfit: 1.2063. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.
