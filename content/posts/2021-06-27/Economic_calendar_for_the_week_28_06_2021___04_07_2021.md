Economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the week 28.06.2021 – 04.07.2021Jana Kane

##  **Review of the main events of the Forex economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the
next trading week (28.06.2021 – 04.07.2021)**

 **Trading on key Forex [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/): next week we expect the publication of
important macro statistics from Germany, China, the UK, Eurozone, Japan,
the US, and Australia.**

American major stock indexes rose last week. The industrial DJIA rose
3.7%, thus fully recovering from losses incurred in the previous week,
while the high-tech NASDAQ100 and the broad market S&P 500 index renewed
record highs. The DXY dollar index ended last week in negative territory
after a significant increase a week earlier, declining by 0.5% and again
falling below 92.00.

It seems that the head of the Fed Jerome Powell still managed to
reassure [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s and stop the strengthening of the dollar. Speaking
last Tuesday in the US Congress, he reiterated that the first priority
of the Fed is to support the US economy and labor market badly affected
by the pandemic. The rise in inflation, in his opinion, is a secondary,
albeit no less important problem.

He stressed that the Fed will not rush to tighten monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/),
relying on inflation alone, noting that the state of the labor market is
the main marker of the situation in the country's economy. And only with
the cumulative dynamics of these indicators (inflation growth and full
recovery of the labor market) the central bank can begin to change the
parameters of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).

Thus, the official position of the Fed leaders remained the same.
Central bankers want to push the economy closer to peak employment and
sustain a 2.0% annual inflation rate before phasing out asset purchases.
According to them, these goals must be achieved before the regulator
moves to raise rates.

Optimism still prevails on global stock exchanges, associated with
expectations of a further recovery in the global economy, both against
the backdrop of the unfolding vaccination against coronavirus in Europe
and North America, and the extra-soft [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the world's largest
central banks.

Next week, financial market participants will pay attention to the
publication of important macro statistics from Germany, China, the UK,
Eurozone, Japan, the US, and Australia. But the key event will be the
publication of monthly data from the US labor market on Friday.

 **Traders should pay attention to the publication of the following
macro indicators:**

 ***during the coming week, new events may be added to the [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) and
/ or some scheduled events may be canceled**

 ****GMT time**

###  **Monday, June 28**

No important macro statistics planned to be released.

###  **Tuesday, June 29**

###  **12:00 EUR Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) in Germany
(preliminary release)**

This index is published by the EU Statistical Office and is calculated
on the basis of a statistical method agreed between all EU countries. It
is an indicator for assessing inflation and is used by the Governing
Council of the ECB to assess the level of price stability. A positive
result strengthens the EUR, a negative one weakens it.

Preliminary forecast for June: +2.1% (against +2.4% in May, +2.1% in
April, +2.0% in March, +1.6% in January and February, -0.7 % in December
and negative values ​​in the second half of 2020) in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/). If
the data turn out to be better than the forecast, the euro may
strengthen in the short term. The growth of the indicator is a positive
factor for the euro. The data suggests increasing inflationary pressures
in Germany. The data worse than the forecast and the previous value will
negatively affect the euro.

###  **Wednesday, June 30**

###  **01:00 CNY China Services and Manufacturing PMIs from the China
Federation of Logistics and Purchasing (CFLP)**

These indicators assess the state of the services sector and the
manufacturing sector in the Chinese economy. A result above 50 is
considered positive and strengthens the yuan. Previous PMI values ​​for
the services sector: 55.2 in May, 56.3 in March, 51.4 in February, 52.4
in January. The indicator is above 50, which is likely to have a
positive effect on the yuan quotes, even with a slight relative decline.
If the indicator is below 50, the yuan will be under pressure and likely
to decline. Forecast for June: 52.7.

Previous PMI values ​​for the manufacturing sector: 51.0 in May, 51.9 in
March, 50.6 in February, 51.3 in January.

The relative growth of the index and the indicator above the value of 50
should have a positive effect on the CNY. The data above 50 indicates an
increase in activity, which has a positive effect on the quotes of the
national currency. In the opposite case, and if the indicator is below
50, the yuan will be under pressure and probably will decrease. Forecast
for June: 50.7.

###  **06:00 GBP UK 1Q GDP (final estimate)**

GDP is considered to be an indicator of the overall health of the
British economy. The upward trend in GDP is considered positive for the
GBP. The UK's GDP was one of the highest in the world until 2016, when
the Brexit referendum was held. Afterwards its growth slowed down, and
with the onset of the global coronavirus pandemic, the growth rate of
British GDP went into negative territory altogether.

A preliminary estimate indicated a drop of -1.5% (despite the forecast
of +0.5%) in the 1st quarter of 2021 (after a drop of -19.8% in the 2nd
quarter and an increase of +1.3% in the 4th quarter of 2020). The main
factors that can force the Bank of England to keep rates low are weak
GDP and labor market growth, as well as low consumer spending. If the
GDP data turns out to be worse than the first estimate, it will put
downward pressure on the pound. Strong GDP report will strengthen the
pound.

###  **09:00 EUR Consumer price index. Core CPI (preliminary release)**

Consumer Price Index (CPI) is published by Eurostat and measures the
price change of a selected basket of goods and services over a given
period. The index is a key indicator for assessing inflation and changes
in purchasing habits. A positive result strengthens the EUR, a negative
one weakens it. At the end of 2020, the CPI index fell by -0.3%, which
indicates low inflationary pressures and even a slowdown in inflation.
Forecast for June 2021: +1.9% (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) against +2.0% in May,
+1.3% in March, +0.9% in January and February. If the data turns out to
be worse than the forecast, the euro may drop sharply in the short term.
Data better than the forecast and / or the previous value may strengthen
the euro in the short term. Recall that the target level of consumer
inflation by the ECB is slightly below 2.0%.

Core Consumer Price Index (Core CPI) determines the change in prices of
a selected basket of goods and services for a given period and is a key
indicator for assessing inflation and changes in consumer preferences.
Food and energy have been excluded from this indicator to provide a more
accurate estimate. A high result strengthens the EUR, and a low result
weakens it. Core CPI rose +1.0% in May 2021, +0.7% in April (YoY) after
more modest values ​​of +0.2% between September and December 2020. If
the data for June turn out to be worse than the previous value or
forecast, this may negatively affect the euro. If the data turn out to
be better than the forecast or the previous value, the euro is likely to
react with an increase in quotations, but only in the short term. Core
inflation in the Eurozone remains low, which is a negative factor for
the euro. Forecast for June: +0.9%.

###  **12:15** **USD ADP National Employment Report**

Typically, the ADP's private sector employment report has a strong
impact on the market and dollar quotes. An increase in the value of this
indicator has a positive effect on the dollar. The US private sector
workforce growth is expected to be +600,000 in June (against an increase
of 978,000 in May, 742,000 in April, 517,000 in March, 117,000 in
February, 174,000 in January, a drop of -123,000 in December). The
relative growth of the indicator may have a positive effect on the
dollar quotes, while the relative decline in the indicator will affect
them negatively. Therefore, the market reaction may be negative, and the
dollar may decline if the data turns out to be worse than forecast.

Millions of Americans have previously been laid off due to the
coronavirus pandemic and related quarantine measures. The bulk of
layoffs were concentrated in tourism and retail. Other important sectors
of the economy were also affected. ADP previously reported that the most
significant drop in employment was recently noted in the construction
and financial services sectors.

Although the ADP report does not directly correlate with the official US
Department of Labor data on the labor market, which will be released on
Friday, however, the ADP report is often a harbinger of it, having a
noticeable impact on the market.

###  **23:50 JPY Tankan Large Manufacturing Index**

This index reflects general business conditions for large manufacturing
companies in Japan and is an indicator of the current state of Japan's
export-oriented economy, which is heavily dependent on the industrial
sector.

Rising values ​​and the value of the indicator above 0 (zero - the
middle line) is a positive factor for the JPY, and the value of the
indicator below 0 is negative.

According to the forecast, the index value is expected to be 15 (for the
2nd quarter of 2021) after rising to a value of 4 in the 1st quarter of
2021 and falling to -10 in the 4th quarter (-27 and -34 in the 3rd and
2- m quarters of 2020, respectively), which is likely to support the
yen, but above all Japanese stock indices.

###  **Thursday, July 1**

###  **01:30 AUD Balance of trade**

The indicator (balance of trade) assesses the ratio between the volume
of Australia's exports and imports. Growth in exports from Australia
leads to an increase in the trade surplus, which has a positive impact
on the AUD. Previous value A$ 8.028 billion (April), A$ 5.574 billion
(March), A$ 7.529 billion (February). A decrease in the trade surplus
may negatively affect the Australian dollar. Conversely, the growing
trade surplus is a positive factor for the AUD. Forecast for May: A$
10,000 billion.

###  **10:00 (preliminary time) OPEC meeting**

At this meeting, OPEC together with other major oil-producing countries
must decide on production volumes for the next time period. If a
decision is made to limit / reduce production volumes, this will have a
positive effect on oil prices. The opposite decision will have,
accordingly, a negative impact on oil prices. The parameters of the new
agreement on production volumes will also matter.

###  **14:00 USD Manufacturing PMI (from ISM)**

Published by the Institute for Supply Management (ISM), the US
Manufacturing PMI is an important indicator of the health of the US
economy as a whole. A result above 50 is seen as positive and
strengthens the USD, one below 50 as negative for the US dollar.
Forecast: 61.5 in June (against 61.2 in May, 60.7 in April, 64.7 in
March, 60.8 in February, 58.7 in January, 60.7 in December). The index
is above the 50 level and has a relatively high value, which is likely
to support the dollar. The data above the value of 50 indicates the
acceleration of activity, which has a positive effect on the quotes of
the national currency. If the indicator falls below the forecast and,
especially, below the value of 50, the dollar may sharply weaken in the
short term.

###  **Friday, July 2**

###  **06:00 EUR Retail sales in Germany**

Retail sales is the main indicator of consumer spending in Germany
showing changes in retail sales. A high result strengthens the euro, and
vice versa, a low result weakens it. Forecast: -2.0% (+10.1% yoy) in May
against -2.0% (+4.4% yoy) in April, +7.7% (+11% yoy) ) in March, +1.2%
(-9.0% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) in February, -4.5% (-8.7% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) in
January, -9.6% (+1.5 % in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) in December, +1.9% (+5.6% in
annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) in November.

The data indicate the instability of the recovery of this sector of the
German economy, including due to lockdowns due to coronavirus. Better-
than-expected data is likely to have a positive effect on the euro, but
in the short term.

###  **12:30 USD Average hourly wages. Non-farm payrolls. Unemployment
rate**

These are the most important indicators of the state of the labor market
in the United States in June. Forecast: +0.4% (against +0.5% in May,
+0.7% in April, -0.1% in March, +0.2% in January and February, +0.8% in
December , +0.3% in November) / +0.675 million (against +0.559 million
in May, +0.266 million in April, +0.916 million in March, +0.379 in
February, +0.049 million in January, -0.140 million in December, +0.245
million in November, +0.638 million in October, +1.763 million in July
and -20.687 million in April 2020) / 5.6% (against 5.8% in May, 6.1% in
April, 6.0 % in March, 6.2% in February, 6.3% in January, 6.7% in
December and November, 6.9% in October, 13.3% in May and 14.7% in April
2020), respectively.

In general, the indicators can be described as encouraging. The data
speaks of continued improvement in the US labor market after plummeting
in the first half of 2020. Prior to the coronavirus, the US labor market
remained strong, signaling the stability of the American economy and
supporting dollar quotes.

It is often difficult to predict the market reaction to the publication
of indicators since many indicators for previous periods are subject to
revision. Now it will be even more difficult to do this, because the
economic situation in the United States and many other large economies
remains controversial due to the coronavirus. In any case, when data
from the US labor market is published, a surge in volatility is expected
in trading not only in the USD, but throughout the entire financial
market. The most cautious [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s might choose to stay out of the
market during this time frame.
