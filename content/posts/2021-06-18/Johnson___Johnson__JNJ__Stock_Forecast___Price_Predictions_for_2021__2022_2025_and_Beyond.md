## Key Factors That Affect Johnson & Johnson Stock Price in 2021 &
Beyond

There are common factors that impact stock performance, including
earnings reports, internal company events, industry [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/), and global
market conditions. We will consider what could affect the Johnson and
Johnson stock forecast precisely.

### Vaccine

Johnson & Johnson has been increasing its number of collaborations with
different companies to develop a vaccine. Although the enterprise went
through difficulties in the manufacturing and shipping of the vaccine,
it's still among the leading producers. For instance, in April 2021, the
FDA advised a halt in the usage of the J&J Covid vaccine after 6 female
recipients experienced blood clots, and 1 died. Although stocks declined
by 3% during intraday trading, the price started rising fast. This
confirms that the position of vaccine producer is stronger than any
challenges. Thus, the stock price is expected to keep rising.

### Lawsuits

The case about talcum powder that causes cancer began in 2018 but has
been still affecting the company. Shares are dramatically affected by
[news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) regarding such cases. As the firm owns various subsidiaries, it's
almost impossible to avoid such cases in the future.

### Right Strategy

The company bets on innovation and persistently spends funds on research
and development. Around a quarter of J&J's annual sales is generated by
products launched in the previous 5 years.

Also, Johnson & Johnson is a parent company of many popular brands.
Thus, wise investments continue boosting the company's revenue and
attracting new [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s.

### Revenue

The quarterly revenue constantly beats the market's expectations. It's a
vital factor that triggers a stock rise even in challenging times. There
is no reason to expect a decline in the company's growth.

How much will JNJ stock be worth in 10 years? The source doesn't provide
a longer-term Johnson and Johnson stock prediction as such long
forecasts are subject to constant changes. The stock market is highly
volatile; that's why all long-term price projections should be viewed
skeptically.

## A Price Timeline: JNJ Outlook

Price [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) is a vital part of both short- and long-term prediction.
Historical stock’s moves give clues on the upcoming price direction.
Even last month’s fluctuations can predict a future price.

If you look at the chart of [JNJ stocks][2], you will see that the
overall uptrend began in 2012. Since then, the price has been climbing.
The price managed to set a new all-time high on May 20, 2021 when it
peaked at 171.07 US dollars. If analysts' Johnson and Johnson share
price forecasts are correct, the bullish trend will continue, and the
price will set new highs soon.

We will have a look at the price movements since 2018. The first half of
the year was negative for JNJ shares. Why was [J&J's stock][2] down? As
Johnson & Johnson is a consumer staples company, the overall market
trend pulled its stocks down. In 2018, changing consumer tastes lowered
the company’s stable income, while rising interest rates made high
dividend payouts less attractive.

However, the most harmful effect was caused by allegations that J&J's
baby talcum powder caused cancer. The stocks plunged after the court
claimed $4.7 billion payments to those who said that the company's baby
powder was the cause of their cancer.

Still, the price recovered soon after the company confirmed its decision
to appeal the court adjudication. Additionally, the company reported
strong second-quarter revenue.

In 2019, the price moved mostly sideways. That year, the litigation over
opioids and baby powder were key price drivers. J&J faced personal
injury claims by more than 100,000 plaintiffs. However, better-than-
expected earnings reports and growth in pharmaceutical sales supported
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) sentiment.

In summer, stocks suffered as a court accused the company of
intentionally playing down the dangers and oversold the benefits of
opioids. In August, in the first trial for the destruction caused by
prescription painkillers, the court ordered Johnson & Johnson to pay the
state $572 million. In October, the price started recovering.

It's not a secret why JNJ stocks plunged in February-March 2020. The
Covid pandemic affected the whole stock market. However, the shares
rapidly recovered. The company started working on its own Covid-19
vaccine.

In February, the firm launched a clinical study in cooperation with
Apple to define whether the Heartline™ Study app on iPhone, and the ECG
app and irregular rhythm notification on Apple Watch could reduce the
probability of stroke and raise health outcomes with earlier detection
of atrial fibrillation.

In the past year, the company had to remove its baby powder brand in the
US and Canada due to "changes in consumer habits" and "misinformation
around the product's safety." In November, the company failed to reverse
a $2 billion verdict related to asbestos in its baby and other talc
products. However, the company's cash balance and investments helped it
stay afloat even in such a difficult year.

In 2021, stocks continued rising. Although Johnson and Johnson had to
temporarily halt shipping of the coronavirus vaccine in March due to the
spoiling of 15 million doses, it didn't affect the share price.
