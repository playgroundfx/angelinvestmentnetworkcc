XAUUSD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 18.06.2021 –
25.06.2021Alex Geuta

 **Main scenario:** long positions will be relevant above the level of
1674.46 with a target of 1958.14 – 2016.10 after correction.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
1674.46 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of
1568.91 – 1447.92.

 **Analysis:** an ascending third wave of larger degree (3) formed on
the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame, and a descending correction developed as wave (4),
supposedly. The fifth wave (5) appears to be forming on the H4 time
frame, with the first wave of smaller degree 1 of (5) formed inside. On
the H1 time frame, a descending correction is nearing completion as wave
2 of (5), with wave c of 2 forming inside. If the presumption is
correct, the pair will continue to rise to the levels of 1958.14 –
2016.10 after correction. The level of 1674.46 is critical in this
scenario as the breakout will enable the pair to continue declining to
the levels of 1568.91 – 1447.92.
