EURUSD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 18.06.2021 –
25.06.2021Alex Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 1.2149 with a target of 1.1600 – 1.1489.

 **Alternative scenario:** ****breakout and consolidation above the
level of 1.2149 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of
1.2500 – 1.2600.

 **Analysis:** Daily time frame: presumably, the first wave of larger
degree 1 of (3) formed, and a downside correction is forming as wave 2
of (3). Apparently, wave a of 2 and an ascending wave b of 2 formed on
the H4 time frame. A descending wave c of 2 is developing on the H1 time
frame, with the third wave of smaller degree (iii) of c developing
inside. If the presumption is correct, the pair will continue to drop to
the levels of 1.1600 – 1.1489. The level of 1.2149 is critical in this
scenario. Its breakout will allow the pair to continue rising to the
levels of 1.2500 – 1.2600.
