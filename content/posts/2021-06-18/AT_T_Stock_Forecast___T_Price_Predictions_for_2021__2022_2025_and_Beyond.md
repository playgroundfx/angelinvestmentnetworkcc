AT&T Stock Forecast: Will Shares Ever Recover?Jana Kane

AT&T is the world's telecom giant. However, its shares seem to be
undervalued. If we look at the chart, we will see only a downtrend. Will
the T stocks ever recover? What is the future of [AT&T][1]? Let's
discover AT&T's prospects for the next 10 years.

The article covers the following subjects:

## A Brief Overview of AT&T's Shares

AT&T Inc. (SBC Communications Inc. until November 2005) is a well-known
provider of telco, media, and technology services. The company's

  * AT&T is a parent company of DirecTV, SKY, and Unefon in the Latin America segment. The segment includes video entertainment, audio programming, postpaid, and prepaid wireless services.

Here is some data on [T stocks][2] (New York Stock Exchange: T):

  * Shares outstanding: 7.188 billion

  * Public float: 7.13 billion

  * P/E ratio: N/A

  * Payout ratio: 65.82% (based on this year's estimates)

reverse split. It meant that for each 50,000 shares pre-split, the
shareholder now owned 24,875 shares. For instance, a 2,000 share
position pre-split became a 995 position.

How much is AT&T stock? The stock price today 19.06.2021 is 28.62 US
dollars.

## Key Factors That Affect T Stock Price in 2021 & Beyond

When trying to predict a company's stock direction, it's worth
considering basic factors. They include financial outlook, earnings
reports, the industry's environment, and internal company [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/). However,
every firm has certain factors that will make sense only for its future.

### Poor Acquisitions

In 2015, the company merged with DirecTV. Since then, the company has
been suffering losses only. However, it refuses to fully divest the
subsidiary. Additionally, analysts and [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s blame the company for
the lack of transformational ability. The company focuses on losing
businesses and avoiding its core business of telecommunication services.

If the company doesn't get rid of unprofitable businesses, its shares
will continue falling.

### Challenging Competition

Focusing on weak DirecTV, the company doesn't pay enough attention to 5G
and an expansion into streaming services. Although the Ookla Speedtest
recognized AT&T's network as the fastest for both 4G and 5G, its
competitors, Verizon and T-Mobile, spend lots of money on upgrading
their speed and quality. It will increase price competition. If the
enterprise doesn't refocus its business strategy, a new outlook on its
stock rate won’t take place. However, the enterprise always works on its
services, including a refund [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).

### Expensive Dividends

[AT&T][2] pays 63% of free cash flow in dividends, while its rivals
spend less. Verizon pays about 50%, and T-Mobile doesn't pay dividends
at all. Of course, it makes a firm's shares attractive for [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s.
Just to compare, T shareholders earn $2.08 per share, and the average
yield is about 6.6%, while S&P 500's average yield is 1.4%.

This situation is uncertain. On the one hand, good dividends will
attract more [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s, increasing the interest in the company and
boosting its stocks. On the other hand, high payments affect the
company's finances. For instance, the firm has limited funds to improve
the 5G segment. In 2021, the estimated CapEx is in the USD 21 billion
range.

At the same time, the company’s CEO claimed there is no need for
dividend cuts for the growth of funds.

### HBO Outlook

In 2021, the company is going to expand HBO Max. In June, the company is
expected to launch 39 Latin American and Caribbean markets along with a
service’s ad-supported version in the US. 21 markets should be launched
in the second half of 2021. The expansion will result in 67 million and
70 million total HBO and HBO Max subscribers.

If the company succeeds, the stocks will move up.

## AT&T Stock Projections for 2021: Analysts’ Recommendations

Will AT&T stock go up in 2021? The average 12-month forecast by [15 Wall
Street analysts][3] is $31.67. The maximum price is set at $38.00; the
lowest AT&T stock price target is $25.00. Although 8 analysts set a
“Buy” rating, the average rating is “Hold”, as there are 3 “Sell”
ratings and 4 “Hold” ratings.

### Morgan Stanley

 ****

Analysts at Morgan Stanley lowered the target price to $32 from $34,
maintaining the “Hold” rating.

### John Hodulik, UBS

John Hodulik at UBS raised the price target to $35 from $32, upgrading
the rating to “Buy” from “Neutral”.

### Jonathan Chaplin, New Street Research

Jonathan Chaplin at New Street Research raised the rating to “Buy” from
“Neutral” and kept the future price target at $35.

### Frank Louthan, Raymond James

Raymond James, represented by Frank Louthan, kept the “Buy” rating
unchanged and raised the potential price to $33 from $32.

### Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft

Analysts at Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft raised the price to $34
from $31 without rating.

## Technical Analysis of AT&T Shares

Is now a good time to buy AT&T stock? Let’s consider price dynamics.

The technical analysis looks more optimistic. On the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) chart of [T
stocks][2], the price is trading sideways. The [MACD indicator](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/macd.html) has almost
crossed the 0 level upside. At the same time, the [Awesome Oscillator](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/awesome-oscillator.html) may
form a hidden bullish divergence with the price chart if the price keeps
rising. Both indicators provide odds on the short-term upward movement.
Resistance levels are placed at $30 and $31. The support levels are a
range of $28.50-$27.90 and $26.50. Stop-loss levels can’t be defined.

However, on the weekly chart, Moving Averages and oscillators signal
selling pressure. So, stock performance may change soon. Classic weekly
pivot levels are:

S3 — 4.52

S2 — 17.99

S1 — 23.38

P — 31.46

R1 — 36.85

R2 — 44.93

R3 — 58.40

## AT&T Stock Forecast for 2022

Wallet Investor doesn’t expect long-term growth. Starting the year at
$28.570, it will drop to USD 26.907 by the end of December next year. A
narrow price gap between minimum and maximum rates signals low
volatility, which is positive for long-term [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s. However, a
constant decline doesn't predict profit from such investments.

It’s worth remembering that such long-term forecasts are subject to
constant changes and a low level of accuracy as the stock market is
highly volatile.

## AT&T’s Historical Price Fluctuations: Timeline

Historical accuracy plays an important role in price projections. The
price [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) shows what events affected the stock's rate in the past.
As [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) repeats itself, it's worth knowing prior events to predict
future stock quotes. Let’s have a look at past stock performance.
Historically, even last month’s data can provide ideas on the future
direction.

On the week-period timeframe, we can notice that the overall downtrend
started in the middle of June 2016. If we look precisely at the price
movements during 2016, we will notice high volatility caused by many
changes in the company's business. Why was AT&T's stock down?

In the middle of the year, the price was trading near $43. After that,
it plunged. A drastic fall happened in October 2016, when the enterprise
announced it would buy Time Warner. However, the rate managed to recover
by the end of December. The financial outlook wasn't fully positive, but
the successful integration of DirecTV, which led to big gains in that
service, pushed the stock price up. ****

In 2017, the stocks were mostly down as the company suffered tough
competition. Sprint Corp planned to partner up with Comcast Corporation
and Charter Communications, Inc., which would create a more challenging
competitive environment. Also, difficulties in the wireless services
industry were putting pressure on the company. By the end of the year,
the price was near $40.

2018 was a bad year for AT&T, Inc. During the first half of 2018, AT&T’s
share price dropped by 17.4%. The company's weak quarterly revenue, the
Department of Justice's antitrust suit that would determine the legality
of the Time Warner merger, and uncertainties about the profitability of
the merger put pressure on the stocks. Although the court approved the
merger without any requirements to sell off assets like DirecTV or the
Turner networks, stocks continued losing their value. Later on, the
corporation struggled in the satellite television business. In the third
quarter, 359,000 customers left DirecTV. At the end of December, the
price was $28.

2019 was more promising for the share price. That year AT&T was among
the most popular companies for stock dividends. The enterprise was still
blamed for expensive mergers with DirecTV and Time Warner. However, it
managed to reassure [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s. AT&T promised to avoid new acquisitions
and get rid of unprofitable non-core businesses. During the year, the
firm was able to return to $40.

The corporation would set a new all-time high (the last time the all-
time high of 59.19 was reached on July 16, 1999), but the coronavirus
pandemic upset its plans. By March 23, the stock rate was near $26.
During the rest of 2020 and the first half of 2021, the stocks were
trading sideways within a narrow range of $27-$32.

The company’s corporate debt in December 2020 equaled the data of the
previous year. Annualized Debt-to-EBITDA as of the quarter ended in
March 2021 was 2.45.

## Is It Good to Invest in AT&T (T)?

T shares aren’t among the top stocks to invest in. [AT&T][2] is a
popular brand in the telecom sector. Still, the company can't get rid of
losing businesses and focus on primary segments. It affects its
financial position and attractiveness for [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s. That’s why its
future growth is limited.

The price expectations are weak. According to analysts and market
experts, the company's shares will lose value for the next 10 years.
