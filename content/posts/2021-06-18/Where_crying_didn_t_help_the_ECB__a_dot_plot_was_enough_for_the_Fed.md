Fed changes diagnosis. Review as of 18.06.2021Dmitri Demidenko

Where crying didn't help the ECB, a dot plot was enough for the Fed

## Financial markets paid too much for believing in Fed's passivity

Never argue with a doctor, or your diagnosis may change. Up to the
middle of June, markets believed the inflation boom was temporary and
the Fed would remain passive for a long time. However, the "doctor"
changed the diagnosis all the same. The Central bank now expects the
economy will get stronger and is ready to raise rates as early as 2023.
Twice. Even though Jerome Powell repeated many times that a "dot plot"
wasn't a call for action as it didn't express the whole FOMC's opinion,
the [EURUSD][1] bulls had to capitulate.

A stable person is a very convenient shooting target. The Fed was so
successful in persuading [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s of its stable passivity that aiming
-- creating an efficient strategy -- seemed to be as easy as pie. So why
shouldn't we sell the dollar when no other bank can afford to be more
peaceful than the Fed? That's what hedge funds and other speculators
have been doing since April -- selling the greenback and buying the
Canadian dollar, the Norwegian krone, and the British pound

The euro was one of the leaders in that race, although Frankfurt didn't
want to voice its willingness to normalize monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), as Ottawa,
Oslo, and London did. The ECB could only cry quietly, in the form of
verbal interventions by Governing Council's members, or loudly, in the
form of Christine Lagarde's press conference following the ECB's meeting
in June.

> \- My son, why are you crying so loudly?

>

> \- I tried crying quietly, and nobody heard.

It turns out it all wasn't because of growing vaccination rates in the
EU, selling the first bonds backing the EU recovery fund, or
expectations of an economic boom in the eurozone after lockdowns. It's
because the USD is oversold amid the Fed's passive and transparent
stance. Unfortunately, your weapon may hurt you: the Fed promised to be
transparent and made [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s believe in its passivity. As a result,
financial markets exploded once they saw the Central bank waking up.

People's relationship with time is complicated. They don't know either
[how to](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-trading-how-to/) kill time or [how to](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-trading-how-to/) get more time. Projections for core PCE
inflation suggest Jerome Powell and his colleagues continue to believe
that the recent spike in inflation was temporary. Still, they prepared a
withdrawal route: if something goes wrong, the Fed is ready to step in.
The question is how long the Fed will remain patient. How long will it
tolerate CPI at 5% and more? Six months? Twelve months? Eighteen months?
Can the federal funds rate be raised as early as 2022? If so, should we
forget about EURUSD at 1.25?

Nevertheless, that won't happen soon. In 2022, the eurozone's economy
will be recovering faster than the US one. Will it be a reason for the
ECB to start a new life?

> \- I want to start a new life every day.

>

> \- What's the problem then?

>

> \- My old life.
