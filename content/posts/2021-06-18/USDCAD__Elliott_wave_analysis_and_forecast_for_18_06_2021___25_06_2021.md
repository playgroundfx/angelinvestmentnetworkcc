USDCAD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 18.06.2021 –
25.06.2021Alex Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider short positions below the level of 1.2712
with a target of 1.1850 – 1.1700 once correction is completed.

 **Alternative scenario:** ****breakout and consolidation above the
level of 1.2712 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of
1.2873 – 1.3405.

 **Analysis:** Daily time frame: wave (С) of 4 of larger degree
continues developing, with the third wave 3 of (C) formed inside. The
fifth wave v of 3 finished forming on the H4 time frame, with wave (v)
of v completed inside. On the H1 time frame, a descending correction
appears to have started forming as the fourth wave 4 of (C), with wave a
of 4 formed within. If the presumption is correct, the pair will
continue to fall to the levels of 1.1850 – 1.1700 once the correction is
over. The level of 1.2712 is critical in this scenario as a breakout
will enable the pair to continue rising to the levels of 1.2873 –
1.3405.
