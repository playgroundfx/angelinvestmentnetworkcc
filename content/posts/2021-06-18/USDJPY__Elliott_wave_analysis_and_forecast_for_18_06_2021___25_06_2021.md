USDJPY: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 18.06.2021 –
25.06.2021Alex Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions from corrections above the
level of 109.16 with a target of 112.00 – 113.50.

 **Alternative scenario:** ****breakout and consolidation below the
level of 109.16 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels
of 106.75 – 105.80.

 **Analysis:** Daily TM: apparently, a descending correction of larger
degree finished forming as wave B, and wave С started developing, with
the first wave (1) of С forming inside.

The third wave of smaller degree 3 of (1) continues developing on the H4
time frame, with wave i of 3 formed, a downside correction completed as
wave ii of 3, and wave iii of 3 developing inside. Apparently, wave
(iii) of iii is forming on the H1 time frame. If this assumption is
correct, the pair will continue to rise to 112.00 – 113.50. The level of
109.16 is critical in this scenario as the breakout will enable the pair
to continue declining to the levels of 106.75 – 105.80.
