USDCHF: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 18.06.2021 –
25.06.2021Alex Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions from corrections above the
level of 0.8922 with a target of 0.9476 – 0.9678.

 **Alternative scenario:** ****breakout and consolidation below the
level of 0.8922 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels
of 0.8754 – 0.8600.

 **Analysis:** Daily time frame: presumably, a descending first wave of
larger degree (1) of 5 formed and an ascending correction is now
developing as second wave (2) of 5. On the H4 time frame, wave A of (2)
was formed and wave B of (2) finished developing. Apparently, wave С of
(2) started developing on the H1 time frame, with the first wave of
smaller degree i of C forming inside. If this assumption is correct, the
pair will continue to rise to 0.9476 – 0.9678. The level of 0.8922 is
critical in this scenario. Its breakout will allow the pair to continue
falling to the levels of 0.8754 – 0.8600.
