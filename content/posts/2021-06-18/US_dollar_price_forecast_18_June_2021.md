Has dollar broken the trend? Forecast as of 18.06.2021Dmitri Demidenko

Bets on the Fed’s dovish stance were too high, and the mistake resulted
in the best two-day rally of the US dollar over the past fifteen months.
The euro crashed. Let us discuss the Forex outlook and make up a
[EURUSD][1] trading plan.

## Weekly US dollar fundamental forecast

The Fed is more concerned about stocks and bonds than currencies or
commodities. Therefore, Jerome Powell and his fellow central bankers
must be satisfied with the financial markets’ response to the revised
forecast for the federal funds rate. The US stock indexes have not
fallen significantly, and the 10-year Treasury yield is far from
breaking through May’s high, let alone April’s peak. The situation with
the US dollar is different. Before the FOMC June meeting, the USD had
been weakening over the past fifteen months. However, following the
Fed’s meeting, the dollar featured the best two-day rise for the same
period. Has the [EURUSD][2] uptrend broken down?

It seems to me that the US dollar downtrend was based on two drivers.
First, the growth gap between the United States and the rest of the
world should be narrowing as COVID-19 vaccines are actively introduced.
Second, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s believe that no central bank in the world can afford
to be more dovish than the Fed. The Fed has deprived the dollar bears of
both benefits. They raised the forecast for US GDP for 2021 to 7% and
signaled that the regulator would not remain passive indefinitely. The
US economy is still ahead of the rest of the world, and the Fed is not
willing to ignore the inflation surge to the highest levels since the
1990s.

The euro became one of the most hit currencies in Forex, dipping 1.8%
against the US dollar within two days, as the bets on the euro rally
have been too high and the divergence in the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) is obvious.
The Fed has already started discussing the potential tapering of the QE.
At the same time, European Central Bank chief economist Philip Lane
signaled that September might be too soon to start discussing shifting
away from current ultra-easy monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). By September, the US
central bankers must signal the reduction in asset purchases under the
$120-billion quantitative easing program.

Therefore, the bets on the Fed’s ultra-easy monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) have failed,
and the exiting of greenback shorts, being around three-month highs,
have sent the [EURUSD][2] down. As a result, many banks abandon their
bullish forecasts for the euro, suggesting that the single European
currency has become weak both technically and fundamentally. However,
some analysts prefer to wait until markets calm down to discuss the
euro-dollar further trend. Societe Generale indicated a target of 1.2
for EURUSD at the end of the year the next after the FOMC meeting.

### Weekly [EURUSD][2] trading plan

I believe that the trading situation on June 16-17 is an example of how
the expectations of a too excited crowd were not met. Investors are in a
panic now, exiting the trades. However, we can’t say that the euro
uptrend has been broken without further evidence. If the [EURUSD][2]
falls below 1.176-1.182, it will be an argument for the above
suggestion. Until then, I expect the price to stabilize or even go up
amid the dovish comments of the FOMC officials.
