Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 18.06.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

As part of a strong gold downtrend, the price reached Target Zone 3 1768
- 1763.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

Oil corrected to the short-term uptrend's key support zone 70.08 -
69.82. The price didn't break out the zone, therefore, the priority for
searching for purchases remains. Now the buyers' reaction to the test of
the zone can be seen. To form a buy pattern, it is necessary to break
out yesterday US trading session's high and consolidate the price
higher.

Oil sales require a trend reversal by breaking out level 69.23. In this
case, look for short trades with a target in the lower Target Zone 67.43
- 66.90.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

Buy according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 70.08 - 69.82.
TakeProfit: 72.57. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

As part of a strong gold downtrend, the price reached Target Zone 3 1768
- 1763. Sellers exited sales in the Target Zone 3, which led to a price
correction up. The target of the correction is the test of the
Intermediary Zone 1792 - 1789, which serves as the short-term
downtrend's border.

After the test of the Intermediary Zone, it will be profitable to look
for new sales according to the pattern. The target will be yesterday's
low.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

Sell according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 1792 - 1789.
TakeProfit: 1768. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

Yesterday, the euro reached Target Zone 2 1.1914 - 1.1896 within a
short-term downtrend. If the beforementioned TZ is broken out and the
price closes lower at the US trading session, the next target for sales
will be Gold Zone 2 1.1826 - 1.1817.

It is profitable to look for new euro sales at strong resistances
according to the pattern. Additional Zone 1.1940 - 1.1935 and
Intermediary Zone 1.1988 - 1.1979 are strong resistances. Take profit
for possible sales should be set at yesterday's low.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

  1. Sell according to the pattern in Additional Zone 1.1940 - 1.1935. TakeProfit: 1.1893. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. Sell according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 1.1988 - 1.1979. TakeProfit: 1.1893. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.
