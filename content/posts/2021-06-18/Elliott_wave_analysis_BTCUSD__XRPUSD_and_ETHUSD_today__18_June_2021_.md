Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 18.06.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

Bitcoin has started forming the final impulse in the corrective wave.
Ethereum and Ripple should be following corrective waves.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

The hourly BTCUSD price chart displays the extended corrective wave [2]
currently unfolding as a simple zigzag (A)-(B)-(C). Corrective wave (B)
of this zigzag has a complex structure of the double zigzag W-X-Y. There
is developing the impulse wave (C), namely, its final leg, as the first
four sub-waves look complete. The price should soon go up to a level of
44500.00. At this level, wave [2] will be 50% of wave [1].

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 37839.50, TP 44500.00

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

The XRPUSD chart displays the middle part of a large corrective pattern.
Most likely, there is forming a double zigzag, with the linking wave
developing inside. Wave (X) is composed of three sub-waves W-X-Y; the
first two sub-waves have completed, and the final wave Y is still
developing. The Y wave must end as a double zigzag [W]-[X]-[Y]. The
Ripple price should be rising in the final leg of this zigzag, sub-wave
[Y]. The market should go up to a level of 1.153, where wave (X) will be
38.2% of the motive wave (Y).

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] today:

Buy 0.837, TP 1.153

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

The ETHUSD market is forming corrective wave 2. This correction has a
complex structure and seems to be a triple zigzag [W]-[X]-[Y]-[X]-[Z].
There must have completed the second linking wave [X], which is also a
triple zigzag. There is unfolding the final wave [Z] as a double zigzag
(W)-(X)-(Y), which will be concluded by wave (Y). The Ethereum price
should go up to a level of 3027.43, where wave 2 will be 50% of impulse
1.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Buy 2336.48, TP 3027.43
