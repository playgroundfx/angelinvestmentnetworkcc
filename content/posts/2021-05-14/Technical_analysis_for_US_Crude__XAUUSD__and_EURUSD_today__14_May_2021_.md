Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

Yesterday was marked by a drop in oil prices. As part of the fall, the
price reached the Intermediary Zone 63.97 - 63.70, and the support level
of 63.91 was broken out.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

Yesterday was marked by a drop in oil prices. As part of the fall, the
price reached the Intermediary Zone 63.97 - 63.70, and the support level
of 63.91 was broken out. It can be assumed that the short-term trend has
reversed down, and now the target for sales is the lower Target Zone
61.31 - 60.78.

Today, it is profitable to look for oil sales either in the Additional
Zone 64.57 - 64.43 or in the Intermediary Zone 66.02- 65.76. Take a part
of the profit when the price breaks out yesterday's low.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

  1. Sell according to the pattern in Additional Zone 64.57 - 64.43. TakeProfit: 63.17, Target Zone 61.31 - 60.78. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. Sell according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 66.02- 65.76. TakeProfit: 63.17, Target Zone 61.31 - 60.78. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

At the moment, gold is trading in a short-term downtrend with the target
in the Target Zone 1800 - 1796. However, today began with a strong price
rise, within which the trend key resistance 1833 - 1831 was reached. So
far, the price didn't break out the resistance, but everything can
change during the day.

In case of a gold sell pattern formation, sell the precious metal. Take
a part of the profit at yesterday's low

If there is a breakout and a price consolidation above level 1833, then
from Monday, look for purchases with a target at the upper Target Zone
1858 - 1853.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

Sell according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 1833 - 1831.
TakeProfit: Target Zone 1800 - 1796. StopLoss: according to the pattern
rules.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

The euro is correcting up in the new downtrend. Now, traders are testing
the zone of good sell prices 1.2148 - 1.2095. It is profitable to look
for a sell pattern and sell the euro in this zone with the first target
at yesterday's low and the second target in the Target Zone 1.2005 -
1.1988.

It will be reasonable to buy the euro in case of the Intermediary Zone
1.2148 - 1.2139 breakout. Then the trend will reverse up again, and the
target will be the upper Target Zone 1.2245 - 1.2227.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

Open sell positions according to the pattern in 1.2148 - 1.2095.
TakeProfit: 1.2052, Target Zone 1.2093 - 1.2084. StopLoss: according to
the pattern rules.
