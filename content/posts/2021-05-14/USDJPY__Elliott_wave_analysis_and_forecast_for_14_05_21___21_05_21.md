USDJPY: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 14.05.21 – 21.05.21Alex
Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 110.93 with a target of 106.75 – 105.77.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
110.93 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 112.50 –
114.55.

 **Analysis:** Daily TM: apparently, a descending correction of larger
degree finished forming as wave B, and wave С started developing, with
the first wave (1) of С forming inside.

The third wave of smaller degree 3 of (1) continues developing on the H4
time frame, with wave i of 3 formed and downside correction developing
as wave ii of 3 inside. Apparently, wave (a) of ii formed and wave (b)
of ii is nearing completion on the H1 time frame. If the presumption is
correct, the pair will continue to fall to the levels of 106.75 – 105.77
after correction. The level of 110.93 is critical in this scenario as
the breakout will enable the pair to continue growing to the levels of
112.50 – 114.55.
