XAUUSD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 14.05.21 – 21.05.21Alex
Geuta

 **Main scenario:** long positions will be relevant above the level of
1742.01 with a target of 1877.16 – 1958.14 once the correction has
formed.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
1742.01 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of
1675.55 – 1650.00.

 **Analysis:** an ascending third wave of larger degree (3) formed on
the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame, and a descending correction developed as wave (4),
supposedly. The fifth wave (5) appears to be forming on the H4 time
frame, with the first wave of smaller degree 1 of (5) formed inside.
Supposedly, a downside correction is forming as wave 2 of (5) on the H1
time frame. If this assumption is correct, the pair will continue to
rise to the levels of 1877.16 – 1958.14 once the correction’s over. The
level of 1742.01 is critical in this scenario as the breakout will
enable the pair to continue declining to the levels of 1675.55 –
1650.00.
