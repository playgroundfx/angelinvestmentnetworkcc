USDCAD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 14.05.21 – 21.05.21Alex
Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions from corrections above the
level of 1.2044 with a target of 1.2361 – 1.2560.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
1.2044 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of 1.1850
– 1.1700.

 **Analysis:** wave (С) of 4 of larger degree continues developing on
the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame, with the third wave 3 of (C) formed inside. The
fifth wave v of 3 finished forming on the H4 time frame, with wave (v)
of v of smaller degree completed inside. Apparently, an ascending
correction is starting to develop as the fourth wave 4 of (C) on the H1
time frame. If the presumption is correct, the pair may be expected to
rise to the levels of 1.2361 – 1.2560. The level of 1.2044 is critical
in this scenario as its breakout will enable the pair to continue
declining to the levels of 1.1850 – 1.1700.
