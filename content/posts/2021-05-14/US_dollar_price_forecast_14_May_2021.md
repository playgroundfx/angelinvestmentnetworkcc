Dollar doesn’t control emotions. Forecast as of 14.05.2021Dmitri
Demidenko

The Fed will tolerate high inflation for at least three months before
starting to discuss tapering the QE. If so, the market's reaction to the
CPI looks too emotional. Investors need to calm down. How will it affect
the [EURUSD][1]? Let us discuss the Forex outlook and make up a trading
plan.

##  **Weekly US dollar fundamental forecast**

Investors often act on emotions. The main reason for the 4.2% surge in
consumer prices in April, which exited [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s, was the 10% increase
in used car prices, the fastest since the 1950s. Will the Fed cool down
a single sector by raising rates and put pressure on the rest of the
economy? The US economy, according to the jobs report, hasn’t yet
recovered. The Treasury yield surge and the [S&P 500][2] drop looked too
emotional. Now, it is time for revising the investment ideas.

I believe the current Fed’s strategy is correct. The central bank tries
to project realistic confidence in the inflation outlook combined with a
willingness to take action if anything changes. The FOMC officials say
the US economy is getting overheated, but the central bank needs several
more months of data on employment and inflation before deciding when to
end the easy money [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). As a result, The median of the US. consumers
surveyed by the University of Michigan in April expect inflation of 3.4%
over the next year, then dropping to 2.7% in the next five to 10 years.

The same thing happens with market inflation expectations, the longer
the term, the lower they are.

What level of the personal consumption expenditures price index will
force the Fed to take action? The median gauge of Reuters experts
suggests the US [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers will feel discomfort when the core PCE hits
a high of 2.8%. 36 out of 41 experts believe that the indicator should
be at this level for at least three months before the central bank
begins to act. In March, the threshold was 1.8%.

Thus, the surge in Treasury yields in response to the CPI acceleration
to 4.2% in April was another test of the Fed's strength, but gradually
the market realizes that the Fed will hardly taper the monetary stimulus
soon. I wonder why the 10-year Treasury yield is close to March highs
but the [EURUSD][1] is trading at 1.21 up from 1.17 in March. The answer
is simple, the euro-area economy is much stronger now than a couple of
months ago.

Most 10-year government bond yields in the euro area increased, only
Germany’s 10-year Bund yield remained below zero. BofA Merrill Lynch
argues that the major reason for the euro-area bond yields rise is the
US economic rebound. However, the increase in the vaccination rates
suggests the euro-area economy is about to rebound. The European
Commission lifts the euro-area GDP forecasts for 2021 from 3.8% to 4.3%.
The euro should continue the rally amid Germany’s elections. The Greens,
leading in the polls, could further push both country and continent
toward the U.S. model of aggressive government stimulus, contributing to
the integration of the euro area.

### Weekly [EURUSD][1] trading plan

Therefore, the current market swings will hardly force the Fed to change
its [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), which, coupled with the positive signals from Europe, should
suggest the [EURUSD][1] uptrend recovery. If the euro breaks out the
resistance at $1.211, it will be relevant to enter longs.
