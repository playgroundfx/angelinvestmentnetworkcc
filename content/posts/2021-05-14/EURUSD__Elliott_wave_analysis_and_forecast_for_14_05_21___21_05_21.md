EURUSD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 14.05.21 – 21.05.21Alex
Geuta

 **Main scenario:** short positions will be relevant below the level of
1.2342 with a target of 1.1600 – 1.1489.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
1.2342 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 1.2500 –
1.2600.

 **Analysis:** presumably, the first wave of larger degree 1 of (3)
formed on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame, and a downside correction is forming as
wave 2 of (3). Apparently, wave a of 2 and an ascending wave b of 2
formed on the H4 time frame. A descending wave c of 2 appears to start
developing on the H1 time frame. If the presumption is correct, the pair
will continue falling to the levels of 1.1600 – 1.1489. The level of
1.2342 is critical in this scenario. Its breakout will allow the pair to
continue rising to the levels of 1.2500 – 1.2600.
