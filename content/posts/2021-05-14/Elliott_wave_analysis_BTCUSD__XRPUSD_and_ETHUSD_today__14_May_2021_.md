Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 14.05.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

The BTCUSD price could go down lower than earlier expected; next, there
should be a correction up.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

The BTCUSD continues following in the down wave. There should be forming
a large impulse wave, with the first two sub-waves completed inside.
There is unfolding the third wave. The market may have completed two
small sub-waves (1) and (2), and wave (3) should end soon. The price
should break through the previous low and reach level 44600.00. An
approximate trajectory of the Bitcoin future price movement is outlined
in the chart.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Sell 50068.00, TP 44600.00

* * *

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

The XRPUSD pair is forming the impulse pattern. There could be unfolding
sub-wave (1) that starts a larger impulse. Sub-waves 1-2-3-4 have
completed in wave (1). Correction 4 is a triple zigzag. Over the next
few days, the Ripple price should be rising in sub-wave 5, which should
end at a level of 1.961. One could enter purchases in the current
situation.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] today:

Buy 1.361, TP 1.961

* * *

## Elliott wave Ethereum analysis

The ETHUSD price continues declining. The market must have completed the
global simple zigzag A-B-C. The chart displays the ending section of the
bullish impulse wave C. There is developing the initial part of the new
bear trend. The market should soon hit the level of the previous low,
3352.00. Next, the price should go lower. One could enter sell trades in
the current situation.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Sell 3780.07, TP 3352.00
