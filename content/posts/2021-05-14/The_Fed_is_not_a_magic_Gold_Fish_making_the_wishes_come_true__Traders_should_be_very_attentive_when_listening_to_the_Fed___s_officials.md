Dollar leads the bulls to a slaughterDmitri Demidenko

The Fed is not a magic Gold Fish making the wishes come true. Traders
should be very attentive when listening to the Fed’s officials.

## Without the growth in Treasury yield, the greenback won’t strengthen

Forecasting is an ungrateful thing; it could be dangerous at the time of
the pandemic. Economic patterns do not accurately forecast pivot points,
but they determine the trends well. The COVID-19 pandemic and its
economic fallout imply a number of pivot points. That is why the
discrepancies between the forecasts and actual data on US unemployment
and inflation for April have been so great. Bloomberg experts have been
wrong, and the markets have been jumping up and down. I am jumping with
a parachute today and tell you about the experience tomorrow. The status
was updated 84 days ago.

Unfortunately, experience teaches only to make new mistakes. A surge in
Treasury yields and the consumer prices increase to 4.2% made [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s
buy dollars. Markets remembered about March events when the greenback
strengthened amid the talks that the Treasury bull market had turned
down (the price is moving opposite the yields). The bets on the trend
reversal have ended up in losses over the decades. Will this time the
Treasury bulls go the slaughter?

Friendship with the brains serves the good. Following the Treasury yield
stabilization in April – early May, many analysts suggested that the
yields do not grow because the Fed is unwilling to normalize the
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). The real reason is that there are a lot of buyers in
the US bond market. The US Treasury yield is still much higher than that
of the government bonds in Japan or Germany. The Federal Reserve doesn’t
want to raise the interest rates, contributing to a faster shift from
euros to dollars. After all, Jerome Powell and his fellow central
bankers have poured so much money into the financial system that
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s do not know what to do with it. The Treasury bulls seem
unlikely to go to the slaughter, and traders should closely watch the
bond markets in other countries. Otherwise, they can lose their heads.
Or money. Anyway, you can’t lose more than you have.

How repulsive insincere people are! They pretend to believe when you
tell a lie! The Fed used to pledge not to correct the federal funds rate
and changed it, so it could be lying this time. The Fed is willing to be
patient, but any patience has its limits. Reuters experts say the core
PCE at 2.8% should be the limit. All [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s try to catch any word
from the Fed’s officials, but the US central bank is not a magic
goldfish fulfilling the wishes. I do not think the tests for the Fed’s
strength will result in meeting the market expectations.

If you won, somebody must have lost. That is the Forex law. Today you
enjoy your profit, and tomorrow, you are sad because of a loss. News is
not what you should rely on when making your trading decision. Good [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/)
and expectations may not do any good.
