Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 17.12.2020Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I suggest entry signals
to trade each cryptocurrency.

The three cryptocurrency pairs are forming bullish impulses. The prices
should be rising.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

The BTCUSD market is forming the final leg of the bullish impulse. The
corrective wave [4] must have completed as a double three. Next, there
has started forming the beginning of the final impulse wave [5] as an
impulse. There is now forming sub-wave (3) that should be running up to
22900.00. Next, after a decline in a short correction (4), the market
will continue rising in wave (5), as it is outlined in the chart.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 21817.00 TP 22900.00

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

The XRPUSD is forming the final leg of the bullish impulse in the most
recent chart section. The corrective wave [4] should have completed as a
zigzag (a)-(b)-(c). Therefore, the cryptocurrency pair should be rising
in wave [5]. The first upside target is at 0.603, marked by wave 4 of
the ending diagonal (c). In the current situation, one could enter long
trades.

### Trading plan for **[XRPUSD][2]** today:

Buy 0.556, TP 0.603

## Elliott wave Ethereum analysis

The horizontal corrective wave [4] must have finished within the bullish
impulse C. Wave [4] is a contracting horizontal triangle
(a)-(b)-(c)-(d)-(e). The price is now rising at the beginning of the
upward impulse wave [5]. There have completed sub-waves (1) and (2), and
there is now forming impulse (3). Next, the price should go down a
little in the corrective wave (4) and resume rising in the final wave
(5), as it is outlined in the chart.

### Trading plan for  **[ETHUSD][3] **today:

Buy 639.03, TP 680.90
