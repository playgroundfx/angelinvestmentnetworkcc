EUR/USD forecast: Dollar is driftingDmitri Demidenko

## Fundamental US dollar forecast for today

### Investors are staying aside ahead of Jerome Powell’s speech and the
publications of the US important domestic data

People see what they want to see. The euro fans are so enthusiastic that
they prefer to ignore the flaws of the single European currency. Is the
US-China trade resumed? It is not a problem! In 2018-2019, the
[EUR/USD][1] pair was falling amid the trade conflict escalation. In
2020, however, it will be rising in this case because of the
diversification of the PBOC FX reserves in favor of the euro. Are there
talks about the expansion of European QE? It is not a problem! The ECB
just can’t ease its monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) as much as the Fed. Is there the
second pandemic wave in Europe? It doesn’t matter; the illness is
asymptomatic; there won’t be another lockdown.

Optimism grows stronger. However, people with accompanying pathologies
most often die from COVID-19. If we transfer this metaphor to the global
economic sense, the accompanying pathology of the export-led euro-area
economy is a downturn of the international trade. The process started
because of trade wars, and the pandemic intensified it. According to the
CPB Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis, flows of goods
across borders were 12.5% lower in the second quarter than in the first
quarter of the year. It is the worst drop since records started in 2000.
In the three months through June, the US exports contracted by 24.8%,
the euro-area exports were 19.2% down. However, the US exports account
for 20% of the country’s GDP; in the Eurozone, they exceed 40%. The
euro-area exporters will have a difficult time, taking into account the
euro’s rapid growth.

With this regard, the USA is in a better position, which allows the
White House to repeat its mantra about the V-shaped economic recovery.
People see what they want to see.  Larry Kudlow, the chief economic
[advisor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/expert-advisor/) to Trump, ignores the problems of the US labor market and the
drop in consumer confidence to the lowest level since 2014. He stresses
the best new home sales over the past 14 years, industrial recovery, and
the [S&P500][2] record highs.

Unlike the White House, the Federal Reserve is more cautious. Jerome
Powell has many times stressed the slow GDP recovery, the necessity to
take control over OCVID-19, and fresh fiscal stimulus. The Republicans
and Democrats can’t reach an agreement for a new financial aid package,
and the Fed has to take the responsibility. So, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s anticipate
Powell’s speech in Jackson Hole to get something meaningful.

According to MUFG Bank, Powell will focus on holding low interest rates,
thereby weakening the greenback. Investors expect the Fed Chair to
express the Fed’s willingness to “seek a moderate inflation overshoot”
and reinforce its commitment to full employment. If so, there will be
other evidence that the Fed is running out of monetary tools. If the
number of Americans seeking unemployment benefits falls while durable
goods orders rise, the [EUR/USD][1] bears can go ahead and try to break
out the support levels of 1.178 and 1.1755. Otherwise, weak data and the
Fed’s willingness to weaken the dollar can resume the greenback’s
downtrend.
