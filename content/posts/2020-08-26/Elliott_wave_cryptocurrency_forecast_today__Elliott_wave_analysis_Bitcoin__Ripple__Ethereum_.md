started in early August. Correction (4) is unfolding as a triple three
W-X-Y-X-Z. There is developing the final wave Z as a simple zigzag
[a]-[b]-[c], with the [a] impulse and the [b] correction completed
inside. The price should soon be declining in the final bearish impulse
[c] towards a level of 10900.00.

higher degree. The market is likely to continue declining in the impulse
wave (C) towards a level of 314.00. At this level, the down corrective
