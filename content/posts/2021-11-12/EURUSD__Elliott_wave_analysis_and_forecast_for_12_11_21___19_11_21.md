EURUSD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 12.11.21 – 19.11.21Alex
Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 1.1610 with a target of 1.1390 – 1.1287.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
1.1610 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 1.1690 –
1.1910.

 **Analysis:** Daily chart: the first wave of larger degree 1 of (3) is
formed, and a downside correction continues forming as wave 2 of (3),
with wave c of 2 unfolding as part of it. On the H4 chart, the third
wave of smaller degree (iii) of c appears to have formed , a local
correction finished developing in the form of wave (iv) of с, and the
fifth wave (v) of c is forming at the moment. Wave iii of (v) is
developing on the H1 chart. If this assumption is correct, the pair will
continue to fall to 1.1390 – 1.1287. The level of 1.1610 is critical in
this scenario. Its breakout will allow the pair to continue rising to
the levels of 1.1690 – 1.1910.
