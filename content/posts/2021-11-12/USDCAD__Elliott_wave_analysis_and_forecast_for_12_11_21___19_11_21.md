USDCAD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 12.11.21 – 19.11.21Alex
Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions from corrections above the
level of 1.2382 with a target of 1.2773 – 1.2892.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
1.2382 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of 1.2285
– 1.2150.

 **Analysis:** a descending correction appears to have formed as the
fourth wave 4 of larger degree on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) chart, with wave (С) of 4
completed and an ascending wave 5 unfolding inside. H4 chart: wave 1 of
(1) of 5 is formed, and a downward correction is completed as wave 2 of
(1) of 5. Apparently, the third wave 3 of (1) has started developing on
the H1 chart, with the first counter-trend wave of smaller degree i of 3
still forming inside. If the presumption is correct, the pair will
continue to rise to the levels of 1.2773 – 1.2892. The level of 1.2382
is critical in this scenario as its breakout will enable the pair to
continue declining to the levels of 1.2285 – 1.2150.
