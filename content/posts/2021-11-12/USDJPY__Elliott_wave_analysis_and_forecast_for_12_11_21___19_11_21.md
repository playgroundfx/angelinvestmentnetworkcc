USDJPY: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 12.11.21 – 19.11.21Alex
Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions from corrections above the
level of 112.75 with a target of 116.00 – 118.00.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
112.75 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of 110.83
– 109.12.

 **Analysis:** Daily chart: there's an ascending wave of larger degree C
that presumably has started forming. The third wave 3 of (1) of С is
unfolding as part of the wave C. H4 chart: a correction is completed as
wave ii of 3, and wave iii of 3 is forming. On the H1 chart, apparently,
there's wave (iii) of iii formed, a local correction completed as wave
(iv) of iii, and wave (v) of iii forming. If the presumption is correct,
the pair will continue to rise to the levels of 116.00 – 118.00. The
level of 112.75 is critical in this scenario as its breakout will enable
the pair to continue declining to the levels of 110.83 – 109.12.
