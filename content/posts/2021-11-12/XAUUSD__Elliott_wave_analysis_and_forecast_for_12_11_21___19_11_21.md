XAUUSD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 12.11.21 – 19.11.21Alex
Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions from corrections above the
level of 1758.95 with a target of 1960.00 – 2075.27.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
1758.95 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of
1720.60 – 1673.63.

 **Analysis:** Daily chart: an ascending third wave of larger degree (3)
is formed, a descending correction developed as the fourth wave (4), and
the fifth wave (5) appears to be unfolding, with the first wave of
smaller degree 1of (5) formed inside. H4 chart: apparently, a corrective
wave 2 of (5) is completed, and wave 3 of (5) has started unfolding.
Wave i of 3 is formed, and a correction is completed in the form of wave
ii of 3 as parts of wave 3 of (5). The third wave iii of 3 is developing
on the H1 chart, with wave (ii) of iii completed and wave (iii) of iii
forming inside. If the presumption is correct, the pair will continue to
rise to the levels of 1960.00 – 2075.27. The level of 1758.95 is
critical in this scenario as its breakout will enable the pair to
continue declining to the levels of 1720.60 – 1673.63.
