GBPUSD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 12.11.21 – 19.11.21Alex
Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 1.3610 with a target of 1.3157 – 1.2831.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
1.3610 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 1.3832 –
1.4050.

 **Analysis:** Daily chart: the first wave of larger degree (1) has
formed and a downside correction continues forming as wave (2). H4
chart: waves A of (2) and B of (2) are formed, and wave C of (2) is
developing. Apparently, the first wave of smaller degree i of C and a
corrective wave ii of C are formed on the H1chart. Wave iii of C is
currently developing. If this assumption is correct, the pair will
continue to fall to the levels of 1.3157 – 1.2831. The level of 1.3610
is critical in this scenario as a breakout will enable the pair to
continue rising to the levels of 1.3832 – 1.4050.
