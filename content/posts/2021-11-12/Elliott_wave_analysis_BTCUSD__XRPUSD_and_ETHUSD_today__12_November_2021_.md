Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 12.11.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

All three cryptocurrency pairs covered in the article should be rising
in bullish impulse sub-waves of a smaller degree.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

The BTCUSD market is forming the impulse upwave (A), with sub-waves
1-2-3-4 completed inside. The fifth sub-wave is currently unfolding.
Corrective wave 4 of a smaller degree has recently completed as a double
three [W]-[X]-[Y] within the upward impulse (5) of [5]. The Bitcoin
price should rise in sub-wave [5] of a smaller degree to a level of
73100.00, where wave 5 will be 50% of wave 3.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 64967.50, TP 73100.00

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

The XRPUSD continues forming linking wave (X), with the final sub-wave
unfolding inside as a double zigzag [W]-[X]-[Y]. The [X] is a flat
(A)-(B)-(C). There is now unfolding the upward wave [Y] as a double
zigzag (W)-(X)-(Y). Impulse wave A, the first sub-wave of the zigzag-
shaped wave (Y), has completed. The bearish correction B has also
finished. The Ripple price should be rising in the C impulse to a level
of 1.380, as outlined in the chart.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] **** today:

Buy 1.211, TP 1.380

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

The hourly ETHUSD chart displays the upward impulse wave [5] composed of
sub-waves (1)-(2)-(3)-(4)-(5). The first four parts of this pattern,
sub-waves (1)-(2)-(3)-(4), have finished, and the upward wave (5) is
forming. The price must have been corrected down in sub-wave 4 recently,
so it will be rising in wave 5 to a level of 4930.00.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Buy 4785.92, TP 4930.00
