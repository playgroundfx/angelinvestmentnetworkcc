Dollar bets on rates. Forecast as of 12.11.2021Dmitri Demidenko

The divergence in monetary policies is the most powerful Forex driver.
Trade wars, pandemics, and elections come and go, but the monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) continues to affect the foreign exchange rates. How do central
banks’ interest rates affect the [EURUSD][1]? Let us discuss the Forex
outlook and make up a trading plan.

## Quarterly US dollar fundamental forecast

In the middle of the year, when [EURUSD][1] was trading above 1.18, I
stated that the price was more likely to go down to 1.14 than to return
to 1.22, and many would oppose. At that time, the euro uptrend against
the US dollar, and the price drop looked like just a correction. I was
convinced that the bet on the divergence in the monetary policies of the
Fed and the European Central Bank should work. And it has worked!

It is hard to expect the ECB to sound hawkish when the euro-area economy
has been about to slide into deflation for most of the last decade. From
2014 to 2019, consumer prices grew by an average of 0.9%, and if we
consider the current surge above 4% as a temporary phenomenon, Christine
Lagarde and her colleagues clearly should not rush to raise rates.
Especially in 2022, as the money markets expect. Furthermore, the
European Commission forecasts the euro-area CPI will slow down to 1.4%
in 2023. If it turns out to be wrong, monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) could be tightened
later that year. In the meantime, the ECB should replace the emergency
purchase programme, which expires in March, with its regular
quantitative easing programme, APP.

Yes, the ECB may raise the deposit rate by the end of 2023, but the Fed
could raise the federal funds rate six times by that time. If so, there
must be a huge gap between the US and German bond yields, which for
years has been an indicator helping analysts predict the [EURUSD][1]
trend. For example, Nordea Markets expect to see the euro-dollar at
1.085 at the end of 2022. Based on the risk reversals, the forecast
doesn’t seem unreal.

The derivatives market has already made up its own schedule for the
Fed’s rate changes. It is expected that the federal funds rate will be
hiked in July, September, and December. The likelihood of the third rate
hike in 2022 is still fifty-fifty, but it may increase if inflation
continues to accelerate. Based on changes in wages, rents, and other
indicators, US inflation will continue rising! If so, there could be
another three rate hikes in 2023.

The Federal Reserve still repeats its mantra about the temporary nature
of high inflation, although it has begun to admit that this period will
be longer than previously thought. It is suggested consumer price growth
should slow down by mid-2022. But the US inflation will still be above
the 2% target. The return of the US economy to full employment will
force the central bank to tighten its monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).

### Quarterly [EURUSD][1] trading plan

Therefore, the [EURUSD][1] downtrend is strong and stable. Any price
rises should be interpreted as corrections. The euro will hardly become
more appealing to [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s than the dollar. It is still relevant to
sell the [EURUSD][1] on the corrections. The downside targets are at
1.133 and 1.122.
