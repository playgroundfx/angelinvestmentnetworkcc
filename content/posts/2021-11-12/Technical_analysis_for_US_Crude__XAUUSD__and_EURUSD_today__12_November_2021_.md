Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 12.11.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

Yesterday, a short-term euro downtrend continued.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

A short-term oil downtrend continues. The target of the trend is the
lower Target Zone 78.48 - 77.97. The correction occurred yesterday. As
part of the correction, the price tested the mirror resistance level
81.03 - 80.77. This level was held by sellers. As a result, the price
declined at the close of the US trading session.

Today oil is trading below the Additional Zone 80.54 - 80.41. I
recommend looking for sales according to the pattern with the first
target at yesterday's low.

To enter oil purchases, traders need to break out the trend key
resistance 81.94 - 81.68.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

  1. Sell according to the pattern in Additional Zone 80.54 - 80.41. TakeProfit: 79.20, Target Zone 78.48 - 77.97. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. Sell according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 81.94 - 81.68. TakeProfit: 79.20, Target Zone 78.48 - 77.97. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

Traders have broken out the Gold Zone 2 1854 - 1852. The next target for
purchases within the short-term uptrend is the Target Zone 3 1875 -
1871.

Yesterday, traders tested the trend key support 1849 - 1847. The price
is rising in this support zone. The first growth target is the update of
the November 10 high. The second target is Target Zone 3.

The breakout of level 1847, which serves as the trend key support, and
price consolidation below are required for gold sales. In this case, the
target for sales will be the lower Target Zone 1831 - 1827.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

Buy in the zone of 1854 - 1847. TakeProfit: Target Zone 3 1875 - 1871.
StopLoss: 1843.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

Yesterday, a short-term euro downtrend continued. The price came as
close as possible to the Gold Zone 1.1428 - 1.1419. Today expect the
price to continue to fall and to reach the target.

Stay out of the market today and wait for a correction to sell the euro
at the best possible price. Favorable sell prices will be in the
Additional Zone 1.1484 - 1.1480 and the zone of the trend key resistance
1.1532 - 1.1524.

The breakout of the trend key resistance and price consolidation higher
at the US trading session are required for euro purchases.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

  1. Sell according to the pattern in Additional Zone 1.1484 - 1.1480. TakeProfit: Gold Zone 1.1428 - 1.1419. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. Sell according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 1.1532 - 1.1524. TakeProfit: Gold Zone 1.1428 - 1.1419. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.
