USDCHF: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 12.11.21 – 19.11.21Alex
Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions from corrections above the
level of 0.9098 with a target of 0.9368 – 0.9506.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
0.9098 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of 0.9016
– 0.8924.

 **Analysis:** a descending first wave of larger degree (1) of 5 is
presumably formed on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) chart. A correction continues developing
as the second wave (2) of 5, with waves A of (2) and В of (2) formed and
wave С of (2) forming inside. The third wave of smaller degree iii of C
has formed, and a local correction developed as the fourth wave iv of C
on the H4 chart. The fifth wave v of C appears to start forming on the
H1 chart. If the presumption is correct, the pair will continue to rise
to the levels of 0.9368 – 0.9506. The level of 0.9098 is critical in
this scenario. Its breakout will allow the pair to continue falling to
the levels of 0.9016 – 0.8924.
