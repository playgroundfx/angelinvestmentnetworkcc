USDCAD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 16.07.2021 –
23.07.2021Alex Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider short positions below the level of 1.2880
with a target of 1.2000 – 1.1850 once correction is completed.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
1.2880 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 1.3413 –
1.3722.

 **Analysis:** Wave (С) of 4 of larger degree continues developing on
the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame, with the third wave 3 of (C) formed inside.
Presumably, an ascending correction is nearing completion as wave 4 of
(С) on the H4 time frame, with wave c of 4 forming inside. Apparently,
wave (v) of c is nearing completion on the H1 time frame. If this
assumption is correct, the pair will continue to fall to 1.2000 – 1.1850
once wave c of 4 is completed. The level of 1.2880 is critical in this
scenario as a breakout will enable the pair to continue rising to the
levels of 1.3413 – 1.3722.
