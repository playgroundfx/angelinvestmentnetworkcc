Dollar has doubts. Forecast as of 16.07.2021Dmitri Demidenko

No currency can’t grow in price indefinitely. The forecasts for
[EURUSD][1] at 1.25 were based on the Fed's passive attitude. The change
to a more aggressive tone turned the trend down. Let us discuss the
Forex outlook and make up a trading plan.

## Quarterly US dollar fundamental forecast

If you are uncertain, buy the US dollar. This principle works well for a
safe-haven asset like a greenback, but in July, the USD does not rise
because [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are averse to risk. Markets are focused on changes in
the Fed's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). Jerome Powell's uncertainty about the
temporary nature of the inflation surge is interpreted as another step
towards [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) tightening and a stronger dollar. If you are uncertain,
buy the dollar. If you feel that the Fed’s president is uncertain, buy
the dollar actively.

According to Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, the Fed has
identified a “half dozen things” that “look very much like temporary
factors” that will disappear over time. The central bankers don’t know
whether there are other things coming along to replace the temporary
factors. In any case, the Federal Reserve is closely monitoring whether
its forecast of the temporary nature of an excessively high inflation
period is correct or whether it threatens to turn out to be long-term.
Thus, Powell no longer has his former confidence, and he has doubts. And
there are reasons!

The shock associated with the opening of the economy triggered a surge
in inflation well above 2%, and, of course, the Fed is not happy with
that. Further acceleration of CPI and PCE and/or weak employment
recovery, accompanied by higher wages, could force the central bank to
tighten monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) sooner than it currently expects.

According to 39 out of 41 Reuters experts, the Fed will taper its $120
billion a month asset purchase program by the end of 2022; three of them
believe that this will happen before the end of 2021. The consensus
forecast assumes that the federal funds rate will be raised in 2023;
however, the number of respondents expecting this to happen next year
has increased significantly. 30 out of 50 economists believe that the
biggest risk to the US economy is the spread of new strains of COVID-19;
13 are scared by high inflation; 5 - by the early tightening of the
Fed's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).

### Reuters Polls

Thus, the end of QE is expected in 2022, the federal funds rate hike –
in 2023. However, the long period of inflation above the target and the
persistence of bottlenecks in the labor market, contributing to the
acceleration of wages, may shift these forecasts to an earlier period,
which will support the US dollar. Yes, the FOMC doves insist that the
progress that the Fed wants to see in employment has not yet been made,
but not all central bankers share this opinion. Federal Reserve Bank of
St. Louis President James Bullard says the time is right to pull back
emergency measures.  “We do want to do it gently and carefully, but I
think we’re in a very good position to start a taper,” he said. As a
result, the [EURUSD][2] dropped to the bottom of figure 18.

### Quarterly [EURUSD][2] trading plan

In the first half of 2021, I wrote about the euro uptrend, expecting it
to rise to $1.25. However, after the Fed had changed its tone in June, I
wrote about the trend reversal down. I also recommended selling the
EURUSD at a level above 1.19 with a target at 1.177, which has been
reached. It is still relevant to sell; the next downside targets are at
levels 1.1715, 1.1665, and 1.1585.
