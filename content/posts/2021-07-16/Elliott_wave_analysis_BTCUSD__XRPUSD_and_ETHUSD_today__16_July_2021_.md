Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 16.07.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

The XRPUSD market continues developing the descending linking wave as a
triple combination. The final leg of the combination should be
developing soon.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

The BTCUSD market is forming a bearish zigzag, with the first impulse
wave [A] completed inside. There is currently unfolding a bullish
correction as a double zigzag (W)-(X)-(Y). The linking wave (X) may have
completed as a triple zigzag, so the Bitcoin price should be rising in
the final motive wave (Y) to a level above 36640.00. One could enter buy
trades in the current situation.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 31933.00, TP 36640.00

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

The XRPUSD has been rising in the zigzag-shaped wave. There could be
forming a double zigzag W-X-Y. The first motive wave W could have
completed, and there should be unfolding the bearish linking wave X,
which looks like a triple zigzag and is about to end soon. There is
unfolding the final leg of this zigzag, sub-wave [Z]. Sub-wave [Z] is a
double zigzag, which will be concluded by wave (Y). The price should be
declining in the (Y) wave to a level of 0.560, where wave X will be
76.4% of the W wave.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] **** today:

Sell 0.608, TP 0.560

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

The ETHUSD, like the BTCUSD, is forming a descending zigzag, with the
first wave, impulse A, completed inside. There is forming the B wave as
a simple zigzag [A]-[B]-[C]. The sub-waves [A] and [B], impulse and
zigzag, must have completed. Therefore, the upward wave [C] should be
unfolding as an impulse. The Ethereum price will be rising to a level
well above the high of 2407.00.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Buy 1945.75, TP 2407.00
