GBPUSD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 16.07.2021 –
23.07.2021Alex Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 1.3908 with a target of 1.3660 – 1.3572.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
1.3908 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 1.4017 –
1.4253.

 **Analysis:** Presumably, the first wave of larger degree (1) finished
developing on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame, with wave 5 of (1) formed inside. A
descending correction started developing as wave (2) on the H4 time
frame, with waves A of (2) and B of (2) formed inside. Apparently, a
descending wave С of (2) continues developing on the H1 time frame, with
a corrective wave of smaller degree iv of C completed and wave v of C
developing inside. If this assumption is correct, the pair will continue
to fall to 1.3660 – 1.3572. The level of 1.3908 is critical in this
scenario as a breakout will enable the pair to continue rising to the
levels of 1.4017 – 1.4253.
