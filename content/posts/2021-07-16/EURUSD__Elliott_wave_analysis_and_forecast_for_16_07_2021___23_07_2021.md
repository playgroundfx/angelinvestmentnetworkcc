EURUSD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 16.07.2021 –
23.07.2021Alex Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 1.1974 with a target of 1.1600 – 1.1489.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
1.1974 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 1.2269 –
1.2500.

 **Analysis:** Presumably, the first wave of larger degree 1 of (3)
formed and a downside correction is forming as wave 2 of (3) on the
[daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame. Apparently, wave a of 2 and an ascending wave b of 2
formed on the H4 time frame. A descending wave c of 2 is developing on
the H1 time frame, with the third wave of smaller degree (iii) of c
completed and a local correction nearing completion as wave (iv) of c
inside. If the presumption is correct, the pair will continue to fall to
the levels of 1.1600 – 1.1489 after correction. The level of 1.1974 is
critical in this scenario. Its breakout will allow the pair to continue
rising to the levels of 1.2269 – 1.2500.
