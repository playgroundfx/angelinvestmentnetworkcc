The Federal Reserve does not change its old opinion, although the
conditions have changed significantly

## When will Jerome Powell get nervous?

Nothing elevates a person above the crowd like the gallows.
Congressional Democrats and Republicans were willing to hang Jerome
Powell for allowing core inflation to hit its highest levels since the
1990s. They say they are nervous and are looking forward to when the Fed
chairman starts to get nervous. They intend to sleep with one eye open
until the central bank does what its predecessors did - tightens
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). There were a lot of tips, but usually when a person
distributes a lot of recommendations, they tend to lose its relevance.

Some people, after they left their mark in [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/), should have put
things in order afterwards. Jerome Powell and his team are terrified of
Ben Bernanke's heritage who launched a taper tantrum in 2013 after the
announcement of the QE tapering. So the Fed decided to signal the QE
reduction very carefully. This event had a negative effect. The debt
market claims that monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) will be tightened sooner than FOMC
officials say. The yield on monetary-sensitive 2-year Treasuries is
rising, while the yield on 10-year bonds is falling. This is usually
interpreted as a potential slowdown in the economy due to the upcoming
increase in the federal funds rate.

You'd better throw a grenade in such a way, so that it can kill someone
else besides you. With its wait-and-see approach, the Fed risks
provoking another recession. Further acceleration of inflation will
force it to raise federal funds rates very aggressively. This risks
ruining the economy. It looks like the debt market is right: tightening
of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) is a necessity. The Fed is having problems with how
to make it softer so as not to provoke panic in the market.

Donald Trump played the role of the executioner during his presidency.
He regularly accused Jerome Powell calling him an enemy of the United
States. Now the vacancy is free, so the Fed chairman is forced to come
up with a solution that will save him from a headache. That's the way
life is, the heads of central banks, as well as everyone else, have
problems.

Why shouldn't the Fed admit that the conditions during which it stuck to
a wait-and-see approach have changed? There is no 2020 anymore. The US
economy is recovering at a much faster pace than expected. Fiscal [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
has provided significantly more incentives, and inflation accelerated
much faster than one might have expected. Conditions, in other words,
the weather, have changed significantly, but the Fed still prefers to go
out in the same clothes, believing that there is no bad weather. Only
terrible cold and unbearable heat.
