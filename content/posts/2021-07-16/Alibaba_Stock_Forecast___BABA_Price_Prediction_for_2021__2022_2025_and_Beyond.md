Alibaba Stock Forecast: 2021 and BeyondJana Kane

Alibaba is often referred to as the "Amazon of China". [Alibaba][1] has
more products than just the web store. In 2019, Alibaba Group Holding
Ltd grew into one of China's largest groups of companies, with
significant global influence. It first gained control of the Chinese
e-commerce market. In 2019, its “Tmall” was among the leading three
Chinese e-commerce retailers, including JD.com and Pinduoduo, with a
[reported 80%][2] of online retail sales in China running through the
company.

Alibaba offers a range of products for brands looking to compete in the
e-commerce market. The company's main business segments include mobile
media and entertainment, cloud computing, core commerce, and other
initiatives. The E-commerce giant is currently not included in the U.S.
stock market index, S&P 500 stock index, or the Nasdaq 100 stock index.
Are you interested in investing and trading Alibaba stocks? In this
article, we discuss the direction the Alibaba forecast could go and make
a price prediction for many years to come.

The article covers the following subjects:

## About Alibaba

Ma Yun, better known as Jack Ma, launched Alibaba.com (the first product) in 1999. The company entered the stock exchange in September 2014. As was mentioned in the introduction, neither S&P 500 nor Nasdaq 100 are an Alibaba stock index. The company is, however, listed on other respectable indices. One Alibaba index is [ARCA Institutional][3] (USA). A second Alibaba index is [CSI Overseas Mainland Enterprises][4] (Hong Kong). A third Alibaba index we should note is [NYSE Composite][5] (USA).

The Alibaba Group mainly includes:

  * Alibaba.com (including 1688.com and AliExpress.com): mainly business to business e-commerce
  * Taobao.com: similar to Amazon/eBay: business to consumer or consumer to consumer
  * Tmall.com: A platform for local Chinese and international businesses to sell brand name goods to consumers in Greater China; large multinational brands (e.g., Apple, Nike) for the Chinese middle class.

The company is the most significant e-commerce player in China (with
more than 50% market share). Like Amazon, it is also involved in many
other things such as IT infrastructure, cloud computing, and media and
entertainment (including films and "YouTube variant" Youku). It invests
in a whole range of listed and unlisted companies. Every quarter, gains
or losses are booked on investments in listed companies (Alibaba
invests, among others, Bilibili (sort of like YouTube), Lyft (Uber
competitor), and Weibo (social network)), which makes the results more
volatile.

The Chinese government [recently fined][6] Alibaba marketplace for
monopolistic practices for 18.2 billion yuan ($2.8 billion), accounting
for 4% of sales in China in 2019.  Alibaba prevented customers from
offering their goods on competing platforms. The company will now take
steps to ensure fair competition.

## Factors That May Impact Alibaba

Various factors may affect BABA stocks. Below are four fundamental
factors that any BABA trader or [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) should analyze.

### 1\. International Markets

The first challenge to Alibaba's future, of course, is its ability to
develop in markets other than China. The group has already achieved a
good reputation in its country of origin, but it also has all the
necessary assets for conquering the world market.

Alibaba already has a strong presence in Southeast Asia through the
e-commerce platform Lazada. And over the last several years, the company
has been making steps forward - a distribution center in Belgium, an
AliExpress store in Spain, and a campaign with 100,000 content creators
to promote its services to the European market. Some of the potentially
profitable markets include Latin America and Africa.

But differences in [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) and perception toward data make it harder to
expand globally, especially in Western Europe and the USA.

### 2\. Competitors

Of course, Alibaba also has to face specific threats, including the
significant development potential of some competitors. Besides, the
Indian market, which is considered a priority by Alibaba, already has
two substantial competitors with a solid reputation with Amazon and
Flipkart. In reality, it will take Alibaba time to learn about these two
companies that have been operating in the country for some time.
Globally, Alibaba has been facing increasingly fierce competition in
recent years, with several large groups such as eBay, Amazon, JD, and
Tencent posing severe threats.

### 3\. Government Regulations

As we saw above, it's wise to consider the Chinese government's
[regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/)s before taking up your investing or trading position. Judging
from its previous price [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/), we can say that negative [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) can
impact Alibaba’s value, such as the monopoly scandal that resulted in a
record fine of $2.8 billion.

At the same time, in Alibaba stock projections, we can’t disregard the
fact that Alibaba already established a special task force. It consists
of leaders from its relevant business units who work together to review
compliance.

### 4\. Demand for New Services

The strong demand for new services available on other e-commerce
platforms significantly reduces profitability for Alibaba. This can
cause a loss of [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/) interest in this stock.

To address the issue, Alibaba implemented new financing and freight-
shipping services for SMEs. Boosting small-business sales is the current
trend in Alibaba’s stated goal in the USA and has been so for quite a
while. The good [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) is that Alibaba’s growth has been the most
significant in the US market in the past year.



## Alibaba Stock Price Prediction for 2021 by Experts

At the end of March 2021, Macquarie Bank analysts [reissued][7] their
outperform rating on the Alibaba stock, although they reduced their
target price to $407 per share from $421 previously. They also revised
their 2021 earnings estimates for Alibaba but noted that “the stock is
at good risk/reward.”

Online stock forecasting service Wallet Investor is bullish in its
Alibaba stock price prediction for 2021 and beyond, estimating on April
18, 2021, that the future price would climb from its mid-April mark of
$226 per share to $275.95 by December 2021, $337.11 per share by
December 2022, and $524.82 by December 2023.

 Based on analyst recommendations offering 12-month BABA stock price
targets in the last three months, the average stock price target is
$311.85 with a maximum value of $338 and a minimum estimate of $260.

In particular, in April, the stock received a “Strong Buy” rating from
Youssef Squali from Truist Securities, Aaron Kessler from Raymond James,
Hans Chung from KeyBanc, Alicia Yap from Citigroup, and Gary Yu from
Morgan Stanley.

## Alibaba Group (BABA) Stock Technical Analysis

The priority task of [BABA][8] technical analysis will be identifying
Alibaba share price's general trends and key levels. To do that, we'll
examine the biggest time frame first.

As shown in the monthly chart above, Alibaba's stock has followed a
long-term bullish trend since 2017 (marked with a blue solid line). The
BABA stock price then moved to the downside at the end of 2020, as
indicated with a blue dotted line in the chart. However, it's hard to
say for sure if that's a temporary correction or a fully-developed trend
reversal.

[Alibaba][9]'s fall may be forecast if the chart breaks through the
trend line and goes down within this year. In that case, the price
target will be the support level at 162 USD formed at one of the
previous minimums.

If the price chart pulls back, we will speak about Alibaba Group's
strong bullish potential and an uptrend may be expected to resume, the
nearest price target being 275 US dollars.

### BABA Forecast For Next Three Months

To make a realistic forecast for the next three months, let's do a
technical analysis of the weekly price chart using MACD.

MACD indications indirectly confirm an assumption that the Alibaba share
price may pull back from the trend line in the future. Note that the
histogram reached the lowest values in the past three years and is now
forming a bullish divergence. The MACD line crossed the signal line from
below. If it goes to the upside in the coming weeks, we’ll have a fully-
developed signal of a reversal.

Other indications of a resumption of a bullish trend include a fall in
trading volumes in the second phase of correction and absence of
significant signals of a global trend reversal. Thus, BABA's projected
value will most likely range from 190 to 230 US dollars in the next
three months.

### Long-Term Alibaba Group Technical Analysis for 2021

Let's analyze the price [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/) and forecast future price movements for
the rest of the year 2021.

To make a forecast for Alibaba's share price, I used [Bollinger Bands](https://www.algotradesoft.org/custom-indicator/bollinger-bands.html)'
projections. Alibaba's expected trading range for each month is
presented in the prediction chart.

A fading bearish potential will continue pushing the price down to the
trend line in summer and at the beginning of autumn. In the first place,
it's China's new economic [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) aimed at phasing out monetary help that
puts pressure on BABA shares.

Some believe that the stress test of the Chinese economy won't last
long, and the economy will start growing naturally a few months later,
setting market sentiment for years to come. So, bears won't most likely
break through support at the trend line, and the many-year bullish trend
will continue.

[Alibaba's][10] stock price will attempt to cross the level of 200 USD
but remain in the range of 190-230 USD.

#### Long-term trading plan for Alibaba

A fully-developed reversal will occur once the price breaks through the
upper limit of the trading range at 230 USD or pulls back from the main
trend line at around 190 - 200 USD. Those are conditions for opening
long positions.

I’ve marked those levels with a blue dotted line in the chart above. A
Take Profit target will be the sellers' active zone at around 275 USD
marked with a green dotted line. It's here that we can fix a part of
profits to avoid losses if the price reverses and crosses the stop line
at 170 USD. Stop Loss can be moved to 205 USD to protect a part of
profits.

Positions can be closed entirely at the latest [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) peak of 320
USD. However, bear in mind that it is a long-term target which may not
be reached before next year.

## How Did the Price of Alibaba Change Over Time?

The current price of BABA stocks on 17.07.2021 is  $212.07.

We can’t predict with certainty what the BABA stock price will be in the
next 10 years, but we can look back at the Alibaba [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) trends.
This can help us make more reliable BABA predictions. Below is a
[historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) timeline that shows how the price of the BABA stock changed
over the past 5 years. Notice how the pandemic and the “monopoly
situation” negatively affected the Alibaba stock performance at the end
of the timeline.

## What Is the Future of the Alibaba Stock Price? Is Alibaba Still a
Good Investment?

Alibaba shares are currently both a good short-term trade and
potentially a profitable investment. Keep in mind that there is pressure
on the company – the Chinese government recently called Alibaba on the
mat because of several developments at the company. The [rate of
Alibaba][1] may respond to this. Below is a BABA stock forecast chart

After Alibaba opened distribution centers worldwide, the Chinese
government thought it was time to speak with Alibaba after launching a
program against monopolies. In that context, Alibaba received an
invitation to come and talk about this. The Chinese government would
like Alibaba to apply several rules. For example, the sellers on the
platform are not allowed to offer their products to other online stores.

The Chinese government also wants more financial supervision of the
entire situation around Alibaba. It remains to be seen to what extent
the requirements of the Chinese government will adjust Alibaba's
business operations and whether it will have a significant effect on the
outlook on Alibaba shares.

Keep a close eye on the [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) about the interventions of the Chinese
government in this company. The rules imposed may have far-reaching
consequences for the company's global operations. Regulatory approval or
disapproval may have an immediate effect on the [Alibaba stock
price][1].
