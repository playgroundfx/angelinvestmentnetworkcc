USDCHF: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 16.07.2021 –
23.07.2021Alex Geuta

 **Main scenario:** Consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 0.9269 with a target of 0.9096 – 0.9055.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
0.9269 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 0.9370 –
0.9476.

 **Analysis:** Daily time frame: presumably, a descending first wave of
larger degree (1) of 5 formed, and an ascending correction is now
developing as second wave (2) of 5. On the H4 time frame, wave A of (2)
formed and wave B of (2) finished developing. Apparently, wave С of (2)
started developing on the H1 time frame, with the first wave of smaller
degree i of C formed and a downward correction developing as wave ii of
C inside. If this assumption is correct, the pair will continue to fall
to 0.9096 – 0.9055. The level of 0.9269 is critical in this scenario.
Its breakout will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of
0.9370 – 0.9476.
