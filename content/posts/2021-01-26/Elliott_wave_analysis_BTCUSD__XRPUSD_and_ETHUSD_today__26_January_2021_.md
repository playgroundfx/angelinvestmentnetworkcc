Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 26.01.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

Cryptocurrency pairs correlated with each other. All three
cryptocurrency pairs covered in the article are forming the third sub-
waves in the bullish impulses.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

The BTC market has completed the corrective wave 4 as a double zigzag
[W]-[X]-[Y]. Next, the Bitcoin price has turned up and started rising.
There is forming the initial element of the bullish impulse. The sub-
waves [1] and [2] must have completed, so the market should be running
up in the impulse wave [3] and exceed the previous high made by wave
(1). Therefore, one could consider purchases with a target at 34865.00

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 31946.00 TP 34865.00

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

The Ripple market is forming the final leg of the bullish impulse
1-2-3-4-5. There is developing wave 5, namely its final sub-wave. The
down impulse [1] has completed. And the corrective wave [2] must have
completed as a double zigzag (w)-(x)-(y). Therefore, the Ripple price
should be growing to a level of 0.330, which is the high made by the
linking wave [X]. One could enter buy trades under the current
conditions.

### Trading plan for **[XRPUSD][2]** today:

Buy 0.266, TP 0.330

## Elliott wave Ethereum analysis

As it is clear from the most recent chart section, the ETHUSD market has
finished the corrective wave 4 as a double zigzag [w]-[x]-[y]. Next, the
price has started rising. There should be developing the initial element
of the impulse wave 5. There have completed the sub-waves [1] and [2],
and there is now forming impulse [3]. The market should be running up in
wave (5) to a level above the previous high made by wave (3), that is,
above 1470.00.

### Trading plan for  **[ETHUSD][3] **today:

Buy 1327.07, TP 1470.00
