Short-term forecast for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 26.01.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

EURUSD is correcting. The short-term trend is up.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

Oil is testing the support level 51.88. If the price doesn't break out
the level, the medium-term uptrend will continue, and the target in
Target Zone 4 [54.72 - 54.21] will be reached.

If the bears break out the support of 51.88, then a medium-term
correction in the trend key support [49.39 - 48.94] zone will occur.

The short-term trend is up. Yesterday, the traders tested the resistance
of the Additional Zone [52.66 - 52.55]. It was not possible to break out
the zone. Let's see if it works out today.

Since the AZ's resistance is held, consider selling oil according to the
pattern to update last week's low.

For oil purchases, the price must be consolidated above the level of
52.66. In this case, a pattern for opening a trade with a target at the
January's high + Target Zone 3 [55.00 - 54.53] will appear.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

  1. Sell according to the pattern in Additional Zone [52.66 - 52.55]. TakeProfit: Intermediary Zone [51.66 - 51.43]. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

  2. If the price breaks out the Additional Zone [52.66 - 52.55], buy. TakeProfit: 53.90, Target Zone 3 [55.00 - 54.53]. StopLoss: below the significant local low.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

Gold is testing the broken-out accumulation zone [1859 - 1816] from top
to bottom. Look for purchases within the medium-term uptrend with the
target at Target Zone 2 [2005.8 - 1994.3].

Sell metal if the traders break out the level of 1818 and consolidate
the price below.

Let's take a look at the chart of a shorter timeframe and analyze the
short-term trend.

The gold short-term trend is up. The target for purchases is Target Zone
[1912 - 1902].

Now the price is trading above the local support of the Additional Zone
[1849 - 1847]. Look for/hold purchases with the goal outlined above.

The second area to look for long trades is key support [1825 - 1820]. If
the price corrects into this area, watch the traders' reaction.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

  1. Hold up medium-term purchases entered in the zone of [1859.2 - 1816.9]. TakeProfit: Target Zone 2 [2005.8 - 1994.3]. StopLoss: 1830.

  2. Enter short-term purchases/hold purchases in Additional Zone [1849 - 1847]. TakeProfit: 1874, Target Zone [1912 - 1902]. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

EURUSD medium-term downtrend continues. The zone of good sell prices is
[1.2229 - 1.2146]. Expect a sell pattern to be formed.

EURUSD is correcting. The short-term trend is up. The target for buying
the euro is Target Zone [1.2229 - 1.2213].

Yesterday the traders broke out the first support at Additional Zone
[1.2149 - 1.2145]. There was no buyers' reaction to this zone.

Today, the price should further decline and test the zone of good buy
prices [1.2109 - 1.2077]. Look for euro purchases according to the
pattern in this area.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:
