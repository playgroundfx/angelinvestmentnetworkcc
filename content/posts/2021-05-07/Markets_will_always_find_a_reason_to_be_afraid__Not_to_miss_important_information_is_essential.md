Forex: from divorce to wedding. Review as of 07.05.2021Dmitri Demidenko

Markets will always find a reason to be afraid. Not to miss important
information is essential.

## Threat of another divorce looms up ahead of pound while dollar gets
ready for bachelor party

The devil is in the detail. Investors were frightened of rumors about
another referendum on Scottish independence and Janet Yellen's saying
the Fed's [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) could be tightened so that the US economy wouldn't
overheat. So they completely overlooked some important factors. Yellen
spoke of a very "modest increase" in interest rates. What's more, she
talked about things she wasn't supposed to mention. If a national
referendum does take place in Scotland, it won't happen before 2024.
However, Boris Johnson promised to uproot that idea. That's the same old
story: we try to get at the root, but we forget about the details. Where
could Papa Carlo get a log if his fireplace wasn't real?

The English are happy about reopening bars and restaurants and seem not
to give a damn about Scotland's eventual independence. So, the British
pound won't probably react either. The year 2024 is too far away to make
them panic right here and right now. The Northern region accounts only
for 8% of the UK GDP. Thus, the divorce might not be as painful as
Brexit, even if British-Scottish relations started much earlier than the
UK-EU ones. I'm afraid it's Scots that may be annoyed after the divorce.

Everyone makes mistakes. Even Janet Yellen does, although her authority
was unquestionable when she was Fed Chair in 2014-2018. The US Finance
Minister shouldn't talk about monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) even if he or she wants
to. Yellen must have accumulated lots of ideas, but public press
conferences and interviews are not for confessions.

> \- Father, I'm a sinner!

>

> \- Do you drink alcohol?

>

> \- I do. But could you hear my confession first?

Unlike Jerome Powell and his FOMC colleagues, Janet Yellen seems to live
in the old world where the central bank does react to strong macro
statistics and raises federal funds rate, thus taking away a cup of
punch at the height of the feast. Why? Not to overheat the economy.
However, life changes. The best way to synchronize with the world is to
change faster.

In contrast to Great Britain, frightened of another divorce, the US is
getting ready for a wedding: the economy's reopening and fast growth. It
buys presents and sends out wedding invitations. The Americans must be
in a holiday mood, which they deserve after an efficient fight with the
pandemic and fast vaccination. I know what it feels like. I enjoyed my
bachelor party so much that I delayed my wedding. I hope the US won't do
that. The global economy won't live that through.
