USDJPY: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 07.05.2021 –
14.05.2021Alex Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 109.68 with a target of 106.75 – 105.77.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
109.68 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 110.95 –
112.50.

 **Analysis:** Daily TM: apparently, a descending correction of larger
degree finished forming as wave B, and wave С started developing, with
the first wave (1) of С forming inside.

On the H4 time frame, the third wave of smaller degree 3 of (1) is
developing, with wave i of 3 formed inside. Apparently, a descending
correction is developing as wave ii of 3 on the H1 time frame, with wave
(a) of ii and wave (b) of ii completed inside. If the presumption is
correct, the pair will continue to drop to the levels of 106.75 –
105.77. The level of 109.68 is critical in this scenario as the breakout
will enable the pair to continue growing to the levels of 110.95 –
112.50.
