Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 07.05.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

The Ripple market is forming an impulse pattern, which suggests further
growth. The Ethereum has completed a large impulse and should soon start
declining in a new bear trend.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

In late April, the BTCUSD market started developing the initial part of
the bear trend. There must be forming an impulse wave composed of five
sub-waves 1-2-3-4-5. There have completed the first two legs of this
wave, impulse 1 and double zigzag 2. Therefore, the price should be
declining in the third wave, composed of five sub-waves of a smaller
degree [1]-[2]-[3]-[4]-[5]. That is, the price will be going down in
impulse [3] to a level below 47000.00.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Sell 56045.00, TP 47000.00

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

The hourly timeframe of the XRPUSD chart displays the beginning of a
large impulse wave. There have finished the first two parts of the
impulse wave, they are impulse [1] and correction [2], completed as a
simple zigzag. The market has also completed the sub-waves of a smaller
degree, (1) and (2), and the sub-waves 1 and 2, which are the elements
of the impulse wave (3). The price could continue rising in wave (3) to
a level above the high of 1.961. One could enter buy trades in the
current situation.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] today:

Buy 1.558, TP 1.961

## Elliott wave Ethereum analysis

The ETHUSD market has been rising in the final leg of the global impulse
wave C for more than a month. Most likely, this wave has completed, and
the market is forming the beginning of a new bear trend. Over the next
few days, the price should be declining. The first target to set a take
profit is level 2855.00, marked by correction (4). One could enter sell
trades in the current situation.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Sell 3431.41, TP 2855.00
