XAUUSD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 07.05.2021 –
14.05.2021Alex Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions from corrections above the
level of 1770.30 with a target of 1851.32 – 1877.16.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
1770.30 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of
1722.72 – 1675.55.

 **Analysis:** An ascending third wave of larger degree (3) formed on
the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame, and a descending correction developed as wave (4),
supposedly. H4 time frame: the fifth wave (5) appears to be forming,
with the first wave of smaller degree 1 of (5) forming inside.
Apparently, the third wave iii of 1 finished developing, corrective wave
iv of 1 of (5) is completed, and wave v of 1 is forming on the H1 time
frame. If the presumption is correct, the pair will continue to rise to
the levels of 1851.32 – 1877.16. The level of 1770.30 is critical in
this scenario as its breakout will enable the pair to continue declining
to the levels of 1722.72 – 1675.55.
