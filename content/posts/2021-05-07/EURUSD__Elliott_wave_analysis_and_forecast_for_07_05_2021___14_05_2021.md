EURUSD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 07.05.2021 –
14.05.2021Alex Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 1.2342 with a target of 1.1600 – 1.1489 once a correction is
completed.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
1.2342 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 1.2500 –
1.2600.

 **Analysis:** Daily time frame: presumably, the first wave of larger
degree 1 of (3) has formed, and a downside correction is forming as wave
2 of (3). Apparently, wave a of 2 has formed and ascending wave b of 2
is developing on the H4 time frame. On the H1 time frame, supposedly,
wave of smaller degree (a) of b and wave (b) of b formed, and wave (c)
of b is developing. If this assumption is correct, the pair may be
expected to continue falling to the levels of 1.1600 – 1.1489 once wave
b of 2 is completed. The level of 1.2342 is critical in this scenario.
Its breakout will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of
1.2500 – 1.2600.
