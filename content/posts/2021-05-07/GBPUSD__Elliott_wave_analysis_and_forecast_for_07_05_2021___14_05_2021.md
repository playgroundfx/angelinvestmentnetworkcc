GBPUSD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 07.05.2021 –
14.05.2021Alex Geuta

 **Main scenario:** consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 1.4237 with a target of 1.3572 – 1.3446 once a correction is
completed.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
1.4237 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 1.4450 –
1.4700.

 **Analysis:** Daily time frame: presumably, the first wave of larger
degree (1) finished developing, with wave 5 of (1) formed inside. A
descending correction started developing as wave (2) on the H4 time
frame, with wave A of (2) formed inside. Apparently, wave B of (2) is
developing on the H1 time frame, with wave a of B and wave b of B formed
and wave c of B developing inside. If this assumption is correct, the
pair will continue to fall to 1.3572 – 1.3446 after the corrective wave
B of (2) is completed. The level of 1.4237 is critical in this scenario
as the breakout will enable the pair to continue rising to the levels of
1.4450 – 1.4700.
