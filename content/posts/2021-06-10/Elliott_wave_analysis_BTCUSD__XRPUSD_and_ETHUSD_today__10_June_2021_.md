Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 10.06.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

In the ETHUSD market, the final wave of the zigzag correction takes the
form of an ending diagonal.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

The BTCUSD market is developing an upward corrective wave [2] as a
zigzag (A) - (B) - (C), where (A) is an impulse, and corrective wave (B)
has a triangular structure and consists of five sub-waves A-B-C-D-E. A
bullish impulse wave C is currently unfolding and may complete its
pattern around level 44500.00. At this level, wave [2] will reach the
Fibonacci level of 50% of the bear impulse wave [1]. In the current
situation, consider entering buy trades.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 37037.50, TP 44500.00

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

The XRPUSD market is unfolding an upward linking wave (X) as part of the
bear double zigzag. Wave (X) is likely to take the shape of a simple
A-B-C zigzag. Long-term corrective wave B, which has taken the form of a
double zigzag [W] - [X] - [Y], looks completed. The XRPUSD market is
developing an upward wave C, which may take the form of a simple
impulse. It is expected to be completed at the level of 1.153. At this
level, wave (X) will reach the Fibonacci level of 38.2% of wave (W).

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] today:

Buy 0.893, TP 1.153

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

The ETHUSD market continues forming corrective wave 2. This wave is
likely unfolding as a simple zigzag, consisted of green sub-waves [A] -
[B] - [C]. The first two parts of this figure are completed, and now the
last wave [C] is developing. Wave [C] is an ending diagonal because its
fourth wave has gone beyond the end of wave (1). Now the initial part of
the wave (5) is unfolding, which may end near the level of 3340.00. At
this level, wave 2 will reach the Fibonacci level of 61.8% of wave 1.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Buy 2562.83, TP 3340.00
