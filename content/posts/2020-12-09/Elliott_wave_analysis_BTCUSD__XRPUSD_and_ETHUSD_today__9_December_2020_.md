Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 09.12.2020Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I suggest entry signals
to trade each cryptocurrency.

Al the three cryptocurrency pairs must have completed the corrective
waves, and the prices should be rising soon.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

 ****

The BTCUSD market has been forming the upward impulse wave C since early
October 2020. There is now forming the final leg of the C wave, that is
the bullish impulse wave [5]. The long corrective wave (4) must have
completed. Wave (4) consists of three sub-waves a-b-c, where the b
correction is a double zigzag. Therefore, the price should be rising in
wave (5) to a level above 19458.52.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 18202.00 TP 19458.52

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

 ****

There is forming the final leg of the simple zigzag A-B-C. In the
impulse wave C, there have finished the sub-waves [1]-[2]-[3], and the
corrective wave [4] is about to end soon. Correction [4] is a horizontal
triangle (a)-(b)-(c)-(d)-(e). Therefore, the price should be growing in
wave [5] above the level of 0.625. One could enter buy positions in the
current situation.

### Trading plan for **[XRPUSD][2]** today:

Buy 0.554, TP 0.625

## Elliott wave Ethereum analysis

 ****

The ETHUSD market has been forming the upward impulse wave C, composed
of five sub-waves, over the past two months. The first four legs of the
C wave have finished, and wave [5] is yet forming. The market should
have completed the long correction (4) as a triple zigzag. So, the price
should be rising in wave (5). The market could be rising to a level
above 606.67, marked by wave xx.

### Trading plan for  **[ETHUSD][3] **today:

Buy 547.81, TP 606.67
