Dollar is in search of safety. Forecast as of 21.09.2021Dmitri Demidenko

The stock market is responsive to the talks about potential defaults of
the USA and China’s real estate giant Evergrande. Forex traders are
focused on the Fed’s [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). Let us discuss the Forex outlook and make
up a [EURUSD][1] trading plan.

## Weekly US dollar fundamental forecast

Like Janet Yellen cannot deliver a precise deadline for the default,
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s cannot determine when the market turmoil will end. The [S&P
500][2] plunged 2.5%, its worst drop since March. The index is on track
for its worst monthly performance since September 2020, and Morgan
Stanley warns of growing risks of its 20% drawdown. Investors are
searching for safety, and the USD index is up to the zone of August
highs. However, the [EURUSD][1] has found support in the zone of
1.17-1.1715

### Dynamics of USD index

Of course, in financial markets, everything is interconnected, and
exchange rates are determined by capital flows. Nevertheless, there are
always two currencies in any pair, and the euro currently has some
benefits. The epidemiological situation in the EU looks better than in
the USA, the euro-area economy is not going to slow down in the third
quarter, unlike the US one, and the elections in Germany may change
approaches to fiscal discipline.

Opinion polls suggest that Social __Democrat leader Olaf Scholz, who
prioritizes spending increases over quick debt reduction, will take over
as German Chancellor. Germany sets the tone for the rest of Europe, so
the principles of fiscal consolidation in the EU could be abandoned. And
this, in turn, is fraught with an increase in budget expenditures and
GDP acceleration.

Markets continue discussing rumours that the ECB may raise interest
rates earlier than currently assumed. According to the Financial Times
source familiar with the matter, the chief economist of the central bank
Philip Lane said in a private conversation with German businessmen that
by the end of the three-year forecast period, the euro-area inflation
would reach the target of 2% on a stable basis. The European regulator
denied this information, stressing that the idea of a rate hike in 2023
does not correspond to its forecasts. However, there is no smoke without
fire.

Treasury yields do not grow, pressing down the US dollar. Despite high
inflation, a strong report on retail sales, and expectations of the QE
tapering, Treasury yields have stalled. Some analysts suggest that even
a reduction in the Fed’s asset purchases will not drive the Treasury
yields higher amid the high demand of foreigners for the US bonds. In
August, foreign [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s bought 25% and 22% of 10-year and 2-year
securities at auctions, the highest level in three years and since
December 2019.

### Weekly[ EURUSD][3] trading plan

Unlike the stock market, Forex is gradually calming down. The stock
market is shaken by the US potential default due to the problems with
the national debt ceiling and growing fears of China Evergrande
defaulting. However, Forex traders are focused on the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).
Will the Fed announce QE tapering in September? How will FOMC forecasts
for the interest rate change? [As I suggested][4], the [EURUSD][1]
should be consolidating ahead of the Fed meeting. The trading range
should be 1.171-1.177. I do not recommend entering any trades.
