Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 21.09.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

There are new targets for BTCUSD and ETHUSD price movements. Let us
explore the market situation for each cryptocurrency pair in detail in
the hourly timeframe.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

After the BTCUSD market had completed the long-term corrective wave [B],
composed of sub-waves (A)-(B)-(C), it started forming a bearish wave as
an impulse. Correction 2 must have finished as a triple zigzag, so the
Bitcoin price should continue declining in impulse wave 3 to a level
below 37233.00. I recommend selling the pair in the current situation.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Sell 42449.00, TP 37233.00

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

The XRPUSD market is forming a down wave that started after the
completion of the linking wave (X). Sub-waves 1 and 2 have finished, and
there is unfolding the third sub-wave. Within the third sub-wave, waves
[1]-[2] of a smaller degree have completed, and there should be
developing wave [3]. The Ripple price could go down to a level of 0.805.
One could enter sell trades in the current situation.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] **** today:

Sell 0.930, TP 0.805

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

After corrective wave B had completed, the ETHUSD market started moving
down. There should be forming a bearish impulse wave. The first two sub-
waves, impulse 1 and correction 2, composed of sub-waves [W]-[X]-[Y],
finished. There is unfolding the down wave 3 as an impulse
[1]-[2]-[3]-[4]-[5], as outlined in the chart. The Ethereum price should
be going down in sub-wave [3] to a level below 2520.00.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Sell 2971.56, TP 2520.00
