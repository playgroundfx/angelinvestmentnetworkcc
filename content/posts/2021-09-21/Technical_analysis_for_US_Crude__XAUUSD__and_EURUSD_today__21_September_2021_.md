Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 21.09.21Alex Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

The euro continues trading in the short-term downtrend.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

The oil price has not broken out the key support of the short-term
uptrend at 70.32 - 70.07. It is still relevant to buy. The nearest
resistance is Additional Zone 71.07 – 70.94. If the market breaks out
Additional Zone, it will continue rising with the target in Target Zone
2, 72.85 - 72.32.

If Addition Zone is not broken out, the trend could turn down. If the
price breaks out Intermediary Zone 70.32 – 70.07, the oil short-term
trend will reverse down, and it will be relevant to sell down to the
target in Target Zone 67.77 — 67.26.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

Sell according to the pattern in Additional Zone 71.07 - 70.94.
TakeProfit: 69.70. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

Gold reached the key resistance of the short-term downtrend at 1765 –
1762. It is still relevant to sell. Enter sell trades according to the
pattern with the target at yesterday’s low.

If Intermediary Zone is broken out upside and the price consolidates
above the zone at the US session, the gold short-term trend will turn
up. If so, it will be relevant to buy with a target at Target Zone 1787
— 1783.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

Sell according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 1765 - 1762.
TakeProfit: 1743. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

EURUSD is still trading down in the short term. Yesterday bears tried to
break out Target Zone 1.1733 – 1.1715 but failed. The price closed in
the medium-term support zone at the US session.

The price is being corrected up in the short-term downtrend. The
correction target is Additional Zone 1.1748 – 1.1744. After the price
tests Additional Zone, I suggest entering short trades in the trend with
the target at yesterday’s low 1.1701.

It will be relevant to buy the euro when bulls break out Additional Zone
and consolidate the price above. If so, one could enter a long with a
target in Intermediary Zone 1.1797 - 1.1788.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

Sell according to the pattern in Additional Zone 1.1748 - 1.1744.
TakeProfit: 1.1701. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.
