EUR/USD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 10/04/2020 –
17/04/2020Alex Geuta

## The [EUR/USD][1] pair is correcting, still likely to grow. Estimated
pivot point is at a level of 1.0768.

 **Main scenario:** long positions should be considered from corrections
above the level of 1.0768 with a target of 1.1170 – 1.1241.

 **Alternative scenario:** ****breakout and consolidation below the
level of 1.0768 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels
of 1.0500 – 1.0327.

 **Analysis:** Supposedly, the descending fifth wave of larger degree
(5) of С continues developing on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame, with the first
wave 1 of (5) formed inside. On the 4-hour time frame, a local
correction finished developing in the form of wave 2 of (5) and wave 3
of (5) started forming. On the H1 time frame, apparently, the first wave
of smaller degree i of 3 formed and an ascending correction is forming
as wave ii of 3, with wave (c) of ii starting to form inside. If the
presumption is correct, the pair will continue to rise to the levels of
1.1170 – 1.1241. The level of 1.0768 is critical in this scenario. Its
breakout will allow the pair to continue falling to the levels of 1.0500
– 1.0327.
