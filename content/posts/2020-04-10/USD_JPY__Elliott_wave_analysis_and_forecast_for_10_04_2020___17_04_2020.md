USD/JPY: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 10/04/2020 –
17/04/2020Alex Geuta

## The pair [USD/JPY][1] remains likely to fall. Estimated pivot point
is at a level of 111.76.

 **Main scenario:** short positions should be considered from
corrections below the level of 111.76 with a target of 101.08 – 98.73.

 **Alternative scenario:** ****breakout and consolidation above the
level of 111.76 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of
114.53 – 118.00.

 **Analysis:** On the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame, supposedly, a big horizontal
correction finished forming as a triangle-shaped wave (В) of B. On the
H4 time frame, wave (С) of B started developing, with the first wave  i
of 1 of (C) formed  and a local correction completed in the form of wave
ii of 1 of (C) inside. Apparently, wave iii of 1 of (C) is starting to
develop on the H1 time frame.  If this assumption is correct, the pair
will continue to drop to 101.08 – 98.73. The level of 111.76 is critical
in this scenario as the breakout will enable the pair to continue
growing to the levels of 114.53 – 118.00.
