Weekly forecast for oil, gold and EUR/USDAlex Rodiоnov

###  **USCrude –** **oil**

Oil medium-term trend reversed up last week. There is a false breakout
pattern in the chart that confirms the trading idea to buy oil.

The price is now testing Target Zone [23.29 – 22.73], the trend key
support. Next week, I recommend looking for buy entries in this zone
according to the pattern. The buy target will be Target Zone 2 [30.75 –
30.19].

It will be relevant to sell oil when sellers break out and consolidate
the price below. In this case, the sell target will be the lower Target
Zone 2 [17.69 — 17.13].

Target Zone 2 [30.75 - 30.19]. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

###  **XAUUSD – gold**

This week, gold has reached the strong resistance to the uptrend, Target
Zone 4 [1697.2 - 1691.2]. Therefore, all buy targets have been reached.

Next week, the main scenario will be oil purchases, the trend key
support is in the range of [1606.6 – 1598.2].

Expect the price correction down to the key support and enter new
purchases according to the pattern. The target for these future buy
trades will be to break through the local high.

###  **EURUSD – euro/dollar**

The EUR/USD medium-term downtrend continues. Traders are now testing the
trend key resistance, Target Zone [1.0957 - 1.0940]. Next week, I
recommend entering sell trades in the resistance zone with the target at
the low of this week. To enter sell trades, there must be a sell pattern
to confirm the idea.

There is also an alternative scenario: the price breaks out Target Zone
and consolidates above, the trend reverses up. In this case, we shall
buy the euro versus dollar with the target at Target Zone 2 [1.1129 —
1.1112].

Sell according to the pattern in Target Zone [1.0957 - 1.0940].
TakeProfit: 1.0773. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

> IZ - Intermediary Zone: responsible for the price momentum reversing

>

> TZ - Target Zone: a zone that is 75% likely to be reached after IZ
breakout.

> GZ - Gold Zone: zone in the medium-term momentum.
