GBP/USD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 10/04/2020 –
17/04/2020Alex Geuta

## The [GBP/USD][1] pair is correcting, still likely to fall. Estimated
pivot point is at a level of 1.2738.

 **Main scenario:** short positions will be relevant from corrections
below the level of 1.2738 with a target of 1.1177 – 1.0687 once the
correction is completed.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
1.2738 will allow the pair to continue the rise up to the levels of
1.3201 – 1.3509.

 **Analysis:** Supposedly, the fifth wave of larger degree V continues
developing on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame, with a correction completed in the
form of wave (2) of V inside. The third wave (3) of V is developing on
the H4 time frame, with wave 3 of (3) formed and a correction developing
as wave 4 of (3) inside. Apparently, the ultimate wave c of 4 of (3) is
forming on the H1 time frame.  If this assumption is correct, the pair
will continue to fall to the levels of 1.1177 – 1.0687 once the
correction’s over. The level of 1.2738 is critical in this scenario as
the breakout will enable the pair to continue rising to the levels of
1.3201 – 1.3509.
