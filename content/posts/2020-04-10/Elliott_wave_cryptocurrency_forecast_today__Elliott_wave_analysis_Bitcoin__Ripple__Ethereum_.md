## Elliott wave forecast for BTCUSD, ETHUSD, XRPUSD for today

###  **Elliott wave[BTCUSD][1] analysis**

 **![LiteForex: Elliott wave cryptocurrency forecast today. Elliott wave
analysis Bitcoin, Ripple, Ethereum.][2]**

Presumably, the corrective wave [4] has completed as a triple zigzag in
the down impulse wave A. The BTCUSD is now declining in wave [5] that
may complete as a simple impulse. The first two portions of this impulse
are likely to have completed. In the next few days, the price should
continue declining in this impulse to a level below the previous low,
that is below level 3777.0.

After the final segment of the triple zigzag [4], the ending diagonal c
of (z), completed, the market has been declining. There is likely to be
forming the initial part of the bear impulse wave [5]. There have formed
its two first parts, sub-waves, (1) and (2), so, the price should
continue declining in the next few days.

The upward corrective wave [4] is likely to have completed as a triple
zigzag within the final bear impulse (C). After that, the market has
started declining in wave [5] that may complete as a simple impulse. The
first two sub-waves of this impulse may have completed. The price should
continue declining in the next few days.
