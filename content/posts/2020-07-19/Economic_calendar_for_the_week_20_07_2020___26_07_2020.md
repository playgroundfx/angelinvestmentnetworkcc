Economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the week 20.07.2020 – 26.07.2020Jana Kane

##  **Overview of the main events of the Forex economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the
next trading week 20.07.2020 to 26.07.2020**

 **Trading on key Forex [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/): we are expecting the publication of
important macro statistics from Canada, Germany, Eurozone, UK, as well
as the results of the meeting of the People's Bank of China and its
decision on the interest rate.**

American and European stock indices closed last week in the positive
territory. Despite the signals that the American economy will face new
challenges, S&P500 rose 1.1% and almost completely won back the
positions it lost in 2020.

On the one hand, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are concerned about the exacerbation of the
conflict between the United States and China, as well as the further
spread of the coronavirus and the economic consequences of the pandemic,
and on the other hand, they are encouraged by [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) of successes in the
development of vaccines and data on the restoration of business activity
in those regions where the authorities have relaxed the quarantine. In
addition, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are counting on central banks and governments to
provide additional support to businesses and consumers.

"The Fed is working tirelessly to overcome the economic damage caused by
the coronavirus and put the economy back on track to meet our goals of
maximum employment and price stability," the President of the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York and chairman of the Fed's Open Market Committee
John Williams said on Thursday. “I don’t think now is the time to think
about exit strategies. We are still in a very difficult situation,”
Williams said.

The meetings of the three largest world central banks (the Bank of
Japan, the Bank of Canada and the ECB) held last week did not lead to a
radical change in the mood of financial market participants.

The heads of these central banks spoke of the high risks to the global
economy as a result of the the coronavirus pandemic and pledged to
continue to stimulate and support the economy.

The dollar continued to decline last week, and gold went on to trade
near the previously reached highs around 1818.00 dollars per ounce.

Gold is increasing despite the growth of stock indices, which is
facilitated by both the soft [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of world central banks and the
uncertainty about the strength of the upward trend in stock indices in
the context of the ongoing trade conflict between the United States and
China, as well as the further spread of the coronavirus. Last week, the
number of people infected with coronavirus in the United States exceeded
3.737 million people.

Next week will not be heavily loaded with important macro statistics.
However, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s will nevertheless pay attention to the publication of
important macro data from Canada, Germany, the Eurozone, UK, as well as
to the results of the meeting of the People's Bank of China and its
decision on the interest rate.

 _ **Traders should pay attention to the following significant
macroeconomic data expected next week:**_

 *** during the coming week new events may be added to the [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) and
scheduled events may be canceled**

 ****** **GMT time**

###  **Sunday, July 19**

###  **23:50 JPY Bank of Japan Monetary Policy Committee meeting**

At this meeting, the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Japan will
once again summarize the results of the last week's meeting of the Bank,
analyze the economic situation in Japan and give indications on possible
future prospects for the Bank of Japan's financial [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).

If the tone of the minutes of the meeting indicates the firmness of
intentions of the Bank of Japan regarding monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) in the
country, it will negatively affect the Japanese stock market and
strengthen the yen. Conversely, soft rhetoric about the bank's monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) prospects will help weaken the yen and boost the Japanese stock
market.

###  **Monday, June 20**

###  **01:30 CNY Decision of the People's Bank of China on the interest
rate**

Since May 2012, the People's Bank of China has been steadily cutting
interest rates to support Chinese manufacturers. The last time, the bank
lowered the rate in April 2020 (by 0.20% to 3.85% at the moment).

In recent months, amid international trade conflicts and a slowdown in
the global economy, the world's largest central banks have been moving
towards softening their monetary policies in order to support national
economies and increase the competitiveness of goods exported from these
countries.

The People's Bank of China is also in line with this process. The
depreciation of the yuan became especially relevant in the last 2 years,
when the confrontation between the two most powerful economies in the
world began. One of the measures to neutralize the negative consequences
of the increased duties on the import of Chinese goods into the United
States was the depreciation of the national currency of China. Such a
measure was intended, among other things, to maintain the same volumes
of imports of Chinese products to the United States, which would cost
American buyers less due to the difference in the rates of the national
currencies of the United States and China.

Now, another strong negative factor has been added to this - the
coronavirus pandemic.

Probably, at this meeting, the People's Bank of China will keep the
interest rate at the same level of 3.85%, although a rate cut is also
possible.

However, if the People's Bank of China makes unexpected statements or
decisions, volatility may increase throughout the financial market.
Investors will also be interested in the bank's assessment of the
consequences of the coronavirus for the Chinese economy and its [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
in the near future in this regard.

###  **Tuesday, July 21**

###  **01:30 AUD Minutes of the July meeting of the RB of Australia**

This document is published two weeks after the meeting and the decision
on the interest rate. If the RBA positively assesses the state of the
labor market in the country, the rate of GDP growth, and also shows a
hawkish attitude towards the inflationary forecast in the economy, the
markets regard this as a higher probability of a rate hike at the next
meeting, which is a positive factor for the AUD. The bank's soft
rhetoric regarding, above all, inflation puts pressure on the AUD.

At its July 7 meeting, the central bank kept its current monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
unchanged. The key interest rate of the RBA was kept at a record low
level of 0.25%, and the target level of yield on 3-year government bonds
was also left at the level of 0.25%. The decision to lower the rate and
set the current target for government bond yields was taken at the
unscheduled RBA meeting on March 19 to support businesses and Australian
citizens amid the rapid spread of the coronavirus pandemic. The
country's government was also forced to introduce a social distancing
regime, suspend businesses and close borders to international traffic.

“Substantial uncertainty remains about the short-term outlook for the
Australian economy,” RBA Governor Philip Lowe said after the bank
meeting, adding that “the board will not raise rates until there is
progress towards full employment and confidence that inflation will
stabilize within the target range of 2-3% ". In his opinion, "there are
no serious arguments in favor of tightening monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) in the short
term," and "some time will pass before interest rates rise."

Nevertheless, if the published minutes contain unexpected information
regarding the RBA's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), the volatility in the AUD quotes
will increase.

###  **02:30 AUD Speech by the head of the RBA Philip Lowe**

In his speech, Philip Lowe will assess the current situation in the
Australian economy and point out further plans for the monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
of the agency. Any signals from him regarding a change in the plans of
the RBA's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) will cause a sharp increase in volatility in
the AUD trading and on the Australian stock market. If he does not touch
on the topic of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), then the market reaction to his speech
will be weak.

Market participants would also like to hear Lowe's views on central bank
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and the first recession in
Australia in 30 years.

In July, the RBA's key interest rate was kept at a record low of 0.25%,
and the target level of yield on 3-year government bonds was also left
at 0.25%. The decision to lower the rate and determine the current
target level of government bond yields was made at an unscheduled RBA
meeting on March 19 in order to support business and Australian citizens
amid the rapid spread of the coronavirus pandemic.

###  **12:30 CAD Retail Sales Index**

The Retail Sales Index is published monthly by Statistics Canada and
estimates total retail sales. The index is often considered an indicator
of consumer confidence and reflects the health of the retail sector in
the near term. A rise in the index is usually positive for the CAD; a
decrease in the indicator will negatively affect the CAD. The previous
value of the index (in April) was +19.1% after falling by -9.9% in
March. If the data for May turns out to be weaker than the previous
value, the CAD may sharply decline in the short term.

###  **Wednesday, July 22**

###  **12:30 CAD Consumer price indices in Canada**

The Bank of Canada's Core Consumer Price Index (Core CPI) reflects the
dynamics of the retail prices of the corresponding basket of goods and
services (excluding fruits, vegetables, gasoline, fuel oil, natural gas,
mortgage interest, intercity transportation, and tobacco products). The
target inflation rate for the Bank of Canada is in the range of 1-3%.
The rise in CPI is a harbinger of a rate hike and a positive factor for
the CAD. Core CPI rose in May by +0.7% (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)), and in April -
by +1.2%. If the data for June turns out to be worse than the previous
values, it will negatively affect the CAD. Better-than-expected data and
above previous values ​​will strengthen the Canadian dollar.

Forecast for June: Consumer Price Index will come out with a value of
-0.3% (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)), Core CPI - with a value of +0.9%.

###  **Thursday, July 23**

Japan celebrates the National Ocean Day. The banks in this country will
be closed, due to which the trading volumes during the Asian session
will be reduced.

There is also no publication of important macro statistics, which can
significantly affect the dynamics of the markets, on this day.

However, traders should pay attention to the publication at 12:30 of
data on the number of new (initial) jobless claims in the US over the
past week. The situation on the country's labor market continues to
deteriorate. Back in February, the indicator of initial claims for
unemployment benefits was within its average values ​​of 193-252
thousand. However, then the situation began to deteriorate sharply.
During the week of March 22-28, 6.9 million claims were filed, followed
by 6.606 million claims, shocking observers and market participants. The
similar indicator published last Thursday (for the week of July 5 - 10)
came out with a value of 1.3 million claims.

Published in early May, the US Department of Labor data showed an
increase in unemployment in the country to the level of 14.7%.
Economists attribute this to the coronavirus, which has damaged the US
economy. Many US companies have announced layoffs, and the authorities
have ordered non-vital companies to close their offices and stores due
to the coronavirus epidemic. The current weekly filing growth rate is
well above the previous record high of 695,000 reached in October 1982.
Then the number of initial claims filed in four weeks was 2.7 million.

This indicator (initial jobless claims) reflects the state of the labor
market. The rise in value has a negative impact on consumption levels
and economic growth. Under normal circumstances, a high value weakens
the US dollar and a low score strengthens it. However, in the current
environment (the coronavirus pandemic and a sharp economic slowdown),
the reaction of market participants to the publication of this report of
the US Department of Labor can be completely unpredictable.

###  **Friday, July 24**

Japan celebrates national Health and Sports Day. The banks in this
country will be closed, due to with which the trading volumes during the
Asian session will be reduced.

###  **07:30 EUR Markit Economics Manufacturing PMI (preliminary
release). Markit Economics Composite PMI (preliminary release)**

Germany's manufacturing PMI is an important indicator of the business
environment and the overall health of the German economy. This sector of
the economy forms a significant part of Germany's GDP. A result above 50
is seen as positive and strengthens the EUR, below 50 as negative for
the euro. Forecast for July (preliminary release): 41.5.

Previous values: 45.2 in June, 36.6 in May, 34.5 in April, 45.4 in
March, 48 in February, 45.3 in January, which indicates a prolonged
slowdown in business activity in this sector of the German economy, as
the value of the indicator is below 50. The growth of the indicator
above the previous value may support the euro (in the short term),
although its value is still below the value of 50. The data worse than
the forecast will have a negative impact on the euro.

Composite PMI for the German economy is an important indicator of the
business environment and the overall health of the German economy. A
result above 50 is seen as positive and strengthens the EUR, below 50 as
negative for the euro. Forecast for July (preliminary release): 44.2 vs.
47.0 in June, 32.3 in May, 17.4 in April, 35 in March, 50.7 in February,
51.2 in January. The publication of this indicator with the specified
expected value is unlikely to strongly support the euro. The data worse
than the forecast and below the value of 50.0, as a rule, have a
negative impact on the euro.

###  **08:00 EUR Markit Economics Composite Manufacturing PMI
(preliminary release)**

Eurozone's Composite Manufacturing PMI is an important indicator of the
health of the entire European economy. A result above 50 is seen as
positive and strengthens the EUR, one below 50 as negative for the euro.
Forecast for July (preliminary release): 59.0 (versus 48.5 in June, 31.9
in May, 13.6 in April, 29.7 in March, 51.6 in February, 51.3 in January)
which is likely to have a positive effect on the euro. If the data turn
out to be worse than the forecast, the euro may fall sharply in the
short term.

###  **08:30 GBP Markit Economics Services PMI (preliminary release)**

UK's Services PMI is an important indicator of the health of the UK
economy. The services sector employs most of the UK's working-age
population and accounts for approximately 78% of GDP. Financial services
remain the most important part of the service sector. If the data turns
out to be worse than the forecast and the previous value, the pound is
likely to drop sharply in the short term. The data better than the
forecast and the previous value will have a positive impact on the
pound. At the same time, a result above 50 is seen as positive and
strengthens the GBP, one below 50 as negative for the GBP.

Previous values ​​of the indicator: 47.1 in June, 29.0 in May, 13.4 in
April, 34.5 in March, 53.2 in February, 53.9 in January. Preliminary
forecast for July: 47.0.
