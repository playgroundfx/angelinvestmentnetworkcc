USD/JPY: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 07/08/2020 –
14/08/2020Alex Geuta

## [USD/JPY][1] remains likely to grow. Estimated pivot point is at a
level of 104.17.

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions from corrections above the
level of 104.17 with a target of 107.50 – 108.13.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
104.17 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of 103.50
– 102.50.

 **Analysis:** On the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame, apparently a descending
correction of larger degree finished forming as wave B and wave С
started developing, with wave 1 of (1) of C formed inside.  On the H4
time frame, a descending correction has formed as wave 2 of (1) in the
form of double zigzag wxy, and the third wave 3 of (1) is starting to
develop. Apparently, the first counter-trend wave of smaller degree (i)
of i of 3 has formed on the H1 time frame, and a local correction has
been completed in the form of wave (ii) of i of 3. If the presumption is
correct, the pair may be expected to rise to the  levels of 107.50 –
108.13.  The level of 104.17 is critical in this scenario as the
breakout will enable the pair to continue declining to the levels of
103.50 – 102.50.
