XAU/USD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 07/08/2020 –
14/08/2020Alex Geuta

## [XAU/USD][1] is likely to fall into a correction. Estimated pivot
point is at a level of  2074.60.

 **Main scenario:** consider short positions below the level of 2074.60
with a target of 2007.60 – 1967.22.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
2074.60 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 2130.03
– 2200.00.

 **Analysis:** The ascending third wave of larger degree (3) presumably
continues developing on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame, with wave 5 of (3) forming
inside.  Apparently, the third wave of smaller degree iii of 5 is
forming on the H4 time frame, with wave (iii) of iii formed inside.
Supposedly, a downward correction is starting to form as the fourth wave
(iv) of iii on the H1 time frame. If this assumption is correct, the
pair may be expected to fall to the levels of 2007.60 – 1967.22. The
level of  2074.60 is critical in this scenario as the breakout will
enable the pair to continue growing to the levels of 2130.03 – 2200.00.
