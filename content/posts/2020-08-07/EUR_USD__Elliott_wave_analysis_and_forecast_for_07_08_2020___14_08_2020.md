EUR/USD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 07/08/2020 –
14/08/2020Alex Geuta

## The pair [EUR/USD][1] is likely to fall under correction. Estimated
pivot point is at a level of 1.1920.

 **Main scenario:** consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 1.1920 with a target of 1.1695 – 1.1644.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
1.1920 will allow the pair to continue the rise up to the levels of
1.2050 – 1.2200.

 **Analysis:** A descending correction of larger degree presumably
finished developing on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame in the form of wave (2), and
the third wave (3) started developing. On the H4 time frame, the first
counter-trend wave 1 of (3) is forming, with wave iii of 1 presumably
formed inside. Apparently, a downward correction is starting to form as
the fourth wave  iv of 1 of (3) on the H1 time frame. If this assumption
is correct, the pair may be expected to fall to the levels of 1.1695 –
1.1644. The level of 1.1920 is critical in this scenario. Its breakout
will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 1.2050 – 1.2200.
