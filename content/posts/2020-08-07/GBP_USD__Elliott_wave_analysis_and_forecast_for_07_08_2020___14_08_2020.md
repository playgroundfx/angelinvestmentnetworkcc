GBP/USD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 07/08/2020 –
14/08/2020Alex Geuta

## The pair [GBP/USD][1] is likely to fall into a correction. Estimated
pivot point is at a level of 1.3185.

 **Main scenario:** consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 1.3185 with a target of 1.2953 – 1.2892.

 **Alternative scenario:**   breakout and consolidation above the level
of 1.3185 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 1.3285
– 1.3515.

 **Analysis:** Presumably the third wave of larger degree (3) continues
developing on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame, with wave 3 of (3) forming inside.
Presumably, the third wave of smaller degree iii of 3 of (3) is forming
on  Apparently, a downward correction is starting to form as the fourth
wave (iv) of iii on the H1 time frame. If this assumption is correct,
the pair may be expected to fall to the levels of 1.2953 – 1.2892.  The
level of 1.3185 is critical in this scenario as the breakout will enable
the pair to continue rising to the levels of 1.3285 – 1.3515.
