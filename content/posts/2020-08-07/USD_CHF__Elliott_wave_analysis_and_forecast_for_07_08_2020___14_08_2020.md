USD/CHF: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 07/08/2020 –
14/08/2020Alex Geuta

## [USDCHF][1] remains likely to correct and grow. Estimated pivot point
is at a level of 0.9044.

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions from corrections above the
level of 0.9044 with a target of 0.9228 – 0.9335.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
0.9044 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of 0.8950
– 0.8800.

 **Analysis:** The descending third wave of larger degree (3) presumably
continues developing on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame, with wave 1 of (3) forming
inside. On the H4 time frame, wave v of 1 is forming, with wave (iii) of
v formed inside, presumably. Apparently, an ascending correction has
started to form as the fourth wave (iv) of v on the H1 time frame. If
this assumption is correct, the pair may be expected to rise to the
levels of 0.9228 – 0.9335. The level of 0.9044 is critical in this
scenario. Its breakout will allow the pair to continue falling to the
levels of 0.8950 – 0.8800.
