Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 02.12.2020Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I suggest entry signals
to trade each cryptocurrency.

Similar to the previous trading days, the cryptocurrency pairs are
forming bullish impulses. Let us study the charts of each cryptocurrency
pair in more detail.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

 ****

There is forming the upward impulse wave C. The market has recently
completed the powerful impulse wave [3], which is an element of the C
wave. Next, following a decline in the corrective wave [4], there has
started the final impulse wave [5]. There is now forming correction (4),
which is about to end soon. Next, the price should continue rising in
wave (5) towards a level of 20000.00, as it is outlined in the chart. It
is relevant to enter purchases in the current situation.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 18433.00. TP 20000.00

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

 ****

The XRPUSD market continues developing the final impulse wave [5], which
is the final leg of the global impulse wave C. There should be forming
the final section of impulse (3). Over the next few days, impulse (3)
could finish and the price will go down in correction (4). The entire
wave [5] could end at a level of around the previous high made by wave
[3], that is, around level 0.795. An approximate trajectory of the
Ripple future price movement is outlined in the chart.

### Trading plan for **[XRPUSD][2]** today:

Buy 0.597, TP 0.795

## Elliott wave Ethereum analysis

 ****

In the most recent chart section, the Ethereum market is forming the
final impulse wave [5] that should conclude the impulse wave C of a
larger degree. There is likely to be forming correction (4) as a zigzag.
It’s likely structure is projected in the chart. The price should go
down a little in correction (4). Next, the market should start growing
in wave (5) towards a level of 665.00. One could enter purchases under
the current conditions.

### Trading plan for  **[ETHUSD][3] **today:

Buy 577.93, TP 665.00
