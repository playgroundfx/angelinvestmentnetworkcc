## Elliott wave forecast for BTCUSD, ETHUSD, XRPUSD for today

###  **Elliott wave[BTCUSD][1] analysis**

![LiteForex: Elliott wave cryptocurrency forecast today. Elliott wave
analysis Bitcoin, Ripple, Ethereum.][2]

The BTCUSD market continues forming a large down zigzag A-B-C. An upward
corrective wave B is unfolding as a triple zigzag. The bear linking wave
[x] may have recently completed as a double zigzag within the B wave,
and there is now developing the final zigzag [z]. Wave [z] is composed
of three sub-waves (a)-(b)-(c). The sub-waves (a) and (b) are likely to
have completed, so, the price should be rising in wave (c) to a level of
7448. This level is the previous high made by the [y] zigzag.

The chart displays the upward corrective wave 4 that is likely to be
finishing. This correction should complete as a triple zigzag. There may
be developing the initial phase of the final wave (c) that may complete
at a level around the previous high made by the [y] zigzag, that is a
level around 0.204. After this level is reached, there may start a new
downtrend as it is outlined in the chart.

###  **Elliott wave[ETHUSD][5] analysis**

Like in the previous trading days, the ETHUSD market continues following
the upward corrective wave 4. Correction 4 should be unfolding as a
triple zigzag [w]-[x]-[y]-[x]-[z], based on its structure. The bear
correction (b) is likely to have completed within the up wave [z]
currently unfolding. Therefore, the market may be rising in the (c) wave
towards a level of 201.29. within the next few days. The (c) wave could
be a plain five-wave impulse.
