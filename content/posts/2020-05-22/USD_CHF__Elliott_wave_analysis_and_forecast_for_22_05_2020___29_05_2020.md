USD/CHF: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 22/05/2020 –
29/05/2020Alex Geuta

## [USD/CHF][1] remains likely to fall. Estimated pivot point is at a
level of 0.9782.

 **Main scenario:** consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 0.9782 with a target of 0.9497 – 0.9167.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
0.9782 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 1.0024 –
1.0235.

 **Analysis:** Supposedly, the third descending wave of larger degree
(3) continues developing on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame, with wave 3 of (3)
forming inside. On the H4 time frame, the first wave of smaller degree i
of 3 formed and a correction finished developing in the form of wave ii
of 3. Apparently, the third wave iii of 3 is developing on the H1 time
frame, with wave (ii) of iii completed and wave (iii) of iii forming
inside. If the presumption is correct, the pair will continue to drop to
the levels of 0.9497 – 0.9167. The level of 0.9782 is critical in this
scenario. Its breakout will allow the pair to continue rising to the
levels of 1.0024 – 1.0235.
