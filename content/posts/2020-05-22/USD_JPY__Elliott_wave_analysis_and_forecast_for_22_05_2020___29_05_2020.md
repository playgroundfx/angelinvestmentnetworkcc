USD/JPY: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 22/05/2020 –
29/05/2020Alex Geuta

## [USD/JPY][1] remains likely to grow. Estimated pivot point is at a
level of 105.96.

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions from corrections above the
level of 105.96 with a target of 109.51 – 111.80.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
105.96 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of 103.00
– 101.08.

 **Analysis:** On the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame, apparently a descending
correction of larger degree finished forming as wave B and wave С
started developing. On the H4 time frame, the first wave 1 of (1) of C
formed and a local correction finished forming as wave 2 of (1).
Apparently, wave 3 of (1) started developing on the H1 time frame. Wave
i of 3 has formed and a descending correction is developing as wave (ii)
of I of 3 inside wave 3 of (1). If this assumption is correct, the pair
will continue to rise to 109.51 – 111.80 after correction. The level of
105.96 is critical in this scenario as the breakout will enable the pair
to continue declining to the levels of 103.00 – 101.08.
