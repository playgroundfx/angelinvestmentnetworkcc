Elliott wave [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) forecast for Bitcoin, Ripple and EthereumRoman Onegin

## Elliott wave forecast for BTCUSD, ETHUSD, XRPUSD for today

###  **Elliott wave[BTCUSD][1] analysis**

 **![LiteForex: Elliott wave cryptocurrency forecast today. Elliott wave
analysis Bitcoin, Ripple, Ethereum.][2]**

The BTCUSD market has continued moving down, so the previous layout is
no longer relevant. Presumably, the corrective wave [4] hasn’t yet
finished. It is developing as a double three (W)-(X)-(Y). The market is
now unfolding the bear wave (Y) that is composed of three main sub-waves
A-B-C. Impulse A and horizontal contracting triangle B have completed,
impulse C is half-complete. Therefore, the price should be declining
towards a level of 8054.39. This is the previous low made by zigzag (W).

The XRPUSD market has also continued moving down, so the (B) has not yet
completed. It is likely to be developing as a double zigzag W-X-Y. The
sub-waves W and X have completed, and there is now developing the bear
wave Y as a simple zigzag made of three waves [A]-[B]-[C]. Therefore,
the price should be following this formation down in the next few days,
as it is outlined in the chart.

###  **Elliott wave[ETHUSD][5] analysis**

Like other major cryptocurrencies, the ETHUSD market continues unfolding
the corrective wave B. Wave B is developing as a double zigzag
[W]-[X]-[Y]. The down zigzag-shaped wave [W] has completed, as well as
the upward linking wave [X] that is composed of the sub-waves
(a)-(b)-(c). There is likely to be forming the bear impulse wave (A)
that is the beginning of the final zigzag [Y]. Therefore, the sub-waves
(A)-(B)-(C) should complete the simple zigzag [Y] in the next few days.
