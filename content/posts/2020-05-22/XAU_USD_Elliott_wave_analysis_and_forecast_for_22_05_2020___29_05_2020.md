XAU/USD:Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 22/05/2020 –
29/05/2020Alex Geuta

## [XAU/USD][1] is likely to fall. Estimated pivot point is at a level
of 1765.45.

 **Main scenario:** consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 1765.45 with a target of  1600.00 – 1565.00.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
1765.45 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 1800.00
– 1850.00.

 **Analysis:** Supposedly, an ascending correction of larger degree
finished developing in the form of wave (B) on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame,
with wave С of (B) formed within. Apparently, the fifth wave v of C
finished developing on the H4 time frame, with wave (v) of v formed
inside. Wave (C) starts developing on the H1 time frame, with the first
counter-trend wave of junior level (i) of i of 1 of (C) forming inside.
If the presumption is correct, the price will continue falling to the
levels of 1600.00 – 1565.00. The level of 1765.45 is critical in this
scenario as the breakout will enable the pair to continue growing to the
levels of 1800.00 – 1850.00.
