Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 24.05.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency

There seems to some time to sell all the three cryptocurrencies, covered
in the article, with a profit.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

Bitcoin completed the corrective wave 2 two weeks ago. Next, the price
continued declining. There could be unfolding the initial part of the
new impulse. The bearish impulse wave [1] seems to end soon; it is
composed of the sub-waves (1)-(2)-(3)-(4)-(5). The first four parts have
finished, and the final, fifth, wave is still unfolding. There must have
started developing the final leg of wave (5). The price could go down to
a level of 29796.51, the previous low marked by wave (3).

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Sell 35422.00, TP 29796.51

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

The XRPUSD marked must be forming the initial part of the large double
zigzag (W)-(X)-(Y). Wave (W) is composed of three major sub-waves A-B-C.
The corrective wave B is a double zigzag. There should be developing the
bear impulse wave C, composed of sub-waves [1]-[2]-[3]-[4]-[5]. There
should be forming the final section of the sub-wave (5) of [5]. The
price could go down to a level of 0.586. Next, the price should start
rising in the linking wave (X) towards a level of 1.187.

## Elliott wave Ethereum analysis

The ETHUSD market situation is similar to that of the BTCUSD. About two
weeks ago, the market has started declining in the initial part of the
bearish impulse. The market is about to finish the first sub-wave 1,
which is a five-wave impulse. The price could be declining to a level of
1630.00. Next, the market should rise in corrective wave 2 to a level of
2991.00, where wave 2 will be 50% of wave 1.

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Sell 2105.80, TP 1630.00
