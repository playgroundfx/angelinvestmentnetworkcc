Short-term analysis for oil, gold, and EURUSD for 24.05.2021Alex
Rodionov

I welcome my fellow traders! I have made a price forecast for US Crude,
XAUUSD, and EURUSD using a combination of margin zones methodology and
technical analysis. Based on the market analysis, I suggest entry
signals for intraday traders.

The Euro is trading between the Target Zone 1.2245 - 1.2227 and the
Intermediary Zone 1.2157 - 1.2148.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Oil price forecast for today: USCrude analysis

Oil price is correcting to a short-term downtrend and is currently
testing the key resistance 64.43 - 64.16. First of all, it is profitable
to look for new oil sales with a target at Friday's low.

If the price breaks out Intermediary Zone and consolidates above at the
US session, the short-term trend will reverse up. In this case, the
target will be the upper Target Zone 67.34 - 66.81, so switch to the
search for purchases.

### [USCrude][1] trading ideas for today:

Sell according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 64.43 - 64.16.
TakeProfit: 61.56. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

## Gold price forecast for today: XAUUSD analysis

Gold traders partially worked out the buy pattern, reaching the
resistance level 1888 on Friday. Further price growth will be possible
if the level is broken out. The target will be Target Zone 2 1903 -
1898.

The price is consolidating under the resistance level of 1888. In case
of a price decline in the Intermediary Zone 1867 - 1865, look for new
purchases. If the Intermediary Zone is broken out, sell the metal with
the target at the lower Target Zone 1845 - 1840.

### [XAUUSD][2] trading ideas for today:

Buy according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 1867 - 1865.
TakeProfit: 1888, Target Zone 2 1903 - 1898. StopLoss: according to the
pattern rules.

## Euro/Dollar forecast for today: EURUSD analysis

The Euro is trading between the Target Zone 1.2245 - 1.2227 and the
Intermediary Zone 1.2157 - 1.2148. The short-term trend is up. There is
no euro buy pattern in the Intermediary Zone, so continue to monitor the
situation. When a buy signal appears, open long trades with the target
at level 1.2239.

If the Intermediary Zone is broken out during the trading session, the
short-term trend will reverse down. In this case, switch to selling the
euro with the target at the lower Target Zone 1.2069 - 1.2051.

### [EURUSD][3] trading ideas for today:

Buy according to the pattern in Intermediary Zone 1.2157 - 1.2148.
TakeProfit: 1.2239. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.
