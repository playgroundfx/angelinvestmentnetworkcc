Euro protects its fansDmitri Demidenko

## Fundamental Euro forecast for today

### The EUR/USD rally signals the success of the euro-area medical
services and management

The pandemic has changed not only the world but view of the world as
well. Earlier, the export-led euro-area economy needed the weak euro.
Now, the surge of the trade-weighted euro doesn’t bother the ECB or the
EU governments. When the common goal is to increase the domestic demand,
not foreign demand, the strong local currency is what they need. The
euro growth means that the management of the crisis resulted from
COVID-19 in Europe is more effective than the US management, and so, the
euro area could exit the recession sooner than the U.S.

### Dynamics of trade-weighted euro

The recession in Europe is deeper than in the USA, however, the recovery
trend is faster. According to Bloomberg, the economic activity in
Germany and France in mid-June was 80-90% of the pre-crisis level
compared with 65% in the USA. The speed of the GDP recovery trend is of
key importance for the capital flows, the demand for the securities
issued in the regions, and for the [EUR/USD][2] price. The euro-area
stock indexes look undervalued compared to the US stocks, and the
capital inflow to Europe from the USA will support the euro.

### Dynamics of EuroStoxx 600 and S&P 500

One could doubt the euro strength amid the ECB €1.35 trillion pandemic
emergency purchase program and ultra-low interest rates. However, the
Fed’s monetary stimulus is bigger. The decision to hold the federal
funds rate around zero through the end of 2022 and the discussion of the
potential yield control [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) at the FOMC June meeting deprive the
dollar of its important benefits. Yes, the Fed says it is too early to
suggest targeting bond yields, however, if the US growth continues to
recover and the bond market rates continue to rise, its [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) may
change.

Therefore, the current euro’s strength mostly results from the hope that
the ECB and the euro-area governments will protect the economy better
than their colleagues in other world regions. Advances in medicine and
the improvement of the epidemiological situation in Europe increases the
euro risk reversals. The premium for the euro buy [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) against safe-
haven assets such as the US dollar or Japanese yen is growing faster
than the price of sell [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/).

### Dynamics of the ratio of U.S. versus Germany confirmed COVID-19
cases and EUR/JPY risk reversals

Of course, the [EUR/USD][2] is greatly supported by the US stock
indexes. The best three-month rise of the US stock market over the past
two decades was one of the reasons for the euro rally in the May-June
period. Besides, Instinet notes that the last seven times the [S&P
500][5] __ rose 15% in a quarter, it rose an average of 9.5% in the next
quarter. Strong reading of the US jobs market should support the stock
market rise and encourage the euro fans to open longs at the breakout of
the resistance at $1.129 with the targets at $1.1335 and $1.139.
