Fed and Butterfly Effect. EURUSD forecast 16.12.2020Dmitri Demidenko

The Fed’s passive attitude doesn’t shake the financial market s as a
rule. However, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are so stressed that a single word by Jerome
Powell could result in a strong market move. Let us discuss the Forex
outlook and make up a [EURUSD][1] trading plan.

## Weekly US dollar fundamental forecast

When the financial market’s stress has reached its climax, even an
unimportant factor could quickly move it up or down. The rising gauge of
momentum inspires the US stocks bulls; bears note the extreme values of
positive sentiment, including the excessive call option volumes. The
Fed’s meeting could become the butterfly flapping its wings, which will
start a wave of purchases or sales all over the world. Much, if not
everything, depends on the [S&P 500][2] trend now. The [EURUSD][1] is
also very responsive to US stocks.

According to the US stock indexes, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s monitor the global risk
appetite, whose growth has seriously weakened the US dollar recently.
However, the US long-term economic outlook is bright, while the first
quarter will be rather weak, according to the experts polled by the Wall
Street Journal. Analysts expect the US GDP to go down to 1.9% in the
January-March period, followed by the growth rate rise to 4% in April-
June and July-September.

How can the Fed change [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s’ risk appetite? The majority of the
economists polled by Bloomberg expect the Fed to offer new guidance for
its $120-billion asset purchase program. The QE should continue for
several months as currently expected; however, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s want the
Federal Reserve to link the [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) with the inflation rate and
unemployment. If the Fed doesn’t meet the expectations, the [S&P 500][2]
will go down.

### Forecasts for changes in QE guidance

Nonetheless, the primary driver for the [S&P 500][2] moves, either up or
down, is the Fed’s projections for the federal funds rate. The latest
GDP forecasts suggest the US growth should contract by 3.7% in 2020 and
expand by 4% in 2021. The good [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) about vaccines gives [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s hope
that the projections will be revised up. But what will the Federal
Reserve do with the borrowing costs? The FOMC median gauge suggests that
the interest rate will be at a level of 0%-0.25% through at least the
end of 2023. If the FOMC officials hint at an earlier rate hike, it will
press the US stock market down and strengthen the US dollar.

### Weekly [EURUSD][1] trading plan

Nordea Markets expects that the Fed should start normalizing its
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) already in the first half of 2022 amid the quick rebound
of the US economy and the inflation growth. I don’t think such a
scenario is viable now. Jerome Powell and his fellow central bankers are
more likely to wait and see, leaving the door for further monetary
expansion open and sticking to the dovish tone. If so, the [S&P 500][2]
rally will continue, followed by the [EURUSD][1] rise towards 1.22 and
1.224. However, under the current conditions, it is risky to buy at
highs or sell amid the correction expectations. I would rather open long
positions on the corrections.
