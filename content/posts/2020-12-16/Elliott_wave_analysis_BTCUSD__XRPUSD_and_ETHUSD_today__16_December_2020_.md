Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 16.12.2020Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I suggest entry signals
to trade each cryptocurrency.

The ETHUSD and BTCUSD should be rising in the near future, next, the
prices will go down in the corrective sub-waves.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

 ****

The BTCUSD market is forming the bullish trend as a zigzag. Within this
zigzag of a larger degree, there is forming the C impulse, namely its
final leg, the sub-wave [5]. Wave [5] is an impulse, where the long
corrective wave (4) has completed. The market is now rising in the sub-
wave (5), which is half-complete. The market should be rising in the
impulse wave 3 to a level of 19952.32, which is the previous high made
by wave (3). Next, the market should go down a little in correction 4,
and, then, the price will be rising in the final wave 5.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 19395.75 TP 19952.32

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

 ****

In the bullish impulse wave C, there is developing the down corrective
wave [4] as a simple zigzag (a)-(b)-(c). This correction is about to
end, and so, the upward wave [5] should start forming soon. Therefore,
the Ripple price should be rising. The first upside target is level
0.524. One could enter long trades in the current situation.

### Trading plan for **[XRPUSD][2]** today:

Buy 0.447, TP 0.524

* * *

## Elliott wave Ethereum analysis

 ****

Ethereum continues following the suggested scenario. The market is
forming the final impulse wave [5] that is concluding the impulse C of a
larger degree. After the two small sub-waves 1 and 2 completed, the
market has started rising in impulse 3. There is likely to be forming
the final leg of the impulse. Wave 3 should soon end at a level of
around 604.72. Next, there should be forming the corrective wave 4, as
it is outlined in the chart.

### Trading plan for  **[ETHUSD][3] **today:

Buy 582.38, TP 604.72
