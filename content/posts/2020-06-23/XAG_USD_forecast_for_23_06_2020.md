Silver is outperforming goldDmitri Demidenko

## XAG/USD bulls are going ahead

If you asked me which Forex&Commodities asset is the most promising
investment, I would choose silver without hesitating. First, silver
traditionally follows the sector leader, gold, so, it has the same
growth drivers. Second, the main consumer of physical silver is the
industry. It suggests the [XAG/USD][1] falls faster during global
recessions, but the uptrend also recovers faster than the [XAU/USD][2]
during the rebound of global growth.

According to the Silver Institute, silver should save [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s from the
economic fallout of the pandemic. The organization says, in 2020, the
global physical silver demand in the industrial consumption will decline
from 510.9 million ounces to 475.4 million ounces, the consumption of
silver jewelry and silverware will be down from 201.3 million ounces to
187.5 million ounces. However, the demand for [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/) products will increase
from 81.7 million ounces to 120 million ounces.

In fact, the [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/) silver holdings are increasing much faster. Since the
[XAG/USD][1] price started growing up from the March low, according to
Commerzbank, the [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/) silver holdings increased by 4900 tons, which is
equivalent to two months of global mining. Differently put, 2/3 of
global silver production is consumed by [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/)s.

In my opinion, the silver industrial demand will be increasing faster
than the Silver Institute expects. Under the current conditions, it is
easier to return people to production than make them use restaurants and
hotels. The results of social distancing are still present. That is why
the manufacturing PMI is going up to the trend faster than the services
PMI. One of the best performers is China, which has been one of the
first to defeat the COVID-19 epidemic. The growth of China’s PMI gives a
clue on the [XAG/USD][1] future price trend.

A significant proportion of the industrial consumption in sliver demand
influences the trend of silver futures during the recession, followed by
the global economic recovery. The silver price was sliding down faster
than gold to the low of March 2020 and to the low of October 2008 during
the previous economic crisis. From the lows of 2008 to the record highs
of 2011, the [XAU/USD][2] increased by 165%, while the [XAG/USD][1] was
490%(!) up. Since mid-March, gold has been 21% up, while the silver
price has increased by 53%.

In addition to the economic recovery after the recession, silver is
supported by the growth drivers of gold. These are huge volumes of cheap
liquidity provided by the Fed and other central banks, ultra-low rates
of the global bond market, and the weakness of the world major
currencies, including the US dollar. Therefore, I could recommend buying
silver on the breakout of the resistance levels at $18.2 and $18.45. The
middle-term upside targets for silver purchases are $20 and $23 per
ounce. The major risks for this scenario are the second wave of the
coronavirus pandemic and the escalation of trade wars.
