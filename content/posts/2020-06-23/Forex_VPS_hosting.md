Forex VPS HostingAlex Rodiоnov

## What is VPS and how does it work?

I am sure many of you have considered buying or designing an Expert
Advisor to trade ([automated](https://www.fintechee.com/features/automated-forex-trading/) trading system), install it on a VPS, and
launch it trade for you. Sounds good, isn’t it?

Or, here is another example. You are engaged in trust management and you
have over five accounts to manage. It creates much of load on the
hardware, and there may problems with the Internet connection.

The solution is using data center facilities, Virtual Personal Servers,
which are always online, 24/7. You won’t have to keep numerous terminals
open on your desktop. You won’t have to worry about the resources of
your facilities or maintenance work in the network of you Internet
provider at night.

A VPS is designed to take the load and accessible to the trader at any
time. It is like a complete workplace that can be used only for trading,
for example, trading with EAs, managing multiple [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s’ accounts or
copying the trading signals from the trader who is in a different time
zone.

From this article, you will learn about [how to](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-trading-how-to/) install VPS to trade
forex.

###  **Way №1. VPS from the LiteForex Company**

### Characteristics of the service

LiteForex offers its clients a user-friendly and reliable VPS for Forex
trading. Continue reading and you will know in detail [how to](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-trading-how-to/) install,
configure and run it.

 **Advantages of LiteForex VPS:**

  1. The VPS server from LiteForex is based on the virtualization technique named Microsoft Hyper-V that uses a 64-bit hypervisor isolated from the main OS. What does it mean? It means that all the resources stated in the price plan will be available for the clients anytime regardless of the company server workload.          
  2. Uninterrupted operation mode 24/7.  Forex trading won’t depend on your Internet connection or power supply at home/in the office.     
  3. The qualified support team for 24 hours.     
  4. Close proximity of VPS to the major company’s servers guarantees a **minimum** delay in the execution of orders.     
  5. It is user-friendly. Funds are activated and written off for hosting directly via a personal profile on the company’s [website](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/website-for-forex-trading/). 

 **The drawback may be** the price which is higher than that of
competitors. It may seem that in comparison with other VPS hosting, the
performance/price ratio is not in favor of LiteForex.

BUT: bear in mind that the **minimum ping** and the VPS **location
closest** to the main broker’s servers can be provided **only by the
broker**. It is worth paying more. Besides, you can easily activate the
server directly in your personal profile.

 **Let us is what VPS configuration is offered by LiteForex:**

  * OS Microsoft Windows Server 2008
  * CPU     - 1100 MHz
  * RAM is 1024 Mb     
  * HDD space is 25 GB
  * Price     is 15$ per month

This offer will suit ordinary traders who want to launch a couple of
trading [robot](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/automated-forex-trading-robot/)s on a 24-hour basis and a separate terminal without being
overloaded by a huge number of charts and EAs. At the background, you
can run a browser with economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) and analytics, or you may open
the chart of your trading instrument on some other resources. There will
be enough space on the HDD for all major tasks.

### Setup and installation

Having learnt about advantages and disadvantages and made your choice to
install the VPS from LiteForex, we shall deal with practical aspects:

  1. Go to the official LiteForex [website](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/website-for-forex-trading/) and open your trader profile.
  2. Log in using your login and password.
  3. Click on the **Trade tab** and then on the **MetaTrader icon**.

![LiteForex: Forex VPS hosting][1]

  1. Click on the **BUY VPS button in the next window**

![LiteForex: Forex VPS hosting][2]

  2. Check if have enough money on they account, the VPS cost model and click on **BUY FOR USD** the button.

![LiteForex: Forex VPS hosting][3]

_A brief remark: you can buy VPS for points that the broker accrues for
trading, namely, for the volume traded. If you have been cooperating
with a company for a long time or trading in large lots, you can use
this method of renting a server._

  3. When you click on the button, the application for the VPS goes into the     status of "in process". We are now waiting when the broker allocates a server for trading.

![LiteForex: Forex VPS hosting][4]

  4. After     some time, you will receive an email from     the broker with the details of the VPS server: IP address, login, password. The letter will confirm that your application has been approved.
  5. Next, I recommend using the standard Windows application - “Remote Desktop Connection”. You can find it through the "Search" tool, or you enter the "Start" menu and click on the "Standard" tab.
  6. Click on the "Show Options" button in the window that opens.

![LiteForex: Forex VPS hosting][5]

Enter the IP address of the server from the letter in the “Computer”
line, enter the login in the “User” line. Check the “Allow me to save
credentials” box. Click on the “Connect” button.

![LiteForex: Forex VPS hosting][6]

  7. You enter the password in the next window. It is also in the letter with the details from LiteForex. Click the “OK” button.

![LiteForex: Forex VPS hosting][7]

  8. If there is a warning message about the authenticity of the certificate, check the box “Do not display a request again ” and click on “Yes”.

![LiteForex: Forex VPS hosting][8]

  9. Next, there opens the VPS system window. The window displays the familiar     Windows desktop, which you need to configure for yourself.

You should do the following:

  * Download the LiteForex terminal and install it;
  * Import profiles from you desktop to the remote server using cloud, or custom the charts from the beginning
  * If you want, you can install additional software
  * And leave the system to work

Following all these steps, you get access to your “remote workstation”,
which will be active around the clock, 24/7. Now, if you close the
remote desktop, then all programs running there will work as usual. Your
MetaTrader terminals, EAs, indicators, other software will be available
to you at any time and anywhere where there is Internet access.

Enjoy the minimum delay to the server and your system working 24 hours a
day!

###  **Way №2. Virtual Hosting integrated in MetaTrader trading
platform**

### Service description

In this section, I will deal with the service you all are familiar with,
its [MQL5][10]. This is the company that designed trading terminals
MetaTrader 4 and MetaTrader 5.

To buy a VSP service, you need to visit the MQL5 official [website](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/website-for-forex-trading/). Next
you enter the VPS section. You can also right away go to the page
www.mql5.com/en/vps

There will be the service description on the page that opens, and you
can choose “a server with the lowest ping and the best execution”

 **Let us see the advantages of this way:**

  1. The price is $10 per month. The more months you rent a server, the cheaper it will be the monthly cost. The discount can be up to 21%

![LiteForex: Forex VPS hosting][11]

  2. The first 24 hours are free for all new users. It is excellent! You can test the service, and, if you do not like it, you can cancel your subscription. Read on to learn [how to](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-trading-how-to/) set he free service plan

![LiteForex: Forex VPS hosting][12]

  3. You can order a VPS directly in your MetaTrader terminal and set the data migration mode immediately. 
  4. You can synchronize:

A) experts, indicators and signal;

B) experts and indicators;

C) signal only.

  5. You can manage the resources. The platform has up to 16GB HDD, up to 3     GB RAM, multiple physical CPU cores. It is not specified how many CPU cores there are, but the company claims they easily cover the needs of multiple [trading strategies](https://www.fintechee.com/forex-trading-strategies/) run simultaneously.
  6. The activation of the apps bought in the [Market][13] is not canceled 

 **There are also some drawbacks:**

  1. It won’t suit if you use other terminals (not MetaTrader)
  2. It is designed only for trading. You can’t run other apps or software, you can’t access the Remote Operating System.
  3. One rented terminal works only with one trading account.
  4. You can’t launch indicators and experts using any DLL in the virtual terminal. There is no physical opportunity to use DLL.

### How to launch a VPS in your terminal

A paid subscription is activated just in the same way as a trial free
plan. Therefore, let us see how you install the server on the example of
the **limited trial period.**

 **Important! You must have a registered account in the MQL5 community.
If you do not have any, you need to register one before you can activate
VPS.**

  1. Open your MT4 terminal.
  2. Open settings menu (CTRL+O).
  3. Go to the “Community” tab and enter your login and password for     MQL5. Click on the “OK” button. You can skip this step if you have already logged in your terminal.

![LiteForex: Forex VPS hosting][14]

  4. Open the “Navigator menu” (the key combination CTRL+N)
  5. In the list of your trading accounts, choose the account that you want place on the virtual server and right-click on it.
  6. Click on the “Register Virtual Server”.

![LiteForex: Forex VPS hosting][15]

  7. Choose the tariff plan in the virtual hosting wizard window. I recommend selecting the Free trial period to test the service.
  8. Select the “Free” option and click on the “Next” button.

![LiteForex: Forex VPS hosting][16]

  9. Agree to the virtual hosting service rules. You may leave or turn off  “Automatically renew subscription with sufficient funds and     terminal activity”. Click on the “Next” button.

![LiteForex: Forex VPS hosting][17]

  10. Congratulations! You have run the VPS for your terminal. Now, you need to choose the data migration mode: indicators and [robot](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/automated-forex-trading-robot/)s, signals or all, according to the tasks that you set for the VPS.

![LiteForex: Forex VPS hosting][18]

You can also set the option **“migrate later”** if you haven’t finished
setting your terminal.

After clicking on the button “finish” the wizard window will close.

If everything is successful, you will see the following lines in the
“Journal”.

![LiteForex: Forex VPS hosting][19]

 **Note that after each change of parameters synchronized in your
terminal, you need to synchronize the surroundings with the VPS
manually.**

You can do it by right clicking on you trading account and choosing the
needed synchronization parameters. You can stop server to cancel hosting
in the same menu.

![LiteForex: Forex VPS hosting][20]

As you see, everything is quite easy. All the operations are made in
your trading terminal MetaTrader 4/5. If you activate the free
subscription, do not forget to top up the MQL5 before you renew the
subscription or change the tariff plan.
