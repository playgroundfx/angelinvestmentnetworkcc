Commodity Market analysis: Oil forecastMikhail Hypov

##  **S &P GSCI and Crude Oil WTI: Technical analysis of oil market.
Candlestick analysis and fractal analysis. Wave structure analysis.**

My previous article reviewed the commodity market and [S&P Goldman Sachs
Commodity Index][1] in particular. Today, I’ll proceed with the analysis
of commodity groups. In the first place, I’ll analyse [oil][2] and
[gold][3]. These commodity groups have some peculiarities.

![LiteForex: Commodity Market review: Actual scenario and oil
forecast][4]

The dynamics of their long-term cost growth yields to [S&P500][5], for
example (check the chart above). Thus, the composition of participants
in these markets is somewhat different. There is no point in holding
[gold][3] and [oil][6], or any other commodities, in the long term.
That’s why the share of institutional [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s here is much smaller
than in the stock market. The main market participants are speculators,
commodity brokers and large industrial holding companies. [Gold][3]
stands out, though. It is often used as a protective asset. During a
crisis, private [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s grow more interested in this metal, which
covers the industrial sector’s falling demand.

![LiteForex: Commodity Market review: Actual scenario and oil
forecast][7]

I have highlighted 2 crisis events in the chart above: the year 2008 and
the current crisis. Comparing the dynamics of those periods, we see that
[gold][3] remains at the same levels or even slightly grows while the
stock market falls. Despite the stocks’ global leadership as an
investment tool, gold may be more attractive in the short term.

Why? Because [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s tend to avoid risks. Gold’s higher growth
dynamics means that the [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s don’t feel confident about the stock
market and diversify their portfolios to minimize risks. This behaviour
pattern is a good indicator for macroeconomic analysis of the stock
market.

![LiteForex: Commodity Market review: Actual scenario and oil
forecast][8]

Let me make a small digression here. Compare the Bitcoin chart with
[SPX][5], [GOLD ][9]and [OIL][6]. As you see, other assets show almost
no growth, except gold. So, if you are a portfolio [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/), think about
holding a small % of your capital in cryptocurrency.

 **Technical analysis of oil**

![LiteForex: Commodity Market review: Actual scenario and oil
forecast][10]

First, let’s update the [oil][6] forecast I made in [March][11]. In the
chart above, oil correlates with the commodity index. We can use this
fact in technical analysis in order to filter market noise related to
high volatility and see the picture more clearly.

 **Long-term scenario**

![LiteForex: Commodity Market review: Actual scenario and oil
forecast][12]

The 12-month time frame of [WTI Oil][6] is displayed in the chart above.
Three key levels are seen here:

\- the buyers’ level at 12.26 in 1999 when the strongest bullish wave
began

\-  the second level at 46.81. Another level of buyers who opened trades
after the 2008 crisis

\-  the third level is the sellers’ level at 100 USD per barrel. It was
impossible to consolidate above it.

A long shadow is forming below the ultimate candlestick. It pulled back
from the first level of 12.26 USD. According to the Japanese
candlesticks, a “hammer” may be forming, but it is too early to speak
about it now because there’s a shadow above and the body is big enough.
A strong bullish signal will have been produced before the end of 2020
if the price has consolidated above 46.81 USD. In the long term, the
bearish trend will continue. The pattern including a pullback like after
2008 may be repeated in the opposite direction (marked with the red
arrow). This scenario will be confirmed if the [oil][6] price hasn’t
consolidated above 46.81 USD by the end of the year.

![LiteForex: Commodity Market review: Actual scenario and oil
forecast][13]

The chart above displays the GSCI commodity index which shows the same
picture as the chart of [Crude Oil WTI][6] does. The exception is that
the minimum didn’t test the support level at 169 points after the last
fall. It means the bearish [oil][6] breakout was false. It’s a good
example of how the GSCI filter works when applied to the oil market. Now
we can say with more confidence that this level won’t be retested in the
next few years.

 **Medium-term forecast**

![LiteForex: Commodity Market review: Actual scenario and oil
forecast][14]

On the 1-month time frame above, the wave pattern remained unchanged as
compared with March’s [oil forecast ][11]. The pattern forming now
corresponds well to the global scenario marked with the red arrow.
According to this scenario, the price may go outside the limits of 46
USD per barrel in the short term. Then, it will proceed to fall to 20
USD per WTI barrel.

 **Short-term forecast for WTI oil price**

![LiteForex: Commodity Market review: Actual scenario and oil
forecast][15]

Have a look at the WTI weekly chart above. For sure, wave (a) in zigzag
Y of the WXYXZ pattern is completed (the orange pattern inside the
purple pattern). We see wave (A) nearing completion in the blue zigzag
of wave (b) at the moment. We can’t say yet that wave (A) has fully
formed, but obviously it has no further growth reserves because it’s
located near powerful resistance levels:

  1. Traded area at 51 - 65 USD (blue oval);
  2. Extremum of zigzag of wave (a) at  42.33 - 47 USD (red circle);
  3. Global buyer level at 46.81 USD (green line);
  4.  0.5 fibo of wave (a) at 43.39 USD.

This cluster of resistance levels allows supposing that a future
extremum and a bearish reversal will be at around 43-46 USD.

 **Trading plan for the next few weeks**

![LiteForex: Commodity Market review: Actual scenario and oil
forecast][16]

Prioritize short positions at 46 USD. A bearish signal should be
confirmed by an indicator or a candlestick pattern.

Stop Loss is placed beyond 0.618 fibo of wave (a) at around 53 USD.

Target: a bearish correction at around 0.5 fibo of the last wave, 28 USD
approximately.

Risk/Profit ratio: 2.8, which is almost a perfect value in the classic
risk management system. Remember to set correct leverage and lot values.
Observe your risk and money management rules.

Remember that you can open a short trade in [WTI][6] with a low
commission at LiteForex. If you aren’t a trader, it’s time to start
