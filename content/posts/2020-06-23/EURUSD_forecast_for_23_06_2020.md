Dollar: the devil is in the detailsDmitri Demidenko

## The White House doesn’t plan a deep correction of the S&P 500

The business won’t go on well without the agreement among the
businessmen. White House trade [advisor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/expert-advisor/) Peter Navarro said the US trade
deal with China is “over”, which has shaken financial markets. The S&P
500 has been down, which is not what the US administration wanted. Both
the trade [advisor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/expert-advisor/), who said his words were taken out of context, and
Donald Trump had to make excuses. The US President tweeted that the
China trade deal is fully intact. It seems to be a minor episode, but
the devil is always in the details. Trump will do his best to avert the
crash of the US stock indexes, and so, the [EUR/USD][1] bulls could go
ahead.

The second wave of the pandemic and the escalation of the trade war are
the factors that can weigh on the S&P 500. Despite the record number of
coronavirus cases in some US states and the world, serious problems
because of the coronavirus in Basil, financial markets still hope for a
soon victory over the pandemic. The [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) about coronavirus vaccine and
cure gives the global stock market optimism. As for trade wars, Robert
Lighthizer said the parties are willing to meet their obligations under
the agreement on time. Furthermore, Beijing is willing to increase
purchases of US agricultural products and to fulfill its promise to buy
an additional $200 billion in American goods and services over the next
two years. This should have reassured [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s. However, one wrong
phrase by Peter Navarro has caused much stress.

Remarkably, China didn’t feature a lively response to Trump’s attacks,
including the threats to break all the relations. According to the US
former national security adviser John Bolton, Beijing wants Trump to be
re-elected as the US president. Why should China want this? Trump
threatens with new tariffs and blames China for the coronavirus
pandemic. This may be because Trump does more harm to the USA than to
China. By the way, China’s economy, according to Bloomberg’s experts,
will avert the recession and should be growing faster than it was
earlier expected. China’s GDP should be up by 1.5% in the second quarter
and by 1.8% in 2020. In May, it was expected to be 1.2% and 1.7%.

Good [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) from China should support the export-led economy of euro-area,
as well as the euro. Moreover, the ECB is not willing to openly confront
Germany’s Constitutional Court, which required the €2.5 trillion QE to
be justified by an independent organization. According to Christine
Lagarde, the European central bank does this at each meeting.

The [EUR/USD][1] bulls expect that the minutes of the June meeting of
the Governing Council should express a more conciliatory position.
Remember, the ECB decided to boost the QE size by €600 billion at the
last meeting. The euro will also be supported by a strong reading of the
euro-area PMI. According to Bloomberg forecasts, both the manufacturing
PMI and services PMI should continue growing after reaching the low in
April. Strong PMI data could push the euro up to the resistance at
$1.1280-$1.1285.
