Forex economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/)Oleg Tkachenko

## What is the forex [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) and [how to](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-trading-how-to/) use it to make profits?
Major fundamental events that influence foreign exchange rates. Examples
of [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) trading based on the economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/).

[The economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/)][1] is the main tool used in fundamental
analysis. This is the list of major forex economic events that can
influence foreign exchange rates. Read on about the important economic
events that traders track, how they influence foreign exchange rates,
and how you can make money trading the [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/).

### Ways to use the economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) to trade forex

Fundamental analysis suggests [Forex trading](https://www.fintechee.com/forex-trading-strategies/) based on economic data
releases. Macroeconomic and sectoral statistics, economic indicators,
central banks’ statements, other economic reports are the factors that
can radically change the market sentiment, and so, it influences the
forex rates, commodities or securities. Traders like fundamental
analysis and the forex fundamental announcements [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) because it,
unlike technical analysis, doesn’t require deep knowledge of technical
indicators. So, [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) trading is suitable for all [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s. The major
tool of “fundamental” trader is the economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/), whose strong
sides are covered [in this review][2].

 **Practical application of FX economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/)**

The economic fx [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) is the list of upcoming events ([calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) of
events) grouped by countries, importance (the strongest impact on forex
rates), and so on. An event, scheduled in the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/),
which  going on in a country directly influences its local currency and
market conditions.

 **The most important events in the USA that affect the value of
assets:**

  *  **Fed’s decision on the federal funds rate changes** (frequency: 1-3 times a year). It influences [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s’ interest in the US currency. An interest rate hike results in the growth of the USD value relative to other currencies.
  *  **Nonfarm payrolls** (monthly US jobs report). You can learn how this report affects foreign exchange rates and [how to](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-trading-how-to/) make money using nonfarm payrolls [here][3].               
  *  **Reports on crude oil production and the number of oil rigs** (published monthly). They have a short-term effect on oil futures. If oil production declines, the demand usually increases. If the number of operating oil rigs contracts, the supply will reduce. In both cases, oil prices increase.

 **Other important events that influence Forex rates:**

  *  **ECB’s monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) decisions.** It determines the future [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) concerning inflation, issuance of bonds, volumes of money supply, interest, and deposit rates.
  *  **Macroeconomic statistics.** It covers the balance of payments, GDP rate and industrial production, inflation rate, price indexes, and other economic data. It affects the value of the local currency versus the US dollar.

The above examples are only a part of the cases that represent the
relation of the forex rates to the wide range of economic events.

 **Example of a forex [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) trading strategy. Make money on the forex
market when BoE Governor Carney speaks**

Select the current date (for, example, 09.01.2020) in the [economic
[calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/)][1] and enter the event importance (choose the high priority).
On the given date, there are only two events of high priority: the
governors of the BoE and the BoC speak. Select your time zone in the fx
forex [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) (for example, for GMT+2, the speech starts at 11.30 local
time).

Let’s try to make profits from the first event, the speech of the BoE
governor Mark Carney. Open the GBP/USD trading chart and analyze the
hourly chart in real time.

Over the past 10 days, the price chart has formed a Triangle pattern.
This means that the price can break out the upper or the lower border of
the pattern at any time. The BoE governor’s speech is likely to trigger
the breakout (filter all the important [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) for the current week in the
UK filter, and you will see that, apart from this speech, there no more
[news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) events particularly significant).

Set the M5 timeframe for the [GBP/USD][6] pair on MT4. And wait until
11.30. As a risk warning, I’d like to note that it carries a high level
of risk to enter a trade during the first minute, as the majority’s
opinion has not yet formed and the initial direction can be false. Hold
the position open for about 30 minutes (the price can work out some most
important events in a few hours), but, if the trend is exhausting
(smaller candlestick bodies, candlestick in the opposite direction),
exit the trade earlier.

Mark Carney has signaled that the Bank of England is willing to lower
the interest rate from 0.75% to 0.5% if the weakness of the UK economy
continues, gave a general market commentary. This has strengthened the
pound against the US dollar allowing it to hit its two-week low. One
could have earned about 40 points on this new over 30 minutes.

Note that you don’t have to listen to the speech of the Bank of England
governor (although it is useful). It is enough to follow the trend, that
is the opinion of the majority. However, there is a risk to enter a
little late. So, I still recommend reading the [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) or listening to
direct speech, to pick up the start of the new trend early and start
trading.

 **A few tips to traders trading based on the fundamental analysis:**

  * You should always compare the current data with the forecast. If the report is positive but worse than the forecast, the asset price will go down.
  * Be careful with the filters. If you choose only the USA in the filter, you can miss the data on the euro-area economy. And it can make a strong influence on the market.
  * You should fully understand the potential impact of the [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/). Bear in mind that if the event is expected and predictable, the price may not change when the event occurs, as it has been already priced. For example, a relatively predictable change in the Fed’s interest rate will have a little impact on the U.S. dollar rate at the moment of the decision.
