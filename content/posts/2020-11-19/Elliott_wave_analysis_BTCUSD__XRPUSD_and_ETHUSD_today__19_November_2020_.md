Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 19.11.2020Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I suggest entry signals
to trade each cryptocurrency.

The Ripple price chart has finished forming the triangle correction [4].
The XRPUSD market is rising in the impulse wave [5]. The price growth
should end at level 0.310.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

 ****

The BTCUSD price chart displays the impulse wave C that is composed of
five sub-waves [1]-[2]-[3]-[4]-[5]. Within the C wave, there is forming
the bullish impulse wave [5] as a simple impulse (1)-(2)-(3)-(4)-(5).
The first four parts of the impulse look complete. There is forming wave
(5) with four parts out of five completed within. The market should be
rising in the final wave 5 to a level of 19200.00.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Buy 17785.50, TP 19200.00

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

 ****

The XRPUSD market is developing the bullish corrective wave (B) as a
simple zigzag A-B-C. The impulse wave A and the bearish correction B,
which is a triple zigzag, have completed. There is now forming the final
wave C as an impulse. There must be unfolding the final wave [5], namely
its final leg, the sub-wave 5 of (5). The Ripple price should be rising
to a level of 0.310.

### Trading plan for **[XRPUSD][2]** today:

Buy 0.292, TP 0.310

* * *

##  **Elliott wave Ethereum analysis**

 ****

The ETHUSD market is forming the final wave in the bullish zigzag of a
larger degree. The C wave is unfolding as a simple impulse
[1]-[2]-[3]-[4]-[5]. There is now forming the final upward wave (5) of
[5], which is also an impulse. Wave (5) has completed four legs,
1-2-3-4, out of five. The price should be rising in wave 5 towards a
level of 507.00.

### Trading plan for  **[ETHUSD][3] **today:

Buy 478.74, TP 507.00
