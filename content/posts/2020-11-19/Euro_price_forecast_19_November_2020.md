Euro chose the path. Forecast as of 19.11.2020Dmitri Demidenko

The correction of the US stock indexes is dangerous for the EURUSD
bulls. However, the recovery of the global economy promises euro buyers
good profits. Let us discuss the Forex outlook and make up a [EURUSD][1]
trading plan.

##  **Monthly** **euro fundamental forecast**

What is your trading style? Will you sell an asset in the short-term,
being ready to take the profit at any time if you see a correction in
the uptrend? Or will you buy and hold the longs expecting the drawdown
to end? If you answer this question, you will know [how to](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-trading-how-to/) trade the
[EURUSD][1]. Effective vaccines will support global economic growth in
2021. However, the markets should remain unstable in the short-term.
There is a strong demand for safe-haven assets, including the US dollar.
But [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s should sell them sooner or later.

Although vaccinations will take time, and the logistical challenges are
enormous, the global economy will be stronger in a year or two than it
is now. The US stock market could be overvalued now, reacting to the
positive [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) about vaccines developed by Pfizer and Moderna.
Nevertheless, the long-term outlook for the US stock indices is
optimistic. The [EURUSD][1] long-term prospects are also positive.
Coronavirus vaccines are not the only growth driver for the euro.

Donald Trump’s protectionism, political uncertainty in the USA, and an
11% drop of the USD from the March high resulted in the fact that the
single European currency for the first time over many years has
outperformed the greenback in the international settlements. Yes, the US
dollar is the primary funding currency, it is the major currency in the
conversion transactions and FX reserves of the world’s central banks,
but this won’t hinder the [EURUSD][1] rally. It is enough that the
central banks diversify the FX reserves in favor of the euro.

The victory over the coronavirus pandemic is not the only factor that
can accelerate economic expansion. According to the WTO research, in
2020, the G20 countries have introduced 133 trade measures related to
COVID-19. 84 of them were aimed at facilitating trade, 49 - to restrict
it. The entire world expects the USA and China to lower the import
tariffs. Based on Xi Jinping's statement, Beijing is willing to do it.

Therefore, the euro's long-term outlook is clearly bullish. However, the
[EURUSD][1] bears can well develop a short-term correction down. The
main reason for this is the [S&P 500][2] drawdown. BofA Merrill Lynch
notes that the share of cash in global [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s' portfolios has
approached the critical 4% mark, which usually serves as a signal for
selling US stocks.

### Monthly [EURUSD][1] trading plan

Therefore, position traders should enter the [EURUSD][1] long-term longs
on the corrections down to 1.18, 1.176,  1.172, and 1.167. Speculators
could sell the euro in the short-term with narrow targets.
