Economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the week 26.10.2020 – 01.11.2020Jana Kane

##  **Review of the main events of the Forex economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the
next trading week (26.10.2020 – 01.11.2020)**

 **Trading on key Forex [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/): next week we are expecting the publication
of important macro statistics from Australia, the Eurozone, Germany, the
United States, as well as the results of the meetings of the central
banks of Canada, Japan, and the Eurozone.**

The dollar fell last week. American stock indices also lost a little
ground. The DXY dollar index was down about 0.9%, mainly due to the
weakening of the dollar against the euro, pound and yen, whose share in
the DXY index is about 57%, 12%, and 14%, respectively.

The euro and pound remain under pressure from a sharp increase in the
number of coronavirus cases in Europe and the UK, which could result in
new tough quarantine measures that restrict economic activity. The pound
is also affected by the Brexit situation, and the representatives of the
EU and the UK have not yet managed to make progress on the trade deal.

However, the dollar and US stock indices are also under pressure from
the uncertainty of the outcome of the upcoming US presidential election.

The focus of [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s next week will be on the publication of important
macro data from Australia, the Eurozone, Germany, the United States, as
well as the meetings of the central banks of Canada, Japan, and the
Eurozone.

On the night of October 24-25, European countries switch to winter
daylight saving time. In the United States, the clock will be set back 1
hour on November 1.

 **Traders should pay attention to the publication of the following
macro indicators:**

 ***during the coming week, new events may be added to the [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) and
/ or some scheduled events may be canceled**

 ****** **GMT time**

###  **Monday, October 26**

###  **00:30 AUD Balance of trade**

This indicator measures the ratio of Australia's export and import
volumes. Growth in exports from Australia leads to an increase in the
trade surplus, which has a positive impact on the AUD. The previous
value (August) was AU$ 2.643 billion. A decrease in the trade surplus
may negatively affect the Australian dollar.

###  **Tuesday, October 27**

###  **09:00 EUR Eurozone Bank Lending Survey**

This survey of the state of the bank lending system is carried out by EU
financial experts 4 times a year. The main goal of the survey is to
obtain expanded information on the conditions of bank lending in the
Eurozone. The obtained data are used by the ECB leaders when making
decisions on the bank's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). This report may cause increased
volatility in the euro quotes and on the European stock market at the
time of its publication if it contains unexpected conclusions regarding
the [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of lending to businesses and households in the Eurozone.

###  **12:30 USD Durable goods orders. Capital goods orders (ex defense
and aviation)**

This indicator reflects the value of orders received by manufacturers of
durable goods and capital goods (capital goods are durable commodities
used to produce durable goods and services), involving large
investments. Commodities produced in the defense and aviation sectors of
the US economy are not included in this indicator. A strong result
strengthens the USD. Previous values ​​of the indicator "durable goods
orders": +0.5% in August, +11.7% in July, +7.7% in June, +15.0% in May,
-18.3% in April , -16.7% in March, +2.0% in February, -0.2% in January.

Previous values ​​of the indicator "capital goods orders ex defense and
aviation": +1.9% in August, +2.5% in July, +4.3% in June, +1.5% in May,
-6, 6% in April, -1.3% in March, -0.6% in February, +0.9% in January.

In theory, the relative growth of the indicator has a positive effect on
the dollar; the market reaction to its negative value may be negative
for the dollar in the short term. Data worse than the previous value
will also negatively affect the dollar quotes.

Forecast for September: +0.7 % (durable goods orders), +0.5% (capital
goods ordersex defense and aviation).

It looks like the indicators are declining again after their recovery in
previous months from a strong fall in March and April, which may
negatively affect the dollar quotes. The slightly better-than-expected
data is also unlikely to have a long-term positive impact on the dollar.

###  **Wednesday, October 28 Октября**

###  **01:30 AUD RBA trimmed mean core inflation index (for the 3rd
quarter). Consumer Price Index (Q3)**

This indicator is published by the RBA and the Australian Bureau of
Statistics. It reflects the dynamics of retail prices of goods and
services included in the consumer basket. The trimmed mean method takes
into account the weighted average kernel, the central 70% of the index
components. Previous index values: -0.1% (+1.2% YoY) in Q2, +0.5% (+1.8%
YoY) in Q1 2020, +0.4% (+1.6% YoY) in Q4, Q3 and Q2 2019. According to
the forecast, it is expected that the value of the indicator for the 3rd
quarter of 2020 will be +0.1% (+1.4% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)). If the value of
the indicator coincides with the forecast or turns out to be worse than
it, it is likely to negatively affect the AUD. The data indicate low
inflationary pressures in the country. The growth of the indicator
should have a positive effect on the AUD in the short term.

The Consumer Price Inflation Index (CPI) published by the RBA and the
Australian Bureau of Statistics measures the dynamics of retail prices
for goods and services in Australia. CPI is the most significant
indicator of inflation and changes in consumer preferences. A high value
is positive for the AUD, while a low reading is negative. Previous
values ​​of the indicator: -1.9% (-0.3% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) in the 2nd
quarter, +0.3% (+2.2% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) in the 1st quarter of 2020, +0.7%
(+1.8% YoY) in Q4, +0.5% (+1.7% YoY) in Q3 2019. According to the
forecast, it is expected that the value of the indicator for the 3rd
quarter of 2020 will be at -1.6%. A negative reading is likely to
negatively affect the AUD in the short term. If the value of the
indicator turns out to be worse than the forecast, it will affect the
AUD even more negatively.

###  **14:00 CAD Bank of Canada's decision on interest rate. Bank of
Canada's accompanying statement**

The Bank of Canada will decide on the interest rate. In March, the bank
lowered the rate 3 times to the level of 0.25% to mitigate the economic
damage from the novel coronavirus pandemic.

In the accompanying statement, the central bank of Canada said that the
decision "aims to support the financial system, which plays a central
role in lending to the economy, as well as to create a foundation that
will allow the economy to return to normal." The central bank also said
in a press release that the spread of the coronavirus and the plummeting
global oil prices combined are weighing heavily on Canadians and the
Canadian economy.

In fact, quantitative easing and a significant cut in the interest rate
should contribute to the weakening of the national currency.

The impact of the coronavirus on the Canadian economy and the country's
labor market (unemployment rose to 7.8% in March from 5.6% in February,
while the number of employed fell by 1.01 million people, Statistics
Canada said), as well as weak housing market put pressure on the Bank of
Canada towards further easing of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).

However, the Bank of Canada is expected to keep its interest rate at
0.25% at the meeting on Wednesday.

Tough tone of the accompanying statement by the Bank of Canada on rising
inflation and the prospects for further tightening of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
will cause the Canadian dollar to strengthen. If the Bank of Canada
signals the need for a soft monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), the Canadian currency will
decline.

###  **15:15 CAD Bank of Canada's press conference**

During the press conference, the head of the Bank of Canada Tiff Macklem
will explain the bank's position and assess the current economic
situation in the country. If the tone of his speech is tough on the
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the Bank of Canada, the Canadian dollar will
strengthen in the foreign exchange market. If Tiff Maclem speaks out for
maintaining a soft monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), the Canadian currency will decline.
In any case, during his speech, high volatility is expected in the CAD
quotes.

###  **Thurday, October 29**

###  **03:00 JPY Bank of Japan's decision on interest rate. Bank of
Japan's press conference and comments on monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)**

The Bank of Japan will decide on the interest rate. At the moment, the
interest rate in Japan is in negative territory, amounting to -0.1%.
Most likely, the rate will remain the same. If it is cut and deepens
into negative territory, such a decision will cause a sharp decline in
the yen on the foreign exchange market and an increase in the Japanese
stock market. In any case, during this period of time, a jump in
volatility is expected in trading in the yen and in the Asian financial
market.

Since February 2016, the Bank of Japan has kept the deposit rate at
-0.1%. The target yield for 10-year bonds is currently around 0%. In
2020, the Bank of Japan set an annual target for [ETF](https://www.fixpro.org/post/etf-liquidity/) purchases at 12
trillion yen and expanded its virus-affected business aid program to 110
trillion yen from 75 trillion yen. Under this program, companies can
obtain loans without collateral and at a zero interest rate. The goal of
the program is to support commercial companies whose bankruptcy rates
have skyrocketed in Japan in recent months, including due to the
coronavirus pandemic. The recent accompanying statement from the Bank of
Japan said that the bank's management will continue to "increase the
monetary base until inflation stays above 2%." “We will not hesitate to
take additional mitigation measures if necessary,” the bank also
traditionally said in a statement.

During the press conference, the head of the Bank of Japan Haruhiko
Kuroda will comment on the bank's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). The Bank of Japan
continues to adhere to its super-soft monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). As Kuroda has
stated on several occasions, "it is appropriate for Japan to patiently
continue with its current loose monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)." Markets usually react
actively to Kuroda's speeches. He will probably touch upon the topic of
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) in his speech, which will cause an increase in
volatility not only in trading in the yen, but also throughout the Asian
and world financial markets.

If the bank's management decides that the Japanese economy is stable and
the momentum of inflation towards the 2% target is not diminishing, they
will refrain from changing [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).

###  **06:00 JPY Bank of Japan's press conference**

During the press conference, the head of the Bank of Japan Haruhiko
Kuroda will comment on the bank's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). Despite the bank's
earlier measures to stimulate the Japanese economy, inflation remains
low, production and consumption are falling, which negatively affects
export-oriented Japanese manufacturers. Markets usually react actively
to Kuroda's speeches. If he touches on the topic of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) in
his speech, volatility will increase not only in trading in the yen, but
throughout the Asian and global financial markets.

###  **12:30 USD US Annual GDP for 3rd Quarter (preliminary release)**

GDP data is one of the key indicators (along with labor market and
inflation data) for the Fed in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of its monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). Strong
result strengthens US dollar; weak GDP report negatively affects the US
dollar. In the previous 2nd quarter, GDP declined by -31.4%, after
growing by 2.1% in the 3rd and 4th quarters of 2019.

If the data points to another strong decline in GDP in the 3rd quarter,
the dollar will be under pressure. Positive data on GDP will support the
dollar and US stock indices.

###  **12:45 EUR ECB's decision on rates**

The ECB will publish its decision on the key rate and deposit rate. The
ECB's tough stance on inflation and key interest rates contributes to
the strengthening of the euro, while the soft stance and rate cuts
weaken the euro. In September 2019, the European Central Bank lowered
its key interest rate on deposits by 0.1%, to -0.5% and began buying
bonds worth 20 billion euros a month, renewing the so-called
quantitative easing program.

In a follow-up press conference, former European Central Bank President
Mario Draghi said the balance of risks to the Eurozone's economic
outlook "remains negatively tilted," implying the possibility of
additional stimulus if needed.

The ECB rate cut in September was the first since March 2016, and “until
inflation is in line” with the target, which is just below 2%, the rate
will remain low. Now inflation in the Eurozone is stubbornly holding
around 1%, and the new forecasts of the ECB on rates and the QE program
can be seen as a signal of the inclination to further soften [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).

After Brexit, escalating trade conflicts and political instability in
the Eurozone are the main threats to the European economy.

Speaking earlier in the European Parliament, Christine Lagarde, who
became the new president of the European Central Bank in November, said
that the ECB's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) stimulus continues to have a beneficial
effect on the Eurozone economy. “I agree with the ECB Governing
Council's view that a stimulating monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) will remain
appropriate over a long period of time,” Lagarde said.

An additional factor that may put pressure on the ECB to further ease
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) is the coronavirus. Back in March, the ECB signaled the
possibility of [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) easing, and the bank's representative admitted
that the bank's management could lower the already negative interest
rates even more.

Probably, following the results of this ECB meeting, the key interest
rate will remain at the same level of 0%. The ECB's rate on deposits for
commercial banks is also likely to remain at -0.5%. At the same time, it
is highly likely that at this meeting the ECB will announce a new
program to stimulate the economy.

###  **13:00 EUR Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices  (HICP) in Germany
(preliminary release)**

This index is published by the EU Statistics Office and is calculated on
the basis of a statistical method agreed upon between all EU countries.
It is an indicator for assessing inflation and is used by the Governing
Council of the ECB to assess the level of price stability. A positive
result strengthens the EUR, a negative one weakens it.

In May, the HICP index (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) increased by +0.5%, in June by
+0.8%, in July - by 0%, in September it decreased by -0.4%. Preliminary
forecast for October: -0.2%. The euro is likely to react negatively to
the publication of this indicator. If the data turn out to be better
than the forecast, the euro may strengthen in the short term. The growth
of the indicator is a positive factor for the euro. The data indicate
that inflationary pressures are still low in Germany. The data worse
than the forecast and the previous value will negatively affect the
euro.

###  **13:30 EUR Press conference of the ECB**

During the press conference, a surge in volatility is possible not only
in the euro quotes, but also in the entire financial market, if the ECB
leaders make an unexpected statement. Similar previous decisions by the
ECB on interest rates and subsequent press conferences have moved the
euro rate by 3-5% in a short time. The ECB leaders will assess the
current economic situation in the Eurozone and comment on the ECB's rate
decision.

The soft tone of the statements will have a negative impact on the euro.
Conversely, the tough tone of the ECB leadership on the central bank's
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) will strengthen the euro.

###  **Friday, October 30**

###  **07:00 EUR Retail sales in Germany**

Retail sales is the main indicator of consumer spending in Germany
showing changes in retail sales. A high result strengthens the euro, and
vice versa, a low result weakens it. Forecast: +0.5% (+4.2% y/y) in
October against +3.1% (+3.7% y/y in September, -0.9% (+4.2% y/y) [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/))
in July, -1.6% (+5.9% y/y) in June, +13.9% and +3.8% (y/y) in May.

The data suggests some improvement in sales indicators, but this is
likely to have a strong positive effect on the euro only in the short
term, if any.

###  **09:00 EUR Consumer Price Index. Core CPI (preliminary release).
Eurozone GDP for the 3rd quarter (preliminary estimate)**

Consumer Price Index (CPI) is published by Eurostat and measures the
price change of a selected basket of goods and services over a given
period. The index is a key indicator for assessing inflation and
changing purchasing habits. A positive result strengthens the EUR, a
negative one weakens it. In January, the CPI index increased by 1.4% (in
annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)), in February - by +1.2%, in March - by +0.7%, in April -
by +0.3%, in May - by +0.1%, and in August it fell by -0.2%, which
indicates low inflationary pressure and even a slowdown in inflation.
Forecast for September: +0.2% (annualized). If the data turns out to be
worse than forecast, the euro may fall sharply in the short term. The
data better than the forecast and / or the previous value may strengthen
the euro in the short-term, despite the low value (the target level of
consumer inflation by the ECB is slightly below 2.0%).

Core Consumer Price Index (Core CPI) determines the change in prices of
a selected basket of goods and services for a given period and is a key
indicator for assessing inflation and changes in consumer preferences.
Food and energy have been excluded from this indicator to provide a more
accurate estimate. A high result strengthens the EUR, while a low result
weakens it. In January, Core CPI increased by 1.1% (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)), in
February - by +1.2%, in March - by +1.0%, in April and May - by +0.9%,
and in August - by +0.4%. If the data for September turn out to be worse
than the previous value or forecast, it may negatively affect the euro.
If the data turn out to be better than the forecast or the previous
value, the euro is likely to respond with an increase in quotations, but
only in the short term. Inflation in the Eurozone remains low, which is
a negative factor for the euro. Forecast for September: +0.7%.

GDP is considered to be an indicator of the overall health of the
Eurozone economy. A growing trend in GDP is considered positive for the
EUR; a low result weakens the EUR.

Recently, macro data from the Eurozone have been showing a gradual
recovery in the European economy after a sharp decline earlier this
year. However, the decision made by the EU leaders in July on additional
economic support (a package of expenditures for the economic recovery of
the bloc in the amount of 1.8 trillion euros was approved) will help
stabilize the economy of the Eurozone. At the moment, as a result of
quarantine restrictions, restrained spending by companies and consumers,
as well as the collapse of exports, the economy is on the cusp of the
deepest economic downturn since World War II.

The euro reacted positively to this decision. However, economists
forecast that Eurozone GDP will fall by -14.1% in Q3 (-16.9% yoy) after
falling by -11.8% (-14.7% yoy) in the 2nd quarter and a decline of -3.6%
(-3.1% YoY) in the 1st quarter of 2020.

If the data turns out to be even weaker, the euro could fall sharply.
Better-than-forecast data may strengthen the euro in the short term,
although it is still far from the full recovery of the European economy
even to pre-crisis levels (quarterly growth within 0.2% - 0.4%).
