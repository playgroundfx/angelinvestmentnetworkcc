Short-term forecast for BTCUSD, XRPUSD and ETHUSD 06.05.2021Roman Onegin

I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I offer entry signals to
trade each cryptocurrency.

Bitcoin and Ethereum are depreciating, while Ripple is rising in price.

The article covers the following subjects:

## Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis

The BTCUSD continues forming a large bear impulse wave. So far, there
completed sub-waves 1 and 2; wave 1 is an impulse, and correction 2 is a
double zigzag. It is clear from the most recent chart section that there
have completed two sub-waves of a smaller degree, [1] and [2].
Therefore, the Bitcoin price should continue declining in impulse [3] to
a level below the low of 47000.00.

### Trading plan for [BTCUSD][1] today:

Sell 57049.50, TP 47000.00

## Elliott wave Ripple analysis

The XRPUSD market is forming the beginning of a large bullish, with the
first two sub-waves [1] and [2] completed inside. There have completed
sub-waves (1) and (2), which are the elements of bullish wave [3]. Over
the next few days, the Ripple price should be rising in the impulse
upwave (3) to a level above 1.961, marked by wave [1]. One could enter
buy trades.

### Trading plan for [XRPUSD][2] today:

Buy 1.682, TP 1.961

## Elliott wave Ethereum analysis

The ETHUSD market is developing the initial part of a new bearish trend
as the large impulse wave C has completed. Over the next few days, the
Ethereum price should be declining to a level below 2730.00. One could
enter short trades in the current situation with a target around level
2730.00

### Trading plan for [ETHUSD][3] **** today:

Sell 3443.42, TP 2730.00
