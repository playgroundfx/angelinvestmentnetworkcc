Gold is to rise. Forecast as of 06.05.2021Dmitri Demidenko

Does it make any sense to discuss the tightening of the Fed’s monetary
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) if the US economy hasn’t yet opened in full and the inflation
hasn’t reached 3%-3.5%? How does Fed’s [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) affect the gold prices?
Let us analyze the gold outlook and make up a trading plan

### Weekly gold fundamental forecast

The successful result requires coordination and unity. If there had not
been agreement among the Fed’s members in March 2020, the central bank
would not have supported the US economy with such a significant monetary
stimulus. Nonetheless, when all FOMC representatives stick to the same
speeches, there is a risk of missing something important. There could be
an alternative scenario, suggested by financial markets and totally
rejected by the Fed. Such a situation creates a favorable environment
for gold.

People who forget about past mistakes could make them again. For
experienced [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s, the current situation seems similar to that of
the 1970s when a boom in commodity markets and problems with supply
triggered a sharp rise in inflation. The surge of the Bloomberg
Commodity Index, being driven by oil, to its ten-year highs pushes
global manufacturing prices to their highest levels since 2009. The US
producer prices are up to the highest levels since 2008. Supply
disruptions due to the increase in demand are a matter of concern.

Inflation expectations are rising, but the Fed ignores this fact. Even,
the Fed’s hawks, such as  Boston's Eric Rosengren and Cleveland's
Loretta Mester, believe the potential inflation surge is temporary.
Mester believes some increase in inflation expectations and actual
inflation would be a welcome development, as the inflation pressure has
been low for a long time. Rosengren notes that the US economy needs
compensation for the downturn during the recession. The statements that
it is too early to unwind the monetary stimulus and taper the QE will
surprise nobody. Therefore, the [XAUUSD][1] bulls go ahead.

### Dynamics of US inflation expectations

The story that gold is growing due to the acceleration of inflation, a
hedging tool against which it has been for many centuries, is a
beautiful fairy tale. No more. In fact, precious metals are just as much
an asset as stocks or bonds, and their share in investment portfolios
increases at a time when Treasury yields are [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/)ly low or
falling. At the same time, Treasury nominal yields do not go up because
of the Fed's willingness to allow the economy to overheat, while real
yields do not go up because of rising inflationary expectations.
Furthermore, the greenback is weakening, so the  [XAUUSD][1] bulls
naturally go ahead.

### Weekly gold trading plan

Gold could start falling in price if the Fed’s stance changes. It will
hardly happen before the third quarter, as the US economy has not fully
reopened, and the inflation hasn’t hit 3%-3.5%. So, I do not think the
increase in inflation this year should be the type of sustainable
increase However, market conditions should change, and the Fed will have
to tighten monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). I do not think it will hike the federal
funds rate this or next year. So, gold should not have exhausted its
growth potential. If the gold price breaks out the resistance at $1800,
one could add up to the longs entered in the [zone of $1750-$1755][2].
