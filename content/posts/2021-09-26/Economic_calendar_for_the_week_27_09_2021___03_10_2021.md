Economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the week 27.09.2021 – 03.10.2021Jana Kane

##  **Review of the main events of the Forex economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the
next trading week (27.09.2021 – 03.10.2021)**

Having received support from the sharply increased US government bond
yields, the dollar closed last week with a slight gain. The DXY dollar
index reflecting the value of the dollar against a basket of 6 major
currencies added 0.14% last week. The growth of the dollar was
constrained by disagreements among the Fed leaders over the future plans
of the central bank's monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).

Based on the forecasts presented last Wednesday at the Fed meeting, only
half of its leaders believe that by the end of 2023, rates will need to
be raised by 1 percentage point from current levels and by another three
quarters of a percentage point in 2024.

The other half of the Fed officials called for even greater caution in
raising rates, pointing to the risks associated with an increase in the
number of cases of Covid-19, which could lead to another round of
economic recession and a slowdown in the recovery of the labor market.

The American economy has created an estimated 4.7 million jobs to date,
less than half of those lost since the start of the pandemic, when 10
million Americans lost their jobs. Also, most Fed leaders believe that
inflation will slow to 2.3% in 2022 and to 2.2% in 2023.

Since the full recovery of the American labor market is still far away,
judging by the latest data, the prospect of an increase in interest
rates by the Fed may also move again to a later date, despite the
official statement of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC),
according to which the slowdown in asset purchases may be announced at
the next meeting, which will take place on November 2-3.

At the same time, optimism seems to be returning to global stock
exchanges.

So, following the results of a very volatile trading week, the main
American stock indices closed it in positive territory with a small
gain.

Next week will be transitional between September and October, as well as
between the 3rd and 4th quarters of the year, and financial market
participants will pay attention to the publication of important macro
statistics from the US, Germany, Eurozone, Australia, China, the UK, and
Canada.

 ***during the coming week, new events may be added to the [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) and
/ or some scheduled events may be canceled**

 ****GMT time**

###  **Monday, September 27**

###  **12:30 USD Durable goods orders. Capital goods orders (ex defense
and aviation)**

This indicator reflects the value of orders received by manufacturers of
durable goods and capital goods (capital goods are durable commodities
used to produce durable goods and services), involving large
investments. Commodities produced in the defense and aviation sectors of
the US economy are not included in this indicator. A strong result
strengthens the USD. Previous values ​​of the indicator "durable goods
orders": -0.1% in July, +0.9% in June, +2.3% in May, -1.3% in April, +1%
in March, -1.2% in February, +3.4% in January 2021.

Previous values ​​of the indicator "capital goods orders ex defense and
aviation": 0% in July, +0.7% in June, +0.1% in May, +2.2% in April, +1%
in March, -0.9% in February, +0.6% in January 2021.

In theory, the relative growth of the indicator has a positive effect on
the dollar; the market reaction to its negative value may be negative
for the dollar in the short term. Data worse than the previous value
will also negatively affect the dollar quotes.

Forecast for August: +0.6% (durable goods orders), + 0.5% (capital goods
orders ex defense and aviation).

It seems that the growth of indicators has slowed down, although it
continues after their recovery in previous months from a sharp drop in
March and April 2020, which should have a positive effect on the dollar
quotes. Better-than-expected data will also have a positive impact on
the dollar.

###  **23:50 JPY Bank of Japan Monetary Policy Committee meeting**

At this meeting, the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Japan will
once again sum up the results of the bank's regular meeting last week,
analyze the economic situation in Japan and give indications on possible
future prospects for the Bank of Japan's financial [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).

If the tone of the minutes of the meeting indicates the firmness of
intentions of the Bank of Japan regarding monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) in the
country, it will negatively affect the Japanese stock market and
strengthen the yen. Conversely, a soft rhetoric about the bank's
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) prospects will contribute to the weakening of the yen
and the growth of the Japanese stock market.

###  **Tuesday, September 28**

###  **00:30 AUD Retail Sales Index**

Retail Sales Index is published monthly by the Australian Bureau of
Statistics and measures total retail sales. The index is often
considered an indicator of consumer confidence and reflects the health
of the retail sector in the near term. A rise in the index is usually
positive for the AUD; a decrease in the indicator will negatively affect
the AUD. The previous value of the index (in July) was -2.7% (after
falling by -1.8% in June). If the data turns out to be weaker than the
previous value, the AUD may sharply decline in the short term, but if
it's above the previous values, the AUD is likely to strengthen.

###  **Wedensday, September 29**

No important macro statistics planned to be released.

###  **Thursday, September 30**

###  **01:00 CNY China Services and Manufacturing PMIs from the China
Federation of Logistics and Purchasing (CFLP)**

These indicators assess the state of the services and the manufacturing
sectors in the Chinese economy. A result above 50 is considered positive
and strengthens the yuan. Previous PMI values ​​for the services sector:
47.5 in August, 53.3 in July, 55.2 in May, 56.3 in March, 51.4 in
February, 52.4 in January. The indicator is above 50, which is likely to
have a positive effect on the yuan quotes, even with a slight relative
decline. If the indicator is below 50, the yuan will be under pressure
and likely to decline. Forecast for September: 53.2.

Previous PMI values ​​for the manufacturing sector: 50.1 in August, 50.4
in July, 51.0 in May, 51.9 in March, 50.6 in February, 51.3 in January.

The relative growth of the index and the indicator above the value of 50
should have a positive effect on the CNY. The data above 50 indicates an
increase in activity, which has a positive effect on the quotes of the
national currency. In the opposite case, and if the indicator is below
50, the yuan will be under pressure and probably will decrease. Forecast
for September: 50.2.

###  **06:00 GBP UK GDP for Q2 (final estimate)**

GDP is considered to be an indicator of the overall health of the
British economy. The upward trend in GDP is considered positive for the
GBP. The UK's GDP was one of the highest in the world until 2016, when
the Brexit referendum was held. Subsequently, its growth slowed down,
and with the onset of the global coronavirus pandemic, the growth rate
of British GDP went into negative territory altogether.

The preliminary forecast for the 2nd quarter was +4.8% (+22.1% YoY)
after falling -1.6% in the 1st quarter of 2021, -19.8% in the 2nd
quarter and +1.3% growth in Q4 2020). The main factors that can force
the Bank of England to keep rates low are weak GDP and labor market
growth, as well as low consumer spending. If the GDP data turn out to be
even worse than the negative forecast (-1.5% and -6.1% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)),
it will put downward pressure on the pound. Strong GDP report will
strengthen the pound.

###  **09:00 EUR Consumer Price Index. Core CPI (preliminary release)**

Consumer Price Index (CPI) is published by Eurostat and measures the
price change of a selected basket of goods and services over a given
period. The index is a key indicator for assessing inflation and changes
in purchasing habits. A positive result strengthens the EUR, a negative
one weakens it. At the end of 2020, the CPI index fell by -0.3%, which
indicated low inflationary pressures and even a slowdown in inflation.
However, in 2021, inflation in the Eurozone began to accelerate,
periodically exceeding the target level of the ECB.

Previous CPI values: +3.0% in August, +2.2% in July, +1.9% in June,
+2.0% in May, +1.3% in March, +0.9% in January and February. If the data
turns out to be worse, the euro may fall sharply in the short term. Data
better than the previous value may strengthen the euro in the short
term. It should also be kept in mind that the target level of consumer
inflation by the ECB is slightly below 2.0%.

Core Consumer Price Index (Core CPI) determines the change in prices of
a selected basket of goods and services for a given period and is a key
indicator for assessing inflation and changes in consumer preferences.
Food and energy have been excluded from this indicator to provide a more
accurate estimate. A high result strengthens the EUR, while a low result
weakens it. In August 2021, Core CPI increased by +1.6%, by +0.7% in
July, +0.9% in June, +1.0% in May, by +0.7% in April (annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/))
after more modest values ​​of +0.2% in the period from September to
December 2020. If the data for September turn out to be worse than the
previous value, it may negatively affect the euro. If the data turn out
to be better than the forecast or the previous value, the euro is likely
to respond with an increase in quotations, but only in the short term.
Core inflation in the Eurozone remains low, which is a negative factor
for the euro.

###  **12:00 EUR Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) in Germany
(preliminary release)**

This index is published by the EU Statistical Office and is calculated
on the basis of a statistical method agreed between all EU countries. It
is an indicator for assessing inflation and is used by the Governing
Council of the ECB to assess the level of price stability. A positive
result strengthens the EUR, a negative one weakens it.

Previous indicator values: +3.4% in August, +3.1% in July, +2.1% in
June, +2.4% in May, +2.1% in April, +2.0% in March, +1.6% in January and
February, -0.7% in December and negative values ​​in the second half of
2020 (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)). If the data turn out to be better than the
previous values, the euro may strengthen in the short term. The growth
of the indicator is a positive factor for the euro. The data suggests
increasing inflationary pressures in Germany. Data worse than the
previous value will negatively affect the euro.

###  **12:30 USD US Annual GDP for Q2 (final estimate)**

GDP data is one of the key indicators (along with data on the labor
market and inflation) for the Fed in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of its monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).
Strong result strengthens the US dollar; a weak GDP report negatively
affects the US dollar. In the previous 1st quarter, GDP grew by +6.4%,
in the 4th quarter - by +4.3% after growing by +33.4% in the 3rd quarter
of 2020, and after falling by -31. 4% in Q2 and -5.0% in Q1 2020.

If the data points to a decline in GDP in the 2nd quarter, the dollar
will come under pressure. The positive data on GDP will support the
dollar and the American stock indices, although they are already mostly
priced in. The preliminary forecast for the 2nd quarter of 2021 was
+8.2%, and the actual value is +6.6%.

###  **23:50 JPY Tankan Large Manufacturers Index**

This index reflects general business conditions for large manufacturing
companies in Japan and is an indicator of the current state of Japan's
export-oriented economy, which is heavily dependent on the industrial
sector.

Rising values ​​and the value of the indicator above 0 (zero is the
middle line) is a positive factor for the JPY, and the value of the
indicator below 0 is negative.

According to the forecast, the index value is expected to be 13 (for the
3rd quarter of 2021) after rising to a value of 14 in the 2nd quarter of
2021 and falling to -10 in the 4th quarter of 2020 (-27 and -34 in the
3rd and Q2 2020, respectively), which is likely to support the yen, but
above all Japanese stock indices, despite a slight relative decline in
the indicator.

###  **Friday, October 1**

###  **06:00 EUR Retail sales in Germany**

Retail sales is the main indicator of consumer spending in Germany
showing changes in retail sales. A high result strengthens the euro, and
vice versa, a low result weakens it. Forecast: -0.9% (+3.7% yoy) in
August against -5.1% (-0.3% yoy) in July, +4.2% (+6.2% yoy) annualized)
in June, +4.2% (-2.4% yoy) in May, -2.0% (+4.4% yoy) in April, +7.7%
(+11 % in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) in March, +1.2% (-9.0% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) in
February, -4.5% (-8.7% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) in January.

The data indicate the instability of the recovery of this sector of the
German economy, including due to lockdowns due to coronavirus. Better-
than-expected data is likely to have a positive effect on the euro, but
in the short term.

###  **14:00** **USD US Manufacturing PMI** **(by ISM)**

Published by the Institute for Supply Management (ISM), the US
Manufacturing PMI is an important indicator of the health of the US
economy as a whole. A result above 50 is seen as positive and
strengthens the USD, one below 50 - as negative for the US dollar.
Forecast: 59.9 in September (against 59.9 in August, 59.5 in July, 60.6
in June, 61.2 in May, 60.7 in April, 64.7 in March, 60.8 in February
58.7 in January, 60.7 in December). The index is above the 50 level and
has a relatively high value, which is likely to support the dollar,
despite the relative slight decline in the indicator. The data above the
value of 50 indicates an acceleration of activity, which has a positive
effect on the quotes of the national currency. If the indicator falls
below the forecast and especially below the value of 50, the dollar may
sharply weaken in the short term.
