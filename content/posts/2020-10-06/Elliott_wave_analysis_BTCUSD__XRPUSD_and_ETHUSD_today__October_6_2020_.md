I welcome my readers!

I have prepared a short-term cryptocurrency forecast based on Elliott
wave analysis of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum. I suggest entry signals
to trade each cryptocurrency.

All cryptocurrency pairs analyzed in the article are forming the bullish
corrective sub-waves. The Bitcoin price is to be rising in the impulse
wave C to a level of 11315, as the impulse is half-complete as of now.

The article covers the following subjects:

##  **Elliott wave Bitcoin analysis**

 ****

The BTCUSD market continues forming the upward linking wave [X]. It is
developing as a double zigzag (W)-(X)-(Y). The sub-waves (W) and (X)
have completed, the (Y) wave is yet unfolding, it is about to end soon.
The impulse wave A and the B correction must have completed. In the
short run, the price should be rising in C towards a level of 11315. One
could enter long positions under the current conditions.

##  **Elliott wave Ripple analysis**

 ****

The XRPUSD market continues forming the simple down zigzag A-B-C. The
impulse wave A has completed, it is composed of the sub-waves
[1]-[2]-[3]-[4]-[5]. There is now developing the bullish correction B as
a zigzag [a]-[b]-[c]. The impulse wave [a] and the corrective wave [b]
have completed, and the market is now following the bullish impulse [c].
Within the [c] impulse. The impulse wave (3) has finished. After a short
decline in correction (4), the market could start rising in wave (5) to
a level of 0.266.

that is an element of a new downtrend, unfolding as an impulse. Wave [2]
is likely to end as a standard zigzag (a)-(b)-(c). The market is now
forming the final leg of this zigzag, the (c) impulse. In the short run,
the price could be rising in the (c) impulse to a level of 370.00. One
