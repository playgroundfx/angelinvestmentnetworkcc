Dollar: was there a fact? Forecast as of 06.10.2020Dmitri Demidenko

Despite the uncertainty, the [EURUSD][1] pair is rising as Joe Biden is
more likely to win the election. Trump is not going to give in and could
resort to political tricks. I will speculate about these issues and
offer a [EURUSD][1] trading plan.

## Fundamental US dollar forecast today

The US dollar quickly responds to changing market conditions. It
strengthens during the period of uncertainty, serving as a safe haven.
It stays aside when [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are optimistic about the future of the
world economy. US presidential election is a source of the market
turmoil, so the greenback forgets about economic performance and
responds to the candidates' approval ratings. According to the polls by
the Wall Street Journal and NBC News, Joe Biden has become 14 basis
points more popular than Donald Trump after the debate. This is the
widest gap in 2020. The previous high of 11 basis points was recorded in
July.

Over the past three presidential campaigns, the US dollar was
strengthening in October amid a US stock indexes drawdown and political
uncertainty. On the contrary, at the end of the fourth quarter over the
past 10 years, the USD index and the [S&P 500][2] added 1.7% and 1.9% on
average. Besides, the IS stock market usually outperformed foreign
peers. The positive correlation was supported by the US economy's
leading growth and using the greenback as an income-generating currency
in carry trades. In October ahead of the presidential election, the
correlation between the USD and the [S&P 500][2] was negative.

The Fed’s aggressive monetary expansion made the dollar less appealing
for carry traders. According to Chicago Federal Reserve Bank President
Charles Evans, if the central bank had used the average inflation
targeting [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) earlier, a part of the interest rates hiking in
2015-2018 might not have taken place. The greenback can’t follow up on
the growth of the US stock indexes any longer only because the Treasury
yields are higher than their peers in the advanced economies. The USD
can now benefit only from the divergence in the economic expansion.

This fact is included in the forecasts of the Reuters experts. 54 out of
75 specialists believe the dollar won’t be rising for more than three
months. 13 analysts are sure the greenback’s rally has been already
over. The median gauges on the [EURUSD][1] are 1.18 and 1.21 in 3 and 12
months.

The Forex turmoil is not likely to last for a long time. There are
several reasons for the soon improvement of market conditions. Trump is
recovering, Joe Biden’s approval rating is increasing, and [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s
have a different view of the influence of Biden’s victory on the
financial markets. The return of the US president to the White House
will eliminate the disputes with the US administration. Joe Biden’s
victory is likely to result in adopting the additional fiscal stimulus
by the Congress, which is positive for the [S&P 500][2].

### [EURUSD][1] trading plan today

What can support the greenback? The agreement on the additional
financial assistance between the Democrats and the Republicans and the
sympathy with Trump because of his illness. Both facts can raise Trump’s
rating, and so support the US dollar. If so, there is a reasonable
question. Was Trump really ill with COVID-19? While [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are
discussing this topic, the [EURUSD][1] might test the resistance zone of
1.179-1.18. In case of a successful test, the pair can well continue the
rally to 1.1865-1.1875.
