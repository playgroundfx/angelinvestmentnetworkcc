Weekly forecast for oil, gold and EUR/USDAlex Rodionov

##  **O** **il price forecast for next wee** **k: USCrude analysis**

Oil has featured low volatility this week. Basically, the situation in
the oil market has been the same for the third consecutive week. The
price is trading under the resistance Target Zone 5 [41.67 – 40.92],
with insignificant fluctuations.

The oil middle-term trend remains up. Therefore, we can expect the price
to break through the June’s high and consolidate above TZ5. When it
happens, the next upside target will be Target Zone 6 [49.19 – 48.42].

The key support is now in the price range of [33.64 – 32.86]. To buy oil
at good prices, we need to expect the test of the support zone and look
for a pattern.

##  **Gold** **price forecast for next wee** **k:** **XAUUSD**
**analysis** ****

Gold middle-term uptrend continues. The price is now being corrected.

Next week, I expect the price to break through the local high. Next we
shall see if the bulls will consolidate the price above Target Zone 6
[1817.2 – 1811.2]. If they do, the next growth target in the uptrend
will be Target Zone 7 [1877.2 – 1871.2].

If there is a false breakout pattern in the gold price chart, one can
use it and sell gold with the target in the key support zone.

Sell according to the pattern “false breakout of high”. TakeProfit: key
support. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

##  **E** **uro/dollar price forecast for next wee** **k:** **EURUSD**
**analysis** ****

This week, the EURUSD purchases, opened earlier, have yielded profit at
level 1.1410. The high of June has been broken through. The main
scenario to buy the euro has worked out.

![LiteForex: Weekly forecast for oil, gold and EUR/USD][5]

The EURUSD traders are now trying to consolidate the price above the
resistance [1.1368 – 1.1350]. I recommend combining this resistance zone
with level 1.1410 and considering them as the single strong zone. If
buyers consolidate the price above this zone, the price will be likely
to reach Target Zone 2 [1.1550 – 1.1532].

Until the price consolidates above the resistance, we continue looking
for entry points to enter middle-term purchases with the target at the
high of this week. The key support with good buy prices is in the zone
of [1.1269 – 1.1251]. Expect the price correction down to this zone

###  **[EURUSD][7]  Trading tips for the upcoming week:**

Buy according to the pattern in Target Zone [1.1269 - 1.1251].
TakeProfit: 1.1450. StopLoss: according to the pattern rules.

> IZ - Intermediary Zone: responsible for the price momentum reversing

>

> TZ - Target Zone: a zone that is 75% likely to be reached after IZ
breakout.

>

> GZ - Gold Zone: zone in the medium-term momentum.

>

> All zones are calculated based on the average [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) price of the
instrument and margin requirements of the futures.
