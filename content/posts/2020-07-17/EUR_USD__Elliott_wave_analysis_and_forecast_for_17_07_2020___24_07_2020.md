EUR/USD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 17/07/2020 –
24/07/2020Alex Geuta

## The pair [EUR/USD][1] remains likely to grow. Estimated pivot point
is at a level of 1.1321.

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions from corrections above the
level of 1.1321 with a target of 1.1495 – 1.1605.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
1.1321 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of 1.1173
– 1.1088.

 **Analysis:** Supposedly, a descending correction of larger degree
finished developing on the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame in the form of wave (2) and
the third wave (3) started developing. On the H4 time frame the first
counter-trend wave 1 of (3) is forming, with wave iii of 1 continuing to
form inside. Apparently, the fifth wave of smaller degree (v) of iii of
1 is developing on the H1 time frame, with wave iii of (v) developing
inside. If the presumption is correct, the pair will continue to rise to
the levels of 1.1495 – 1.1605. The level of 1.1321 is critical in this
scenario. Its breakout will allow the pair to continue falling to the
levels of 1.1173 – 1.1088.
