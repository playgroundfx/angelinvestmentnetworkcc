EUR/USD forecast: Dollar is risingDmitri Demidenko

##  **Fundamental US dollar forecast for today**

### How deep will the EUR/USD fall?

The less you know, the better. The European Central Bank President
Christine Lagarde hasn’t mentioned the disputes among the members of the
Governing Council. She said the central bank currently expects to spend
the full amount of its pandemic bond-buying program unless there isn’t a
significant surprise, but the markets suggest something different.
According to Bloomberg’s sources familiar with the matter, [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers
didn’t come to an agreement on whether the full program was likely to be
used. Some Executive Board members argue that the improving economy may
mean bond-buying could end before reaching the current cap. If it was
officially announced, it would cancel the ECB’s baseline projection is
for an 8.7% contraction in the euro-area economy this year. However, the
ECB is not yet prepared to send such a message.

Lagarde stresses that the euro-area recovery remains partial and uneven,
with risks still tilted to the downside. She says the ECB’s monetary
stimulus will add 1.3% to the GDP and 0.8% to the inflation rate by
2022. The Governing Council is again divided into hawks and doves. The
rich North is opposed to the poor South. So it is not surprising that
some [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers suggest the end of the bond-buying program, and other
Executive Board members offer to expand it. According to the forecasts
of the European Commission, the GDPs of Italy, France, and Spain will be
down by approximately 11.5%, and Germany’s economy will lose half as
much.

The lack of agreement among the ECB governors could eliminate such a
benefit of the euro as the euro-area unity. It is extremely dangerous
ahead of the EU summit. If the bloc doesn’t approve of the French-German
750 billion-euro recovery fund will set a date for an extraordinary
meeting to continue discussions on this topic, the [EUR/USD][1] bulls
will be set back.

In the US, however, the retail sales data and homebuilders’ outlook are
is back at pre-pandemic levels. Furthermore, the Fed’s balance sheet
fell by $210 billion since June 10, being back below $7 trillion. If the
US economy performs better than it could be expected considering the
growth in the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) COVID-19 cases to more than 70,000, then why should
the Fed continue taking active measures? According to the forecast of
Wall Street experts, the Fed’s balance sheet should rise to $8.5
trillion by the end of 2020, instead of $9.5 trillion expected earlier.

In addition to the improved domestic data in the US, [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s consider
such a bullish driver for the greenback as the escalation of the US-
China trade war. The White House is not happy that the Chinese GDP grew
by 3.2% in the second quarter, while the US GDP is likely to be down by
10% in the same period. A faster economic recovery will allow China’s
exporters to boost their share in the market, and so, make one more step
forward to the world’s leadership.

In my opinion, the down moves of the [EUR/USD][1] are nothing more than
just a correction. An increase in the number of coronavirus cases will
suggest worse economic data of the US for June, which, amid the main
investment idea based on the divergence in the economic growth, should
encourage the [EUR/USD][1] bulls to go ahead. If the EU governments
agree on the fiscal stimulus package, the euro buyers will feel more
confident. In the meanwhile, the major currency pair meets my
expectations and consolidates in the range of [1.11-1.14][3]. The euro
is more likely to rise to $1.16 and higher than to fall to $1.11.
