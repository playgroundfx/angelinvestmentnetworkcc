The BTCUSD forecast is forming the long-term uptrend, with the
corrective wave recently [4] completed within. Correction [4] is
composed of three major sub-waves (W)-(X)-(Y). The sub-waves (W) and (X)
are simple zigzags, wave (Y) is a bearish double zigzag. Next, the
market has turned up and started forming the initial phase of the new
uptrend. The Bitcoin price should be rising in the next few weeks.

double zigzag [w]-[x]-[y]. There is now developing the initial phase of
wave 5. The Ripple price should be rising in wave 5 in the next few

there should be developing the final wave [5] of (5), which could
