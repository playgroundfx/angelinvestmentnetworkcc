USD/JPY: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 17/07/2020 –
24/07/2020Alex Geuta

## [USD/JPY][1] remains likely to fall. Estimated pivot point is at a
level of 107.81.

 **Main scenario:** consider short positions from corrections below the
level of 107.81 with a target of 106.00 – 105.21.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation above the level of
107.81 will allow the pair to continue rising to the levels of 108.60 –
109.84.

 **Analysis:** On the [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) time frame, apparently a descending
correction of larger degree finished forming as wave B and wave С
started developing, with wave 1 of (1) of C formed inside. On the H4
time frame, a descending correction is forming as wave 2 of (1) in the
form of double zigzag wxy, inside which wave y of 2 is forming.
Apparently,  wave (c) of y of 2 is forming on the H1 time frame, with a
local correction nearing completion inside as wave iv of (c). If the
presumption is correct, the pair will continue to drop to the levels of
106.00 – 105.21. The level of 107.81 is critical in this scenario as the
breakout will enable the pair to continue growing to the levels of
108.60 – 109.84.
