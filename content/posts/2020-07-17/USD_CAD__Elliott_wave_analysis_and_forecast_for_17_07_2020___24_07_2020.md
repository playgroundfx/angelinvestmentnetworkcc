USD/CAD: Elliott wave analysis and forecast for 17/07/2020 –
24/07/2020Alex Geuta

## [USD/CAD][1] remains likely to grow. Estimated pivot point is at a
level of 1.3488.

 **Main scenario:** consider long positions from corrections above the
level of 1.3488 with a target of  1.3828 – 1.4052.

 **Alternative scenario:** breakout and consolidation below the level of
1.3488 will allow the pair to continue declining to the levels of 1.3315
– 1.3189.

 **Analysis:** Supposedly, a descending correction has formed as the
fourth wave of larger degree (4) on the D1 time frame. On the H4 time
frame, the fifth wave (5) has started forming, with wave 1 of (5)
forming inside. On the H1 time frame, apparently a local correction of
smaller degree finished developing as wave ii of 1 and wave iii of 1
started forming. If the presumption is correct, the pair may be expected
to rise to the  levels of 1.3828 – 1.4052. The level of 1.3488 is
critical in this scenario as the breakout will enable the pair to
continue declining to the levels of 1.3315 – 1.3189.
