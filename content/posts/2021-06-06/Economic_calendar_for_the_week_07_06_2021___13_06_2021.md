Economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the week 07.06.2021 – 13.06.2021Jana Kane

##  **Review of the main events of the Forex economic [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) for the
next trading week (07.06.2021 – 13.06.2021)**

 **Trading on key Forex [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/): next week we expect the publication of
important macro statistics from China, Japan, the US, Germany, Eurozone,
as well as the results of the meetings of the central banks of Canada
and the Eurozone.**

In the last two days (Thursday and Friday) of the past week, there was a
surge in volatility on the foreign exchange market associated with the
publication of macro statistics on the United States.

On Thursday, dollar buyers and market participants who are betting on
its further strengthening received strong support from the data
exceeding expectations in the US labor market and from IHS Markit and
the ISM Institute, which reported the growth of business activity in the
services sector of the US economy. At the same time, the US Department
of Labor reported that the number of initial applications for
unemployment benefits last week fell by 20,000, reaching 385,000 against
the forecast of 393,000, and data from the ADP recorded a significant
increase in employment in May (+978 thousand against the forecast 650
thousand). The dollar strengthened strongly after the release of macro
data, which indicated the acceleration of the recovery of the American
economy emerging from the drawdown after the pandemic. However, the
dollar was unable to develop an upward movement on Friday after the
official data from the US labor market came out with contradictory
indicators. The US Labor Department data showed that non-farm jobs in
the US grew slightly weaker than economists expected, although
unemployment fell more than expected. Economists had expected non-farm
jobs to rise by 671,000 in May and unemployment at 5.9%. In fact,
559,000 jobs were created in May, while unemployment fell to 5.8%.

In general, these statistics showed that the labor market is improving
but not at the rate that could force the Fed to soon abandon additional
support for the economy.

Market participants began to close long positions in the dollar after
the publication of data from the labor market, which led to a decline in
the dollar. As a result, the DXY dollar index closed last week at the
same levels as a week ago, near the 90.00 mark, and the major American
stock indices closed last week with another gain, albeit small.

Nevertheless, optimism prevails on global stock exchanges, associated
with expectations of a further recovery in the global economy, both
against the background of the unfolding vaccination against coronavirus
in Europe and North America, and over the soft [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) of the world's
largest central banks.

Next week, financial market participants will pay attention to the
publication of important macro statistics from China, Japan, the US,
Germany, Eurozone, and the results of the meeting of the central banks
of Canada and the Eurozone.

 **Traders should pay attention to the publication of the following
macro indicators:**

 ***during the coming week, new events may be added to the [calendar](https://www.fintechee.com/web-trader/) and
/ or some scheduled events may be canceled**

###  **23:50 JPY Japan GDP for the 1st quarter of 2021 (second
estimate)**

GDP is considered an indicator of the general state of a country's
economy and estimates the rate of its growth or decline. The report on
gross domestic product published by the Cabinet of Ministers of Japan
expresses in monetary [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) the total value of all final goods and
services produced by Japan over a certain period of time. An upward
trend in the GDP indicator is considered a positive factor for the
national currency (yen), while a low result is considered negative (or
bearish).

In the previous 4th quarter of 2020, the country's GDP grew by +2.8%
(+11.7% on an annualized basis) after falling in the first half of 2020.
The preliminary estimate implied GDP growth in the 4th quarter of 2020
by +3.0% or +12.7% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/).

The data points to continued recovery in the Japanese economy after
falling due to the coronavirus pandemic. However, the forecast implies
that in the 1st quarter of 2021, Japan's GDP contracted by -1.2% (-4.8%
in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)), which is a negative factor, primarily for the Japanese
stock market.

The preliminary estimate implied a decrease in GDP in the 1st quarter of
2021 by -1.3% (-5.1% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)). If the data turns out to be
weaker, the yen may strengthen against the background of the fall in the
Japanese stock market in the short term. Better-than-expected data is
likely to help the Japanese stock market rally. However, it should also
be noted that in recent weeks, financial market participants pay little
attention to [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) and weak macro statistics, abandoning defensive
assets, including the yen, in favor of more risky and profitable stock
market assets.

###  **Tuesday, June 8**

###  **09:00 EUR Eurozone GDP for the 1st quarter (final estimate)**

GDP is considered an indicator of the overall health of the economy. The
upward trend in GDP is considered positive for the EUR; a poor result
weakens the EUR.

Recently, macro data from the Eurozone have been indicating a gradual
recovery in the growth rate of the European economy after a sharp drop
in early 2020. However, the decision made by the EU leaders in July to
provide additional support to the economy (a package of spending on the
economic recovery of the bloc in the amount of 1.8 trillion euros was
approved) will help stabilize the economy of the Eurozone, which, as a
result of quarantine restrictions, restraint in spending by companies
and consumers, as well as a collapse exports are on the cusp of the
deepest economic downturn since World War II.

The euro reacted positively to this decision.

Nevertheless, according to the forecast of economists, the GDP of the
Eurozone is expected to fall in the 1st quarter of 2021 by -0.6% (by
-1.8% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) after falling by -0.7% (-4.9% in annualized) in
the 4th quarter of 2020, an increase of +12.5% ​​(a fall of -4.3% in
annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)) in the 3rd quarter, a fall of -11.8% (-14.7% in YoY) in
the 2nd quarter and a decline of -3.6% (-3.1% YoY) in the 1st quarter of
2020. The previous estimate was the same: a fall of -0.6% (-1.8% in
annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)).

If the data turn out to be weaker than the forecast, the euro may
decline. Better-than-forecast data may strengthen the euro in the short
term, although it is still far from the full recovery of the European
economy even to pre-crisis levels (quarterly growth within 0.2% - 0.4%).

###  **01:30** **CNY Consumer Price Index (** **CPI)**

The National Bureau of Statistics of China will release another monthly
data reflecting the dynamics of consumer prices in China. Rising
consumer prices could trigger an acceleration in inflation, which could
force the People's Bank of China to take measures aimed at tightening
fiscal [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/). Increased growth in consumer inflation may cause
appreciation of the yuan, a weak result will put pressure on the yuan.

China's economy, according to various estimates, is already the largest
in the world, pushing the US economy into second place. Therefore, the
publication of important macroeconomic indicators of this country has a
significant impact on world financial markets, primarily on the
positions of the yuan, other Asian currencies, the dollar, commodity
currencies, as well as on Chinese and Asian stock indices. China is the
largest buyer of raw materials and a supplier of a wide range of
finished products to the world commodity market.

In January 2021, the growth of the consumer inflation index was +1.0%
(-0.3% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)), and in February +0.6% (-0.2% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)).

Deterioration of macroeconomic indicators, including a decrease in
consumer inflation, may negatively affect the positions of the yuan, as
well as commodity currencies such as the Canadian, Australian, and New
Zealand dollars. To a greater extent, this applies to the Australian
dollar, since China is Australia's largest trade and economic partner.

According to the forecast, the consumer price index is expected to
decrease by -0.2% in May, but increase by 1.0% in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/).

The rise in the consumer inflation index will have a positive effect on
the quotes of the yuan, as well as commodity currencies. However, the
data worse than forecast and the relative decline in CPI may negatively
affect them.

###  **14:00 CAD Bank of Canada's decision on interest rate. Bank of
Canada's accompanying statement**

The Bank of Canada will decide on the interest rate. In March 2020, the
bank lowered the rate 3 times, bringing it to the level of 0.25% to
mitigate the economic damage from the novel coronavirus pandemic.

In an accompanying statement, the central bank of Canada said that the
decision is "aimed at supporting the financial system, which plays a
central role in lending to the economy, as well as laying the foundation
that will allow the economy to return to normal." The central bank also
said in a press release that the spread of the coronavirus and the
plummeting global oil prices combined are weighing heavily on Canadians
and the Canadian economy.

In fact, quantitative easing and a significant cut in the interest rate
should contribute to the weakening of the national currency.

The impact of the coronavirus on the Canadian economy and the country's
labor market (in March 2020, unemployment rose to 7.8% from 5.6% in
February, and the number of employed, as reported by Statistics Canada,
fell by 1.01 million), and weakness in the housing market is also
putting pressure on the Bank of Canada to further ease monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/).

However, the Bank of Canada is expected to keep its interest rate at
0.25% at its meeting on Wednesday.

Tough tone of the accompanying statement by the Bank of Canada on rising
inflation and the prospects for further tightening of monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)
will cause the Canadian dollar to strengthen. If the Bank of Canada
signals the need for soft monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), the Canadian currency will
decline.

###  **11:45 EUR The ECB's decision on interest rates**

The ECB will publish its decision on the key rate and on the deposit
rate. The ECB's tough stance on inflation and key interest rates
contributes to the strengthening of the euro, while the soft stance and
rate cuts weaken the euro. In September 2019, the European Central Bank
lowered its key interest rate on deposits by 0.1%, to -0.5%, for the
first time since March 2016, and began buying bonds worth 20 billion
euros a month, renewing the so-called quantitative easing program.
According to the ECB leaders, the balance of risks for the economic
prospects of the Eurozone "is still shifted to the negative side", and
"until inflation is in line" with the target level, which is just below
2%, the rate will remain low. The new forecasts of the ECB on rates and
the QE program can be viewed as a signal of the inclination to further
soften [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) amid the inflation reluctant to accelerate.

In addition to Brexit, trade conflicts, factors of political instability
in Europe, as well as the growing coronavirus pandemic, due to which
European countries are forced to introduce new quarantine restrictions
that negatively affect economic activity, are the main threats to the
European economy. Back in March 2020, the ECB signaled the possibility
of [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) easing, and the bank's representative admitted that the bank's
management could lower the already negative interest rates even more.

Probably, following the results of this ECB meeting, the key interest
rate will remain at the same level of 0%. The ECB's rate on deposits for
commercial banks is also likely to remain at -0.5%. At the same time,
there is a possibility that at this meeting the ECB will announce a new
program to stimulate the economy, which will put pressure on the euro.

###  **12:30 EUR Press conference of the ECB**

The press conference will be of utmost interest to market participants.
In its course, a surge in volatility is possible not only in the euro
quotes, but also in the entire financial market, if the ECB leaders make
unexpected statements. The ECB leaders will assess the current economic
situation in the Eurozone and comment on the ECB's rate decision. In
previous years, based on the results of some ECB meetings and subsequent
press conferences, the euro exchange rate changed by 3-5% in a short
time.

The softer tone of the statements will have a negative impact on the
euro. Conversely, a tough tone from ECB officials on central bank
monetary [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) will strengthen the euro.

###  **12:30 USD Consumer price index (excluding food and energy
products)**

Consumer Price Index (CPI) determines the change in prices of a selected
basket of goods and services for a given period and is a key indicator
for assessing inflation and changes in consumer preferences. Food and
energy have been excluded from this indicator to provide a more accurate
estimate. A high value strengthens the US dollar, while a low value
weakens it. In March 2021, the value of the indicator was +0.3% (+1.6%
in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)), and in April +0.9% and +3.0% (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)), which
indicates some improvement in the situation after the fall of the index
in March and April 2020 amid the coronavirus pandemic. If the data turns
out to be weaker than the forecast, the dollar is likely to respond with
a short-term decline. Better-than-forecast data will strengthen the
dollar. Forecast for May: +0.4% and +3.4% (in annual [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)), which is
likely to have a positive impact on the USD.

###  **Friday, June 11**

###  **All day: G7 summit**

The G7 summit is attended by finance ministers and heads of the Central
Banks of 7 most industrialized countries: Canada, Italy, France,
Germany, Japan, Great Britain and the United States. The goal of the G7
summit is to discuss the situation in the global economy. After the end
of the summit, an official statement on the objectives and results of
the meeting is published, which can have a significant impact on the
global financial markets.

###  **14:00 USD University of Michigan Consumer Confidence Index
(preliminary release)**

This indicator reflects the confidence of American consumers in the
economic development of the country. A high level indicates economic
growth, while a low level indicates stagnation. Previous values ​​of the
indicator: 82.9 in May, 88.3 in April, 84.9 in March, 76.8 in February,
79.0 in January 2021. An increase in the indicator will strengthen the
USD, while a decrease in the value will weaken the dollar. This
indicator is expected to be released in June with a value of 84.0. There
is a steady trend towards a gradual recovery in the growth of the
indicator, which is positive for the USD. The data worse than the
forecast may negatively affect the dollar in the short term.
